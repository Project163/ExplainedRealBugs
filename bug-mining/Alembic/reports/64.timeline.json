This is because\nMySQL doesn't actually have a \"unique constraint\" construct that\nreports differently than a \"unique index\", so it is present in both\nlists.  The net effect though is that the MySQL backend will report\na dropped unique index/constraint as an index in cases where the object\nwas first created as a unique constraint, if no other information\nis available to make the decision.
