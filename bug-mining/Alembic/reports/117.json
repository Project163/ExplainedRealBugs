This is an approximation as the bug is quite direct in the code.\n\n```py\ncontext.configure(alembic_module_prefix=\"test_op\")\n\n...\ndef process_revision_directives(context, revision, directives):\n    directive.ops = [ops.ExecuteSQLOp(sqltext=\"COMMIT\")]\n```\n\n\n**Error**\n\nGenerated SQL is\n```\nop.execute('COMMIT')\n```\n\nShould be\n```\ntest_op.execute('COMMIT')\n```\n\n**Versions.**\n - OS: macOS\n - Python: 3.10\n - Alembic: 1.15.2\n - SQLAlchemy: 2.0.40\n - Database: PostgreSQL\n - DBAPI:\n\n**Additional context**\n\nI have a fix ready to go, I think!
