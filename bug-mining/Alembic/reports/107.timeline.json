https://github.com/aiidateam/disk-objectstore/pull/114:\r\n\r\n- Added `SQLALCHEMY_WARN_20` environmental variable\r\n- Adressed all resulting warnings\r\n- Add `future=True` flag for engine and session creation (V1 -> v2 API)\r\n\r\nNote, each commit primarily address a single `SQLALCHEMY_WARN_20` warning.\r\n\r\nOne thing to note here is that the [Query](https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/14/orm/query.html#sqlalchemy.orm.Query) object, which we use in the `SqlaQueryBuilder`, has become a long term legacy object, replaced by the direct usage of the [select()](https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/14/core/selectable.html#sqlalchemy.sql.expression.select) construct, (see https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/14/changelog/migration_20.html#orm-query-unified-with-core-select).\r\nThis means that, although it would be good to replace, it is not strictly necessary for the v2
