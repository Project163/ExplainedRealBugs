Provide a general summary of your proposed changes in the Title field above -->\r\nUpdate the tests to make them run on windows\r\n### Description\r\n<!-- Describe your changes in detail -->\r\nThe main changes are:\r\n- Correctly manage the paths on windows vs *nix like system.\r\n- Manage the new lines \\r\\n vs \\n\r\n- Windows cannot remove open files, namely the sqlite db, so it keeps track of the connections and closes them before removing the files.\r\n\r\nI've tested with sqlite, postgres and mysql and all pass (on windows 10)\r\n\r\nThis fixes #632 \r\n### Checklist\r\n<!-- go over following points. check them with an `x` if they do apply, (they turn into clickable checkboxes once the PR is submitted, so no need to do everything at once)\r\n\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis pull request
