here.\nhttps://bitbucket.org/zzzeek/alembic/src/9650ccfb6841de45efdedb40de5b5f9d3d2f4582/alembic/ddl/mysql.py?at=master#cl-92\n\n\n\nTable in question:\n\n```\nvariant_value_association = Table(\n    'variant_value_association', Base.metadata,\n    Column('variant', ForeignKey('item_variant.id',\n                                 name='variant_value_association_variant_key'),\n           primary_key=True),\n    Column('attribute', Integer, primary_key=True),\n    Column('value', Unicode(64), nullable=False),\n    ForeignKeyConstraint(\n        ['attribute', 'value'],\n        ['variant_property_value.attribute', 'variant_property_value.value'],\n        name='variant_value_association_value_key'))\n\n```\n\nI think `correct_for_autogen_constraints` seems to be removing `idx` more than once for `col`s with the same `col.foreign_keys`.\n\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sqlalchemy/alembic/issues/240/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sqlalchemy/alembic/issues/240/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
