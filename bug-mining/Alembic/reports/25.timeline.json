The point is that it's reasonable to assume that a folder of Python modules could also be made into a Python package by adding an `__init__.py`. In most cases, this will not break things.

issue, originally created by Derek Harland ([@donkopotamus](https://github.com/donkopotamus))**\n\nIn my work its often the case that a particular revision would like to be able to access variables or call functions in another revision.\n\nFor example, consider a revision `db_09` that alters the definition of a view `SomeView` that was previously defined in `db_08`.  It would be nice to be able to have access to this previous definition somehow.  For example, supposing we have an class `db_view` that can create/drop itself, then we'd like to be able to do something like:\n\n```python\n# db_08\nsome_view = db_view(…)\n\ndef upgrade():\n    some_view.create()\n\ndef downgrade():\n    some_view.drop()\n\n```\nand\n```python\n# db_09\nsome_view = db_view(…)\n\ndef upgrade():\n    import db_08\n\n    # drop old definition, then create new version\n    db_08.some_view.drop()\n    some_view.create()\n\ndef downgrade():\n    # drop newer definition, create old version\n    some_view.drop()\n    db_08.some_view.create()\n```\n\nMore generally, it would be nice for `db_09` to be able to find the latest version prior to it that has a definition for `some_view` to help with the downgrade function … without having to know it was created in `db_03` for example.\n\nAnother time we may need this sort of functionality is when we alter a table that a view may depend on.  We may need to drop the current view definition before altering the table and then restoring the view.  (Another approach to this particular problem is to query the database to find all dependencies of the table (and their dependencies), grab their definitions and store for replay later.  But this is not really possible if you are in `--sql` mode)\n\nCurrently for example my code does something like:\n\n- beside the versions directory there is a `details` directory\n\n    - this contains the real upgrade/downgrade code for every version\n\n    - in a sense this is an implementation of issue #91\n\n- a version `XXX.py` in the `versions/` directory just calls its matching `details.XXX.upgrade/downgrade`\n\n- supporting functions then traverse the details submodules and allow us to get hold of the current and previous definitions of all views/procedures/functions etc.  (And allow us to store their definitions as plain txt files also)\n\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sqlalchemy/alembic/issues/173/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sqlalchemy/alembic/issues/173/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
