In case of upgrade, it is possible to abbreviate the revision strings (which, I think, is desirable). However, if I use the same abbreviated revision strings (in reverse order, of course) with downgrade --sql, I end up with KeyError.\n\nExample:\n\n```\n$ alembic -c file.ini history\nfc6f95f31aa -> 48c19228b1f6 (head), migration_2\n<base> -> fc6f95f31aa, migration_1\n\n$ alembic -c file.ini upgrade --sql fc6f:48c1\n[works fine]\n\n$ alembic -c file.ini downgrade --sql 48c1:fc6f\n  [...]\n  File \"[...]/site-packages/alembic-0.7.4-py2.7.egg/alembic/migration.py\", line 502, in update_to_step\n    self._update_version(from_, to_)\n  File \"[...]/site-packages/alembic-0.7.4-py2.7.egg/alembic/migration.py\", line 455, in _update_version\n    self.heads.remove(from_)\nKeyError: '48c19228b1f6'\n```\n\nI added some log.info()s to the program, and apparently \nself.heads is set(['48c1'])), while from_ is '48c19228b1f6',\nand therefore the key is not found from the heads.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","closed_by":{"login":"sqlalchemy-bot","id":36047385,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2MDQ3Mzg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/36047385?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot","html_url":"https://github.com/sqlalchemy-bot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sqlalchemy/alembic/issues/269/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sqlalchemy/alembic/issues/269/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
