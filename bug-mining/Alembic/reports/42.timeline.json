Alembic's architecture should support the feature but it requires that the sqlite implementation go through some much bigger hoops for these operations, namely that it has to rename the table and then fully recreate it minus the one column. \n\nGetting at the full table definition is the most tedious part.   drop_column() should, by default, use table reflection when invoked to get at the existing table def, so that it can be recreated.  This would be within the sqlite impl only.    drop_column() could also accept a fully formed Table object as an option, which the sqlite impl will make use of in lieu of reflection, in case the user wants to do it that way.  In particular the latter option would be needed if the user is running the migrations in offline mode as interpretation of reflection is not an offline concept.   It would then need to render a \"INSERT .. FROM SELECT\" to transfer data between the two tables, then finally drop the old table.\n\nSQLite's description of this operation is here:  http://sqlite.org/faq.html#q11.\n\nWhat is really ridiculous about the whole situation is that SQLite could *easily* implement this operation as a single command, and handle the details of copying the table's schema with no inaccuracies and no need to pull data into memory for

The structure of operations is in place and some docstrings, as well as autogenerate support. \n\nThe demo I've run is as follows:\n\n\n```\nfrom alembic.migration import MigrationContext\nfrom alembic.operations import Operations\n\nfrom sqlalchemy import create_engine, Column, Integer, String\n\neng = create_engine(\"sqlite://\", echo=True)\n\nconn = eng.connect()\nctx =

Integer)\n)\n\nwith op.batch_alter_table(\"table1\") as batch_op:\n    batch_op.alter_column('y', type_=Integer)\n    batch_op.drop_column('z')\n    batch_op.alter_column('x', new_column_name='q')\n\n\n```\n\nan abbreviated form of its output:\n\n\n```\nCREATE TABLE table1 (\n\tx INTEGER NOT NULL, \n\ty VARCHAR(50), \n\tz INTEGER, \n\tPRIMARY KEY (x)\n)\n\n\nSELECT sql FROM  (SELECT * FROM sqlite_master UNION ALL   SELECT * FROM sqlite_temp_master) WHERE name = 'table1' AND type = 'table'\n\nCREATE TABLE _alembic_batch_temp (\n\tx INTEGER NOT NULL, \n\ty INTEGER,

to get this feature out in 0.7.0 so I'll continue with
