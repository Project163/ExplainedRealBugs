So I'd disagree this is broken \"by default\" unless you can provide more detail.\n\nIt's not an option to simply \"print\" a stack trace like that.  It would be inconsistent vs. how all other errors are handled.  Unfortunately Mako does not yet provide the option of delivering a completely normal stack trace with the data within it replaced that can be re-raised; Jinja2 has such a feature and I've asked Armin many times to please provide that as a third party package so Mako can make use of it.   \n\nSo instead we have to do something like what Sphinx does, write it to a named temp file.  Also, an error in a template causes it to write a blank file right now and that is a more serious issue.\n\n","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sqlalchemy/alembic/issues/comments/441886171/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"sqlalchemy-bot","id":36047385,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2MDQ3Mzg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/36047385?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot","html_url":"https://github.com/sqlalchemy-bot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sqlalchemy/alembic/issues/comments/441886172","html_url":"https://github.com/sqlalchemy/alembic/issues/367#issuecomment-441886172","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sqlalchemy/alembic/issues/367","id":441886172,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ0MTg4NjE3Mg==","user":{"login":"sqlalchemy-bot","id":36047385,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2MDQ3Mzg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/36047385?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot","html_url":"https://github.com/sqlalchemy-bot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-04-09T01:32:31Z","updated_at":"2018-11-27T03:19:50Z","body":"**Michael
