The column was added, but the constraint was not created. I wasn't sure if this was operator error on my part, but thought I'd share it anyway:\n\nI made some model changes in my project and noticed that a foreign key constraint wasn't getting picked up when I ran migrate. Basically I had a blog `Entry` model and added a `User` model to represent the author. I also added a foreign key from the entry to the user.\n\nHere are portions of the models:\n\n```python\nclass Entry(db.Model):\n    id = db.Column(db.Integer, primary_key=True)\n    title = db.Column(db.String(100))\n    author_id = db.Column(db.Integer, db.ForeignKey('user.id'))  # New column\n\nclass User(db.Model):  # New model\n    id = db.Column(db.Integer, primary_key=True)\n```\n\nThis is the output of ``db migrate``:\n\n```\nINFO  [alembic.migration] Context impl SQLiteImpl.\nINFO  [alembic.migration] Will assume non-transactional DDL.\nINFO  [alembic.autogenerate.compare] Detected added table 'user'\nINFO  [alembic.autogenerate.compare] Detected added column 'entry.author_id'\n```\n\nHere is the migration:\n\n```python\n    ### commands auto generated by Alembic - please adjust! ###\n    op.create_table('user',\n    sa.Column('id', sa.Integer(), nullable=False),\n    ....\n    sa.PrimaryKeyConstraint('id'),\n    sa.UniqueConstraint('email'),\n    sa.UniqueConstraint('slug')\n    )\n    op.add_column(u'entry', sa.Column('author_id', sa.Integer(), nullable=True))\n    ### end Alembic commands ###\n```\n\nNotice that the foreign key constraint is missing.\n\nI upgraded the db and, while the `author_id` column is there, the foreign key constraint is not:\n\n```sql\nCREATE TABLE entry (\n\tid INTEGER NOT NULL, \n\ttitle VARCHAR(100), \n        author_id INTEGER, \n\tPRIMARY KEY (id), \n\tUNIQUE (slug)\n);\n```\n\nVersions: \n\n* Flask-Migrate==1.2.0\n* Flask-SQLAlchemy==1.0\n* SQLAlchemy==0.9.1\n* alembic==0.6.2\n\n","closed_by":{"login":"sqlalchemy-bot","id":36047385,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2MDQ3Mzg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/36047385?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot","html_url":"https://github.com/sqlalchemy-bot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sqlalchemy-bot/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sqlalchemy/alembic/issues/178/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sqlalchemy/alembic/issues/178/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
