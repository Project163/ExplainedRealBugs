            <title>[KAFKA-1902] fix MetricName so that Yammer reporter can work correctly</title>
                <link>https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KAFKA-1902</link>
                <project id="12311720" key="KAFKA">Kafka</project>
                    <description>&lt;p&gt;Currently, we create MetricName in the following format.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;group: &quot;kafka.server&quot;&lt;br/&gt;
type: &quot;BrokerTopicMetrics&quot;&lt;br/&gt;
name: &quot;BytesInPerSec&quot;&lt;br/&gt;
scope: null&lt;br/&gt;
mBeanName: &quot;kafka.server:type=BrokerTopicMetrics,name=BytesInPerSec,topic=test&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, Yammer metric reporter seems to only use the first four fields group, type, name and scope during reporting.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;scope: topic=test&lt;br/&gt;
scope: topic=test,partition=1&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="14293840" author="jbrosenberg@gmail.com" created="Tue, 27 Jan 2015 17:29:07 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;In the yammer metric reporter (which is based on the Graphite metric naming scheme: &lt;a href=&quot;https://graphite.readthedocs.org/en/latest/render_api.html#graphing-metrics&quot; class=&quot;external-link&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;https://graphite.readthedocs.org/en/latest/render_api.html#graphing-metrics&lt;/a&gt;), it&apos;s assumed that the metric name is comprised of components separated by dots, e.g. part1.part2.part3.part4.  These components make up branches in the navigation tree typically presented in a ui, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No spaces are allowed (the yammer metric reporter replaces spaces with dashes &apos;-&apos;).  But other characters are allowed, including &apos;=&apos;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The yammer metric name is a concatenation of the group, type, name, scope (with &apos;.&apos;s inserted between each).  But if any of these also have a &apos;.&apos; internal to them, then that will also result in a separate component, so if we have:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;code panel&quot; style=&quot;border-width: 1px;&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;codeContent panelContent&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;code-java&quot;&gt;group: &lt;span class=&quot;code-quote&quot;&gt;&quot;kafka.server&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
type: &lt;span class=&quot;code-quote&quot;&gt;&quot;BrokerTopicMetrics&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
name: &lt;span class=&quot;code-quote&quot;&gt;&quot;BytesInPerSec&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
scope: topic=my.topic.with.dots,partition=2
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This will result in the metric path (broken down by navigation components):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;code panel&quot; style=&quot;border-width: 1px;&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;codeContent panelContent&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;code-java&quot;&gt;kafka
server
BrokerTopicMetrics
BytesInPerSec
topic=my
topic
with
dots,partitions=2
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus, I don&apos;t think the inclusion of &apos;=&apos; and &apos;,&apos; really maps well here, if the kafka topic has dots in it.  Instead, I think it would be better to just have the scope be something like:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;code panel&quot; style=&quot;border-width: 1px;&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;codeContent panelContent&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;code-java&quot;&gt;scope: topicname.partition
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(e.g. scope: my.topic.with.dots.2 in the example above).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The bottom line is that jmx tag syntax doesn&apos;t necessarily map directly to a metric navigation path.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="14293854" author="kbanker" created="Tue, 27 Jan 2015 17:36:49 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;This definitely fixes the issue. I&apos;m now seeing all of the missing metrics, and if you go with this approach, we Graphite users should be fine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a couple of aesthetic issues we might consider, though, given that the Graphite convention is to use dot-separated names to form a hierarchy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1. Do we want topics under BrokerTopicMetrics to be indicated as &quot;topic=foo&quot; or would it be better to set the scope as &quot;Topics.foo&quot; to form a more natural Graphite hierarchy?&lt;br/&gt;
2. FetcherLagMetrics now show up as clientId=ReplicaFetcherThread-0-2,topic=foo,partition=0.&lt;br/&gt;
Alternative: ReplicaFetcherThread-0-2.Topics.foo.partition-0&lt;br/&gt;
3. Log metrics look like this: topic=foo,partition=1. A Graphite alternative would be: Topics.foo.partition1, Topics.foo.partition2, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, these metrics naming conventions skew toward the JMX standard. We can pretty easily work around that in the Graphite world, and keeping the format the same will probably make it easier to compare metrics across systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Either way, it will be a big change for those using Graphite.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="14293919" author="junrao" created="Tue, 27 Jan 2015 18:28:26 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;Thanks for the explanation. A couple of things: (1) Since tags can be topic, partition, node, clientId, etc, it&apos;s probably useful to include the tag name in scope. Otherwise, you don&apos;t know exactly what the value is for. For example, if you have topic=mytopic,clientId=myclientId, using a scope of just mytopic.myclientId, it&apos;s not clear which part is for which. (2) About using dots, I was thinking that we can have scope like the following&lt;br/&gt;
  scope: topic.test.partition.10&lt;br/&gt;
However, since topic and clientId allow dots, using the dot convention can be confusing. For example, if you have topic=mytopic.with.dot,clientId=myclientId.with.dot, the scope will look like &lt;br/&gt;
  topic.mytopic.with.dot.clientId.myclientId.with.dot&lt;br/&gt;
It&apos;s not clear if that&apos;s the hierarchy that everybody wants. Another problem with this convention is that it loses the info in the original tags. So, from the scope string, you can&apos;t easily recreate the original tags and their values. I am not sure if the dot convention is standard, but it seems it&apos;s specific to Graphite. So, we probably don&apos;t want to use a lossy naming convention just for the convenience of Graphite.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What if we just use the convention used in the patch, then you can customize your Graphite reporter to report the metric name in whatever format that you want?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another option is to put the value part in quotes. So you will have &lt;br/&gt;
  topic.&quot;mytopic.with.dot&quot;.clientId.&quot;myclientId.with.dot&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But that may have it&apos;s own complexity and problems.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="14294053" author="jbrosenberg@gmail.com" created="Tue, 27 Jan 2015 19:43:26 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;Since many people use the vanilla GraphiteReporter bundled with the yammer libraries, it&apos;s a bit of work to ask them to roll a custom Graphite reporter.  Further, a custom reporter would have to embed specific knowledge around kafka metric scopes (while still supporting lots of general metrics coming from other libraries and the app itself).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead, if we don&apos;t want to create a reasonably formatted scope string that is already compatible with yammer metrics (which generally assumes the graphite format), it might work best if the scope string is sanitized to replace all dots with underscores.  This way, the scope is simply a unique (but still human identifiable) string, and is readily usable without too much guessing about a reasonable format.  The string would then be guaranteed to be a single, unbroken navigable component of a graphite metric.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;topic=mytopic$with$dot,clientId=myclientId$with$dot&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="14294238" author="jjkoshy" created="Tue, 27 Jan 2015 21:40:13 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;It&apos;s unfortunate it seems graphite does not allow overriding the separator for hierarchy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jun, I&apos;m not sure if Jason meant the following when he mentioned replacing the dots with underscore - since he mentioned that it should be &quot;navigable&quot; (by which I presume hierarchy). i.e., it would be more like:&lt;br/&gt;
topic.mytopic$with$dot.clientid.myclientId$with$dot - i.e., this way a graphite user can browse the hierarchy as before (although the topic names are fudged). It definitely loses information as you pointed out but that is probably okay since the scope is really only relevant for the graphite reporter.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="14294239" author="jjkoshy" created="Tue, 27 Jan 2015 21:41:58 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;I meant mytopic$with$dot.myclientId$with$dot&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="14294261" author="jbrosenberg@gmail.com" created="Tue, 27 Jan 2015 21:55:44 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/ViewProfile.jspa?name=jjkoshy&quot; class=&quot;user-hover&quot; rel=&quot;jjkoshy&quot;&gt;jjkoshy&lt;/a&gt; I did mean to just replace all dots with underscores.  I wasn&apos;t suggesting we need sub-navigation within the scope piece (although that wouldn&apos;t be ok too).  I really don&apos;t like the &quot;$&quot;&apos;s though, cuz they are ugly to read.  The whole point is that this is human readable.  I&apos;m ok with underscores potentially coexisting with &apos;converted&apos; dots-to-underscores (would still be readable).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do topic and clientId not allow $?  What about dashes (&apos;-&apos;)?&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="14294286" author="junrao" created="Tue, 27 Jan 2015 22:06:45 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;Is graphite the only reporter using scope? t seems that there are ganglia, cvs, and console reporters as well. If we use mytopic$with$dot.myclientId$with$dot, we lose the tag info for other reporters. Actually, even for Graphite reporter, preserving the tag names are probably useful. Otherwise, you are not sure exactly what you are navigating into (e.g., groupId, clientId and topic sometimes can be the same). Using topic.mytopic$with$dot.clientid.myclientId$with$dot would be better, but it may make parsing a bit harder for other types of reporters, if they make use of scope.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="14294287" author="jbrosenberg@gmail.com" created="Tue, 27 Jan 2015 22:09:47 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;Actually, a red flag here too, is why are we using &apos;clientId&apos; in the metric name? Won&apos;t that change each time an app is restarted (or is it stable long term)?  If it&apos;s not stable, it should not be part of a metric name.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="14294289" author="junrao" created="Tue, 27 Jan 2015 22:11:02 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;In Kafka, topic/group/clientId can include only -, _ and dot, in addition to alpha numerics. The problem of replacing dot with - or _ is that looking at the scope string, you don&apos;t know if a - or _ is originally there or not. Some users may find preserving that info useful.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="14294299" author="junrao" created="Tue, 27 Jan 2015 22:16:22 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;clientId is useful because one may want to run multiple producer/consumer instances in the same jvm and clientId is our way of distinguishing the metrics from different instances. clientId is a configuration and typically doesn&apos;t change after a restart.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="14294309" author="kbanker" created="Tue, 27 Jan 2015 22:22:58 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;Couple ideas here:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1. &lt;a href=&quot;https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/ViewProfile.jspa?name=junrao&quot; class=&quot;user-hover&quot; rel=&quot;junrao&quot;&gt;junrao&lt;/a&gt; For what it&apos;s worth, the typical way of representing types in Graphite is with an extra level of hierarchy: i.e., instead of BrokerTopicMetrics.topic=foo, we&apos;d do BrokerTopicMetrics.Topics.foo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2. The character used to replace the dots in topic names could be configurable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3. The default replacement could indeed be underscores. This is, I believe, the standard convention used when a hostname is part of a Graphite metric: simply replace dots with underscores. (Note that although host names aren&apos;t allowed to have underscores in the real world, DNS names often do. Still, no confusion results).&lt;/p&gt;

                            <comment id="14294474" author="junrao" created="Wed, 28 Jan 2015 00:26:18 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;Making the replacing character configurable is actually not very easy and I think it&apos;s also a bit over killing. Do you know if the dot convention is followed in other reporters like Ganglia?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we do end up using the dot convention in scope name, I think we should use a replacing character other than - or _. The reasoning is that if you see an issue with a metric on a topic, you probably want to do some trouble-shooting on the topic. If you can&apos;t figure out the exact topic, this will be a problem. Yes, using $ is not very readable. However, it&apos;s probably better than not figuring out the exact topic name. Also, this only affects the case when dot is actually used in the tag value, which may not be common.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="14294499" author="jjkoshy" created="Wed, 28 Jan 2015 00:43:45 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;Jun - to answer your earlier question. I took a look at the GangliaReporter in metrics 2.x and it does seem that the ganglia reporter also uses the scope field. &lt;a href=&quot;http://grepcode.com/file/repo1.maven.org/maven2/com.yammer.metrics/metrics-ganglia/2.0.0-BETA18/com/yammer/metrics/reporting/GangliaReporter.java#447&quot; class=&quot;external-link&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;http://grepcode.com/file/repo1.maven.org/maven2/com.yammer.metrics/metrics-ganglia/2.0.0-BETA18/com/yammer/metrics/reporting/GangliaReporter.java#447&lt;/a&gt; So it seems that ganglia users should also be affected by this issue that Jason reported&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="14294545" author="kbanker" created="Wed, 28 Jan 2015 01:17:04 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/ViewProfile.jspa?name=junrao&quot; class=&quot;user-hover&quot; rel=&quot;junrao&quot;&gt;junrao&lt;/a&gt; Agree that the dot may not be common, which minimizes the problems with the &apos;$&apos;.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>

&lt;p&gt;Maybe that should be a feature request for Graphite devs?&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="14295359" author="jbrosenberg@gmail.com" created="Wed, 28 Jan 2015 16:33:49 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;For the record, at Square, we do use &apos;.&apos;&apos;s heavily in topic names (for whatever reason).  I don&apos;t think making graphite use configurable separators is too likely (or should be a dependency on this effort).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One point worth making (if not obvious), is that the ordering of tags should be stable (e.g. always have clientid come before topic? Or vice-versa?).&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="14295420" author="junrao" created="Wed, 28 Jan 2015 17:23:57 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;Updated reviewboard &lt;a href=&quot;https://reviews.apache.org/r/30321/diff/&quot; class=&quot;external-link&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;https://reviews.apache.org/r/30321/diff/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;

So, we can&apos;t put in chars like $ and = in scope. So, followed the suggestion by (1) using the dot convention; (2) replacing dot in tag value with _; (3) sort all tags alphabetically.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, scope will look like&lt;br/&gt;
clientid.myclientid.topic.mytopic&lt;br/&gt;
clientid.myclientId_with_dot.topic.mytopic_with_dot&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jason, Kyle,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One minor note: a comment in the patch says &quot;// convert dot to _ since jmx reporters typically use dot to represent hierarchy&quot;. I think you meant &quot;Graphite&quot; instead of &quot;JMX&quot;?&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
