            <title>[KAFKA-3197] Producer can send message out of order even when in flight request is set to 1.</title>
                <link>https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KAFKA-3197</link>
                <project id="12311720" key="KAFKA">Kafka</project>
                    <description>&lt;p&gt;The issue we saw is following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1. Producer send message 0 to topic-partition-0 on broker A. The in-flight request to broker A is 1.&lt;br/&gt;
2. The request is somehow lost&lt;br/&gt;
3. Producer refreshed its topic metadata and found leader of topic-partition-0 migrated from broker A to broker B.&lt;br/&gt;
4. Because there is no in-flight request to broker B. All the subsequent messages to topic-partition-0 in the record accumulator are sent to broker B.&lt;br/&gt;
5. Later on when the request in step (1) times out, message 0 will be retried and sent to broker B. At this point, all the later messages has already been sent, so we have re-order.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;    This patch adds a new configuration to the producer to enforce the maximum in flight batch for each partition. The patch itself is small, but this is an interface change. Given this is a pretty important fix, may be we can run a quick KIP on it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;    This patch did not remove max.in.flight.request.per.connection configuration because it might still have some value to throttle the number of requests sent to a broker. This is primarily for broker&apos;s interest.&lt;/p&gt;

Reqs can be sent out of order if there are retries. Could the order goal be achieved without adding another parameter to the (already long) config file but by using a combination of in flight requests=1 and (retries=0 or acks=1)? Thanks.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="15130761" author="becket_qin" created="Wed, 3 Feb 2016 17:51:15 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/ViewProfile.jspa?name=enothereska&quot; class=&quot;user-hover&quot; rel=&quot;enothereska&quot;&gt;enothereska&lt;/a&gt; The documentation of max.in.flight.request.per.connection did not say it explicitly, but I think followings are the guarantees we currently claim (or think) we are providing with different in.flight.request.per.connection and retries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1. retries = 0, regardless of in.flight.request.per.connection&lt;br/&gt;
Producer itself does not introduce reordering in this case (all messages are only sent once), but message send will very likely fail immediately when event such as leader migration occurs. Users probably only have three choices when message failure occurs: a) let it go so the message is dropped; b) close producer if user do not tolerate message loss or re-ordering; c) resend the message and have re-ordering (this re-ordering is introduced by user)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2. in.flight.request.per.connection &amp;gt;1 and retries &amp;gt; 0 (some reasonable number)&lt;br/&gt;
No worry about frequent message send failure, but re-order could happen when there is retry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3. in.flight.request.per.connection = 1 and retries &amp;gt; 0&lt;br/&gt;
No re-ordering and no frequent failure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The bug here breaks the 3rd guarantee which we thought we are providing.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>

The reality though is that everyone (or at least most users) interpret that to mean it is possible to achieve strict ordering within a partition which is necessary for several use-cases.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>

                            <comment id="15130806" author="enothereska" created="Wed, 3 Feb 2016 18:20:48 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/ViewProfile.jspa?name=jjkoshy&quot; class=&quot;user-hover&quot; rel=&quot;jjkoshy&quot;&gt;jjkoshy&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/ViewProfile.jspa?name=becket_qin&quot; class=&quot;user-hover&quot; rel=&quot;becket_qin&quot;&gt;becket_qin&lt;/a&gt; Makes sense. I can&apos;t help but think of the analogy to file systems. The only way to guarantee order is to do synchronous requests one at a time. Async requests can never guarantee order. I believe the current solution you are providing would work, but I wonder if it&apos;s worth taking a step back and simplifying the options (perhaps to just two: async ---with any number of requests outstanding &amp;#8212; and sync).&lt;/p&gt;</comment>

Having another configuration is a little confusing. If the only purpose for send &quot;sync&quot; is to send messages in order, making it clear in the configuration seems reasonable.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="15131451" author="jkreps" created="Thu, 4 Feb 2016 00:34:01 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;Would it be better to treat this more as a bug than a configurable thing in the in-flight=1 case? i.e. when would i have in-flight=1 and not want the reordering protection? I agree people are depending on that now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Slightly longer term I think we are actively picking up that idempotence/txn/semantics line of work and I think it is possible that whatever is done for idempotence might be the more principled solution as it could solve this problem even in the presence of pipelining. The idea here is that there is a sequence number per-partition which the server uses to dedupe, and this ensures that if one request fails all other pipelined requests on that partition also fail (and then retry idempotently) so that you don&apos;t reorder irrespective of the depth of the pipelining.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="15131507" author="becket_qin" created="Thu, 4 Feb 2016 01:23:27 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;Hey Jay,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, idempotent producer would solve the problem. And I completely agree that when people set in flight request to one they are expecting no re-ordering. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was initially thinking of treating in.flight.request.per.connection=1 as in.flight.batch.per.partition=1 implicitly needed. This does not need additional configuration. But there is a subtle difference in terms of performance. If a producer has a lot partitions to send to the same broker, theoretically we can allow in flight request &amp;gt; 1 as long as each request addresses distinct partitions. If we enforce in.flight.request=1, we lose this parallelism. But given this is what already there, so it is probably fine to leave it as is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&apos;ll update the patch to remove the newly added configuration but simply reuse in.flight.request.per.connection. Otherwise please let me know if you think the subtle optimization worth the configuration change.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="15132571" author="fpj" created="Thu, 4 Feb 2016 16:55:40 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;Treating it as a bug sounds right. In the example given in the description, when the producer connects to broker B, shouldn&apos;t it resend unacknowledged messages (0 in the example) over the new connection (to broker B in the example)? It can produce duplicates as has been pointed out, but eliminating duplicates is a separate matter.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="15132580" author="ijuma" created="Thu, 4 Feb 2016 16:58:51 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;I was wondering the same thing &lt;a href=&quot;https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/ViewProfile.jspa?name=fpj&quot; class=&quot;user-hover&quot; rel=&quot;fpj&quot;&gt;fpj&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="15132698" author="becket_qin" created="Thu, 4 Feb 2016 18:17:39 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/ViewProfile.jspa?name=fpj&quot; class=&quot;user-hover&quot; rel=&quot;fpj&quot;&gt;fpj&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/ViewProfile.jspa?name=ijuma&quot; class=&quot;user-hover&quot; rel=&quot;ijuma&quot;&gt;ijuma&lt;/a&gt; That was my first thinking as well. After a second thought it might be a little bit complicated for the current implementation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This approach needs the following works:&lt;br/&gt;
1. Detect leader movement on each metadata refresh.&lt;br/&gt;
2. If leader moves, that does not necessarily mean the request to old leader failed. We can always send the unacknowledged message to new leader, but that probably introduce duplicate almost every time leader moves.&lt;br/&gt;
3. Currently after batches leave the record accumulator, we only track them in requests. If leader migrates, now we need to peek into every in flight request, take out the batches to the partition whose leader moved, and re-enqueue them into record accumulator. This is even more intrusive because we store the batches in the ProduceResponseHandler which we don&apos;t even track today. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Compared with current approach, the benefit of doing that seems we potentially don&apos;t need to wait for request timeout if a broker is actually down. However, given the metadata refresh itself is usually triggered by request timeout, this benefit becomes marginal. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So while the idea of resend unacknowledged message to both old and new leader is natural and makes sense, it seems much more complicated and error prone based on our current implementation and does not buy us much.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="15133265" author="fpj" created="Thu, 4 Feb 2016 23:02:43 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/ViewProfile.jspa?name=becket_qin&quot; class=&quot;user-hover&quot; rel=&quot;becket_qin&quot;&gt;becket_qin&lt;/a&gt; thanks for the clarification. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;If leader moves, that does not necessarily mean the request to old leader failed. We can always send the unacknowledged message to new leader, but that probably introduce duplicate almost every time leader moves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I agree that duplicates are inconvenient, but in this scenario we aren&apos;t promising no duplicates, so I&apos;d rather treat the duplicates separately.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Currently after batches leave the record accumulator, we only track them in requests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The record accumulator point is a good one and I&apos;m not super familiar with that part of the code, so I don&apos;t have any concrete suggestion right now, but I&apos;ll have a closer look. However, &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;So while the idea of resend unacknowledged message to both old and new leader is natural and makes sense, it seems much more complicated and error prone based on our current implementation and does not buy us much.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;True, from your description, it sounds like the change isn&apos;t trivial. But let me ask you this: don&apos;t we ever have to retransmit messages after a leader change? If we do, then the code path for retransmitting on a different connection must be there. I&apos;m not super familiar with that part of the code, so I don&apos;t have any concrete suggestion right now, but I can have a look to see if I&apos;m able to help out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Currently the error handling and retry logic is in the response handler. We wait for a request to fail, reenqueue failed batches in that requests into accumulator and then resend. The part makes me feel uncomfortable is that we have to look into the in flight requests if we want to resend a potentially failed batch to new leader.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>

It can be done, but I think it would necessitate some weird APIs in &lt;tt&gt;InFlightRequests&lt;/tt&gt; since as Becket notes, we would need to also proactively fish out partitions from &lt;tt&gt;InFlightRequests&lt;/tt&gt; and retry those on the new leader.&lt;br/&gt;
I&#8217;m +1 on the patch apart from the minor comments, but will leave this open for a few more days in case anyone has further concerns or better ideas.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>

If we find a better way in the future, we can consider it then.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
