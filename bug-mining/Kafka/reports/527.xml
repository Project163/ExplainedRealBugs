I tried reproduce the case with 3 brokers and 2 topics with  replicationFactor 2 . Shutting down any or all of the brokers didn&apos;t cause this exception to be thrown.  Thanks.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="14096408" author="jjkoshy" created="Thu, 14 Aug 2014 01:39:31 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately I don&apos;t have reliable steps to reproduce - it shows up rarely: bring up a single broker and shut it down immediately - let me revisit this tomorrow and I&apos;ll get back to you.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="14097674" author="jjkoshy" created="Thu, 14 Aug 2014 21:17:25 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/ViewProfile.jspa?name=sriharsha&quot; class=&quot;user-hover&quot; rel=&quot;sriharsha&quot;&gt;sriharsha&lt;/a&gt; I tried reproducing this again and as I mentioned it is a&lt;br/&gt;
corner case so it is hard to catch. Anyway, here is the root cause:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This only happens during shutdown. We close out existing selection keys as&lt;br/&gt;
the requests are completed. When closing the key, we close the associated&lt;br/&gt;
channel (which decrements connection count) and then cancel the key.&lt;br/&gt;
Although the key is canceled, it will be removed from the selector only on&lt;br/&gt;
the next select. The shutdown process proceeds to close all the keys of the&lt;br/&gt;
selector (i.e., socket server&apos;s closeAll). However, the above key (and&lt;br/&gt;
associated closed channel) may still be there which is why we see this&lt;br/&gt;
exception.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I think we can swallow this error if we are shutting down and place a&lt;br/&gt;
comment in the code on why we are swallowing it.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>

&lt;p&gt;As an undesired side-effect of allowing the NoSuchElementException in the first place, the close() methods after dec() in the code below would not get called.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;code panel&quot; style=&quot;border-width: 1px;&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;codeContent panelContent&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;code-java&quot;&gt;  def close(channel: SocketChannel) {
    &lt;span class=&quot;code-keyword&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt;(channel != &lt;span class=&quot;code-keyword&quot;&gt;null&lt;/span&gt;) {
      debug(&lt;span class=&quot;code-quote&quot;&gt;&quot;Closing connection from &quot;&lt;/span&gt; + channel.socket.getRemoteSocketAddress())
      connectionQuotas.dec(channel.socket.getInetAddress)
      swallowError(channel.socket().close())
      swallowError(channel.close())
    }
  }
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

                            <comment id="14123463" author="bcalmac" created="Fri, 5 Sep 2014 19:48:25 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;Maybe, I don&apos;t know the code well enough to draw that conclusion. But what would be a good reason to allow the exception in the first place? The exception isn&apos;t caused by an external factor but by a programming error (the assumption that the Option always has a value).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This puts pressure on all methods up the call hierarchy to do a proper cleanup after a RuntimeException. The &lt;tt&gt;close()&lt;/tt&gt; method I mentioned was just an example. Why look for trouble?&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="14123543" author="jjkoshy" created="Fri, 5 Sep 2014 20:44:40 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;I think the main reason to allow the exception (as opposed to an existence check) is that it should never happen. If it does, then it is a bug and we need to know about it. We can either receive a runtime exception or do an existence check and log an error. There are a number of places elsewhere in the code where we expect keys to be present. If not it is a (potentially serious) bug - we would rather let an exception be thrown rather than do an existence check and log an error especially if it is a serious issue. In this case we traced the cause of this occurrence to a race condition that only happens during shutdown which is why swallowing at that point is reasonable since that is the only circumstance under which a missing key is possible (and okay). Going forward, if the exception shows up anytime other than shutdown then we will need to again debug why that is the case and fix it - e.g., if it is related to the same race condition then we should fix that race condition.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="14123563" author="bcalmac" created="Fri, 5 Sep 2014 20:57:10 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;OK, makes sense. Now, if this is the case, shouldn&apos;t the exception be swallowed as soon as possible as below:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;code panel&quot; style=&quot;border-width: 1px;&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;codeContent panelContent&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;code-java&quot;&gt;  def close(channel: SocketChannel) {
    &lt;span class=&quot;code-keyword&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt;(channel != &lt;span class=&quot;code-keyword&quot;&gt;null&lt;/span&gt;) {
      debug(&lt;span class=&quot;code-quote&quot;&gt;&quot;Closing connection from &quot;&lt;/span&gt; + channel.socket.getRemoteSocketAddress())
      swallowError(connectionQuotas.dec(channel.socket.getInetAddress)) &lt;span class=&quot;code-comment&quot;&gt;// known race condition may lead to NoSuchElementException
&lt;/span&gt;      swallowError(channel.socket().close())
      swallowError(channel.close())
    }
  }
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It might make no difference at runtime, but the code is more readable.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="14123613" author="jjkoshy" created="Fri, 5 Sep 2014 21:30:43 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;We can do that, but it does allow the error to go undetected (apart from the error log) and execution continues (even in the non-shutdown case). It is a bug if the element does not exist - i.e., execution should not proceed beyond this point which is what an exception provides. The swallow is okay in the shutdown code because we explicitly allow the key&apos;s non-existence there.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="14123623" author="bcalmac" created="Fri, 5 Sep 2014 21:35:06 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;You&apos;re right. Thanks for the explanation.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>

This issue happens when the shutdown process started in the broker and the SocketServer.Processor.run throws EOFException and it calls close(key) which deletes the key from connectionQuota and also calls key.cancel() but it doesn&apos;t remove the key from the Selector.keys until next selection process begins  &quot; Cancelled keys are removed from the key set during selection operations.&quot; (from java doc).&lt;br/&gt;
broker shutdown process calls SocketServer.shutdown() which goes through selector.keys and calls close on each of them since there is no selection operation happened cancelled key in the previous step still exist in selector.keys but its deleted from conncetionQuotas causing it throw that exception.&lt;br/&gt;
one way to fix this is to force the selection operation in closeAll() &lt;br/&gt;
this.selector.selectNow()&lt;br/&gt;
Its an unnecessary operation in closeAll but it will clear up any cancelled keys from selector.keys(). Please let me know your thoughts on this.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="14149798" author="jjkoshy" created="Fri, 26 Sep 2014 18:51:59 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;Oh now I remember this - the root cause is as described above and in my earlier comment. The original patch only prevents the exception from escaping which actually causes shutdown to hang. The error is still logged - which I thought was annoying but can be addressed by logging. From my last comment in the original RB:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks for the patch - this is what I had in mind. The stack trace still shows up in the log though - I forgot that although swallow keeps the exception from bubbling up further, it still logs the exception which is annoying.&lt;br/&gt;
However, the shutdown no longer hangs (as it used to) so your patch works.&lt;br/&gt;
So I think it would be reasonable to just change this to swallow (which means swallowWarn) and let the exception show up in the logs for now.&lt;br/&gt;
There is a separate effort to improve our logging convention and the current recommendation (for this instance) is to avoid showing the stack trace. That will be done in the jiras that come out of &lt;a href=&quot;https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/Kafka+Error+Handling+and+Logging&quot; class=&quot;external-link&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/Kafka+Error+Handling+and+Logging&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;</comment>

Shutdown process goes through fine for me apart from the exception showing up in logs. Were you able to reproduce this by following steps in &lt;a href=&quot;https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KAFKA-1652&quot; title=&quot;NoSuchElementException on server shutdown&quot; class=&quot;issue-link&quot; data-issue-key=&quot;KAFKA-1652&quot;&gt;&lt;del&gt;KAFKA-1652&lt;/del&gt;&lt;/a&gt; with one broker . &lt;/p&gt;</comment>

Finally, just hard killed the broker and all of this happened within 2 minutes. Will try to reproduce again and spend more time collecting the thread dump. Also, thinking again, I&apos;m actually not a 100% sure that I could reproduce the hang on latest trunk. It is possible that I hadn&apos;t rebased my local trunk &lt;img class=&quot;emoticon&quot; src=&quot;https://issues.apache.org/jira/images/icons/emoticons/smile.png&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; width=&quot;16&quot; align=&quot;absmiddle&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</comment>

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps it was only committed to trunk? Is there any chance this will be included in 0.8.2?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&apos;s the stack trace: &lt;/p&gt;

In both cases the broker had something around 30000 partitions and controlled shutdown finished successfully. This is a nine node cluster and each was similarly loaded. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I should be able to get you the logs if it helps to debug.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>

I have noticed this when switching across git hashes that include changes to our build mechanism. Do a gradlew clean and ensure that &quot;find . -name kafka*.jar&quot; returns nothing and then rebuild before trying to reproduce this.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
