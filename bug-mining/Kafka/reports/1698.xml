                    <description>&lt;p&gt;If a partition of a topic with idempotent producer has no data on 1 of the brokers, but it does exist on others and some of the segments for this partition have been already deleted replication thread responsible for this partition on the broker which has no data for it fails to start with out of order sequence exception:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We run kafka 0.11.0.1 and we ran into the situation when 1 of replication threads was stopped for few days, while everything else on that broker was functional. This is our staging cluster and retention is less than a day, so everything for partitions for which replication thread was down was cleaned up. At the moment we have a broker which cannot start replication for few partitions. I was also able to reproduce in my local test environment.&lt;br/&gt;
Another possible use case when this might cause real pain is disk failure or any situation when previously deleting all the data for the partition on a broker helped - since it would just fetch all the data from other replicas. Now it does not work for topics with idempotent producers. It might also affect other not-idempotent topics if those are unlucky to share same replication fetcher thread. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This seems to be caused by this logic: &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/apache/kafka/blob/0.11.0.1/core/src/main/scala/kafka/log/ProducerStateManager.scala#L119&quot; class=&quot;external-link&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;https://github.com/apache/kafka/blob/0.11.0.1/core/src/main/scala/kafka/log/ProducerStateManager.scala#L119&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and might be fixed in the scope of &lt;a href=&quot;https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KAFKA-5793&quot; class=&quot;external-link&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KAFKA-5793&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However any hints on how to get those partition to fully replicated state are highly appreciated.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

                            <comment id="16188815" author="apurva" created="Mon, 2 Oct 2017 20:56:10 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;hi &lt;a href=&quot;https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/ViewProfile.jspa?name=schizhov&quot; class=&quot;user-hover&quot; rel=&quot;schizhov&quot;&gt;schizhov&lt;/a&gt;, thanks for filing the JIRA and providing those details. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think one important detail needs to be clarified: My understanding is that this replica fetcher thread stopped due to an unrelated error, and when it was restarted, it would fail again with the &lt;tt&gt;OutOfOrderSequenceException&lt;/tt&gt;. Is this correct?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks,&lt;br/&gt;
Apurva&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="16188863" author="schizhov" created="Mon, 2 Oct 2017 21:20:33 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;Well in the case we had in staging it was out of order sequence exception for some other topic/partition. I still need to investigate why exactly did that happen. Based on my later experiments I am pretty sure that it does not seem to matter how exactly it gets to that state with no data for a partition on one of the brokers.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="16188909" author="apurva" created="Mon, 2 Oct 2017 21:48:46 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;Thanks &lt;a href=&quot;https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/ViewProfile.jspa?name=schizhov&quot; class=&quot;user-hover&quot; rel=&quot;schizhov&quot;&gt;schizhov&lt;/a&gt;. this is indeed a gap in the current logic, on both 1.0.0 and 0.11.0.1. We should be able to handle the loss of producer state on the replica by simply accepting the leader as the source of truth. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for a workaround, the only thing I can think of at this point is to rebuild the replica from scratch &lt;img class=&quot;emoticon&quot; src=&quot;https://issues.apache.org/jira/images/icons/emoticons/sad.png&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; width=&quot;16&quot; align=&quot;absmiddle&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="16188924" author="schizhov" created="Mon, 2 Oct 2017 21:59:26 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;Thanks &lt;a href=&quot;https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/ViewProfile.jspa?name=apurva&quot; class=&quot;user-hover&quot; rel=&quot;apurva&quot;&gt;apurva&lt;/a&gt;! By rebuilding &quot;from scratch&quot; - do you mean dropping all the data in that partition? What about disabling idempotence in the producer and waiting until all &quot;idempotent&quot; messages are cleaned up - should that work? &lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="16188927" author="apurva" created="Mon, 2 Oct 2017 22:03:57 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;The answer to both your questions is &apos;yes&apos;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1. dropping all data on the replica and making it rereplicate will get the state back in sync.&lt;br/&gt;
2. stopping idempotent writes and waiting for the producer id to be expired will eventually allow the replica to fetch from the leader again.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="16188937" author="schizhov" created="Mon, 2 Oct 2017 22:12:31 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;thank you, but that replica does not have any data already and it cant re-replicate from the leader. So I dont think I understand your first point.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="16188959" author="apurva" created="Mon, 2 Oct 2017 22:21:21 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;Sorry, I meant that need to decommission the old replica and create a new replica by rereplicating from the leader (through the reassignment tool). That will bring the state of the new replica in sync with the leader. The patch I am preparing will essentially make the replica accept the leader&apos;s state without validation when it has no local state of its own.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>

Even rebuilding a replica from scratch will hit this same bug, because the leader&apos;s sequences most likely will not start from zero. So the first append on the replica during reassignment will also fail.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="16189014" author="schizhov" created="Mon, 2 Oct 2017 23:06:06 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;Aha! Got it. Will try reassigning then. Used to think though that after partition reassignment new broker would be exactly in the same position as the current one and thus fail replicating as well. &lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="16189022" author="schizhov" created="Mon, 2 Oct 2017 23:11:29 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;OK. Then I will not try reassigning &lt;img class=&quot;emoticon&quot; src=&quot;https://issues.apache.org/jira/images/icons/emoticons/smile.png&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; width=&quot;16&quot; align=&quot;absmiddle&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot;/&gt; . &lt;/p&gt;</comment>

                            <comment id="16189082" author="apurva" created="Mon, 2 Oct 2017 23:59:00 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, I don&apos;t think there is an ETA for 0.11.0.2 at this time. 0.11.0.1 was just released a couple of weeks ago.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="16189731" author="schizhov" created="Tue, 3 Oct 2017 13:53:17 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;So to summarise the impact:&lt;br/&gt;
In case there is a topic with finite retention and an idempotent producer there is very high risk of not being able to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;alternate&quot; type=&quot;square&quot;&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;replace a dead broker&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;scale up cluster&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;reassign partitions (BTW I did try it and it failed in the same way)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;p&gt;If the above is true it renders idempotent producer feature pretty much unusable.&lt;br/&gt;
Please correct me if I am wrong.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="16189937" author="apurva" created="Tue, 3 Oct 2017 16:33:33 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately your summary is correct &lt;img class=&quot;emoticon&quot; src=&quot;https://issues.apache.org/jira/images/icons/emoticons/sad.png&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; width=&quot;16&quot; align=&quot;absmiddle&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have tests which actually do cluster expansion / replica movement, but unfortunately the workload in those tests doesn&apos;t include idempotent messages, so we didn&apos;t catch this. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We will update the tests to use the idempotent producer so that we can catch any further bugs in these scenarios. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For now, we can start the conversation about the 0.11.0.2 release on the mailing list, and see what the community thinks of a quick release just to fix this issue.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>

&lt;p&gt;    This is a port of #4004 for the 0.11.0 branch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;    With this patch so that we &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; validate appends which originate&lt;br/&gt;
    from the client. In general, once the append is validated and written to&lt;br/&gt;
    the leader the first time, revalidating it is undesirable since we can&apos;t&lt;br/&gt;
    do anything if validation fails, and also because it is hard to maintain&lt;br/&gt;
    the correct assumptions during validation, leading to spurious&lt;br/&gt;
    validation failures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;    For example, when we have compacted topics, it is possible for batches&lt;br/&gt;
    to be compacted on the follower but not on the leader. This case would&lt;br/&gt;
    also lead to an OutOfOrderSequencException during replication. The same&lt;br/&gt;
    applies to when we rebuild state from compacted topics: we would get&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;commit 0a6a0213c091c8e6b6a9c5ce7655b7e0d06c9db0&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;    &lt;a href=&quot;https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KAFKA-6003&quot; title=&quot;Replication Fetcher thread for a partition with no data fails to start&quot; class=&quot;issue-link&quot; data-issue-key=&quot;KAFKA-6003&quot;&gt;&lt;del&gt;KAFKA-6003&lt;/del&gt;&lt;/a&gt;: Accept appends on replicas and when rebuilding state from&lt;br/&gt;
    the log unconditionally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;    With this patch so that we &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; validate appends which originate&lt;br/&gt;
    from the client. In general, once the append is validated and written to&lt;br/&gt;
    the leader the first time, revalidating it is undesirable since we can&apos;t&lt;br/&gt;
    do anything if validation fails, and also because it is hard to maintain&lt;br/&gt;
    the correct assumptions during validation, leading to spurious&lt;br/&gt;
    validation failures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;    For example, when we have compacted topics, it is possible for batches&lt;br/&gt;
    to be compacted on the follower but not on the leader. This case would&lt;br/&gt;
    also lead to an OutOfOrderSequencException during replication. The same&lt;br/&gt;
    applies to when we rebuild state from compacted topics: we would get&lt;br/&gt;
    gaps in the sequence numbers, causing the OutOfOrderSequence.&lt;/p&gt;

So now there are no plans to have that fixed in 0.11.0.2 as far as I can see from the fix version of this ticket - or are there still? Can you please shed some light on this?&lt;br/&gt;
Thank you.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>

We should absolutely fix this in an 0.11.0.2 release. The only open question is &lt;em&gt;when&lt;/em&gt; that release will happen: we don&apos;t have a date yet. I think it should happen sooner rather than later, personally.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
