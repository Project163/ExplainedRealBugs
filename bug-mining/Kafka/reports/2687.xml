            <title>[KAFKA-9848] Avoid triggering scheduled rebalance delay when task assignment fails but Connect workers remain in the group</title>
                <link>https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KAFKA-9848</link>
                <project id="12311720" key="KAFKA">Kafka</project>
                    <description>&lt;p&gt;There are cases where a Connect worker does not receive its tasks assignments successfully after a rebalance but will still remain in the group. For example when a SyncGroup response is lost, a worker will not get its expected assignments but will rejoin the group immediately and will trigger another rebalance. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With incremental cooperative rebalancing, tasks assignments that are computed and sent by the leader but are not received by any of the members are marked as lost assignments in the subsequent rebalance. The presence of lost assignments activates the scheduled rebalance delay (property) and the missing tasks are not assigned until this delay expires.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This situation can be improved in two cases: &lt;br/&gt;
a) When it&apos;s the leader that failed to receive the new assignments from the broker coordinator (for example if the SyncGroup request or response was lost). If this worker remains the leader of the group in the subsequent rebalance round, it can detect that the previous assignment was not successfully applied by checking what&apos;s the expected generation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;b) If one or more regular members did not receive their assignments successfully, but have joined the latest round of rebalancing, they can be assigned the tasks that remain unassigned from the previous assignment immediately without these tasks being marked as lost. The leader can detect that by checking that some tasks seem lost since the previous assignment but also the number of workers is unchanged between the two rounds of rebalancing. In this case, the leader can go ahead and assign the missing tasks as new tasks immediately.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
