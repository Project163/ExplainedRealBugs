   <h3>Finalizing the migration</h3>
   <p>
     Once all brokers have been restarted in KRaft mode, the last step to finalize the migration is to take the
     KRaft controllers out of migration mode. This is done by removing the "zookeeper.metadata.migration.enable"
     property from each of their configs and restarting them one at a time.
   </p>
+  <p>
+    Once the migration has been finalized, you can safely deprovision your ZooKeeper cluster, assuming you are
+    not using it for anything else. After this point, it is no longer possible to revert to ZooKeeper mode.

+  <h3>Reverting to ZooKeeper mode During the Migration</h3>
+  <p>
+    While the cluster is still in migration mode, it is possible to revert to ZooKeeper mode.  The process
+    to follow depends on how far the migration has progressed. In order to find out how to revert,
+    select the <b>final</b> migration step that you have <b>completed</b> in this table.
+  </p>
+  <p>
+    Note that the directions given here assume that each step was fully completed, and they were
+    done in order. So, for example, we assume that if "Enter Migration Mode on the Brokers" was
+    completed, "Provisioning the KRaft controller quorum" was also fully completed previously.
+  </p>
+  <p>
+    If you did not fully complete any step, back out whatever you have done and then follow revert
+    directions for the last fully completed step.
