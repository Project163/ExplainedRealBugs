-ZooKeeper also allows you to add a "chroot" path which will make all kafka data for this cluster appear under a particular path. This is a way to setup multiple Kafka clusters or other applications on the same ZooKeeper cluster.

Data will be load balanced over all servers irrespective of which servers are specified here for bootstrapping&mdash;this list only impacts the initial hosts used to discover the full set of servers. This list should be in the form <code>host1:port1,host2:port2,...</code>. Since these servers are just used for the initial connection to discover the full cluster membership (which may change dynamically), this list need not contain the full set of servers (you may want more than one, though, in case a server is down). If no server in this list is available sending data will fail until on becomes available.</td></tr>

-	<td>acks</td><td>string</td><td>1</td><td>high</td><td>The number of acknowledgments the producer requires the leader to have received before considering a request complete. This controls the  durability of records that are sent. The following settings are common:  <ul> <li><code>acks=0</code> If set to zero then the producer will not wait for any acknowledgment from the server at all. The record will be immediately added to the socket buffer and considered sent. No guarantee can be made that the server has received the record in this case, and the <code>retries</code> configuration will not take effect (as the client won't generally know of any failures). The offset given back for each record will always be set to -1. <li><code>acks=1</code> This will mean the leader will write the record to its local log but will respond without awaiting full acknowledgement from all followers. In this case should the leader fail immediately after acknowledging the record but before the followers have replicated it then the record will be lost. <li><code>acks=all</code> This means the leader will wait for the full set of in-sync replicas to acknowledge the record. This guarantees that the record will not be lost as long as at least one in-sync replica remains alive. This is the strongest available guarantee. <li>Other settings such as <code>acks=2</code> are also possible, and will require the given number of acknowledgements but this is generally less useful.</td></tr>

If records are sent faster than they can be delivered to the server the producer will either block or throw an exception based on the preference specified by <code>block.on.buffer.full</code>. <p>This setting should correspond roughly to the total memory the producer will use, but is not a hard bound since not all memory the producer uses is used for buffering. Some additional memory will be used for compression (if compression is enabled) as well as for maintaining in-flight requests.</td></tr>

-	<td>compression.type</td><td>string</td><td>none</td><td>high</td><td>The compression type for all data generated by the producer. The default is none (i.e. no compression). Valid  values are <code>none</code>, <code>gzip</code>, or <code>snappy</code>. Compression is of full batches of data,  so the efficacy of batching will also impact the compression ratio (more batching means better compression).</td></tr>

-	<td>retries</td><td>int</td><td>0</td><td>high</td><td>Setting a value greater than zero will cause the client to resend any record whose send fails with a potentially transient error. Note that this retry is no different than if the client resent the record upon receiving the error. Allowing retries will potentially change the ordering of records because if two records are sent to a single partition, and the first fails and is retried but the second succeeds, then the second record may appear first.</td></tr>

This helps performance on both the client and the server. This configuration controls the default batch size in bytes. <p>No attempt will be made to batch records larger than this size. <p>Requests sent to brokers will contain multiple batches, one for each partition with data available to be sent. <p>A small batch size will make batching less common and may reduce throughput (a batch size of zero will disable batching entirely). A very large batch size may use memory a bit more wastefully as we will always allocate a buffer of the specified batch size in anticipation of additional records.</td></tr>

-	<td>client.id</td><td>string</td><td></td><td>medium</td><td>The id string to pass to the server when making requests. The purpose of this is to be able to track the source of requests beyond just ip/port by allowing a logical application name to be included with the request. The application can set any string it wants as this has no functional purpose other than in logging and metrics.</td></tr>
-	<tr>
-	<td>linger.ms</td><td>long</td><td>0</td><td>medium</td><td>The producer groups together any records that arrive in between request transmissions into a single batched request. Normally this occurs only under load when records arrive faster than they can be sent out. However in some circumstances the client may want to reduce the number of requests even under moderate load. This setting accomplishes this by adding a small amount of artificial delay&mdash;that is, rather than immediately sending out a record the producer will wait for up to the given delay to allow other records to be sent so that the sends can be batched together. This can be thought of as analogous to Nagle's algorithm in TCP. This setting gives the upper bound on the delay for batching: once we get <code>batch.size</code> worth of records for a partition it will be sent immediately regardless of this setting, however if we have fewer than this many bytes accumulated for this partition we will 'linger' for the specified time waiting for more records to show up. This setting defaults to 0 (i.e. no delay). Setting <code>linger.ms=5</code>, for example, would have the effect of reducing the number of requests sent but would add up to 5ms of latency to records sent in the absense of load.</td></tr>

Note that the server has its own cap on record size which may be different from this. This setting will limit the number of record batches the producer will send in a single request to avoid sending huge requests.</td></tr>

This timeout is measured on the server side and does not include the network latency of the request.</td></tr>

By default this setting is true and we block, however in some scenarios blocking is not desirable and it is better to immediately give an error. Setting this to <code>false</code> will accomplish that: the producer will throw a BufferExhaustedException if a recrord is sent and the buffer space is full.</td></tr>

-	<td>metadata.fetch.timeout.ms</td><td>long</td><td>60000</td><td>low</td><td>The first time data is sent to a topic we must fetch metadata about that topic to know which servers host the topic's partitions.

-	<tr>
-	<td>metric.reporters</td><td>list</td><td>[]</td><td>low</td><td>A list of classes to use as metrics reporters. Implementing the <code>MetricReporter</code> interface allows plugging in classes that will be notified of new metric creation. The JmxReporter is always included to register JMX statistics.</td></tr>

When a window expires we erase and overwrite the oldest window.</td></tr>

-	<td>reconnect.backoff.ms</td><td>long</td><td>10</td><td>low</td><td>The amount of time to wait before attempting to reconnect to a given host when a connection fails. This avoids a scenario where the client repeatedly attempts to connect to a host in a tight loop.</td></tr>
-	<tr>
-	<td>retry.backoff.ms</td><td>long</td><td>100</td><td>low</td><td>The amount of time to wait before attempting to retry a failed produce request to a given topic partition. This avoids repeated sending-and-failing in a tight loop.</td></tr>
-	<tr>
-	<td>max.in.flight.requests.per.connection</td><td>int</td><td>5</td><td>low</td><td>The number of "in-flight requests" on a given connection is the number of requests currently awaiting acknowledgement on that connection. When the number of in-flight requests is equal to this number, the client will wait for one of them to be acknowledged before sending the next request to that node. It's important to note that one request corresponds to a batch of messages, so increasing this number too much can cause suboptimal batching behavior in the client. This is because the client will not wait long enough to let messages batch together into large batches, and will instead send many small requests which are much less efficient to process. You can explicitly instruct the client to wait a certain amount of time until more messages are available to batch by setting <code>linger.ms</code>. In addition, setting this number high increase throughput but can cause out-of-order message arrivals.</td></tr>
