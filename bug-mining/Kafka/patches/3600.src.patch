+            has been added to data partitions to prevent hanging transactions. Workloads with compression can experience InvalidRecordExceptions and UnknownServerExceptions.
+            This feature can be disabled by setting <code>transaction.partition.verification.enable</code> to false. Note that the default for 3.6 is true.
+            The configuration can also be updated dynamically and is applied to the broker.
+            This will be fixed in 3.6.1. See <a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KAFKA-15653">KAFKA-15653</a> for more details.
