The URL is malformed with the double `//`after the port number. \n\nI changed the `go_notify.conf` file  `api-server-host = \"http://localhost:8153\"` (notice the missing trailing `/`) but I still get the same issue in the slack notifications.\n\nThen I changed `server-host = \"http://localhost:8153\"` (again notice the missing trailing `/`), and it fixed the issue. I no longer see the same issue in the slack notifications. \n\nSo it looks like the code that parses the conf doesn't support trailing `/`? \n\nIt might be helpful updating the `readme.md` as well as it contains an example conf with trailing `/`\n","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ashwanthkumar/gocd-slack-build-notifier/issues/comments/211830940/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"dennislo","id":598330,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5ODMzMA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/598330?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dennislo","html_url":"https://github.com/dennislo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dennislo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dennislo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dennislo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dennislo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dennislo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dennislo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dennislo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dennislo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dennislo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":632659529,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50NjMyNjU5NTI5","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ashwanthkumar/gocd-slack-build-notifier/issues/events/632659529","actor":{"login":"ashwanthkumar","id":600279,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYwMDI3OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/600279?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashwanthkumar","html_url":"https://github.com/ashwanthkumar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashwanthkumar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashwanthkumar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashwanthkumar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashwanthkumar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashwanthkumar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashwanthkumar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashwanthkumar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashwanthkumar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashwanthkumar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2016-04-19T09:52:09Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":632659530,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDYzMjY1OTUzMA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ashwanthkumar/gocd-slack-build-notifier/issues/events/632659530","actor":{"login":"ashwanthkumar","id":600279,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYwMDI3OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/600279?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashwanthkumar","html_url":"https://github.com/ashwanthkumar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashwanthkumar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashwanthkumar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashwanthkumar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashwanthkumar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashwanthkumar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashwanthkumar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashwanthkumar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashwanthkumar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashwanthkumar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2016-04-19T09:52:09Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":632659533,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50NjMyNjU5NTMz","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ashwanthkumar/gocd-slack-build-notifier/issues/events/632659533","actor":{"login":"dennislo","id":598330,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5ODMzMA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/598330?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dennislo","html_url":"https://github.com/dennislo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dennislo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dennislo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dennislo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dennislo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dennislo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dennislo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dennislo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dennislo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dennislo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2016-0
