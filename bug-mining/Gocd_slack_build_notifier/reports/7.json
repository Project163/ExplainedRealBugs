We need this because we want to grant users access to config file under source control - so they could add their own pipelines notifications for their own channels. I've tried any possible way I could for using environment variables in config, but no luck - plugin always fails to start with the messages like:\n\n```\nFelixGoPluginOSGiFramework:124 - Failed to load plugin: plugins_work/gocd-slack-notifier-1.2.2.jar.
