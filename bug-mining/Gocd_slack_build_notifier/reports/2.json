Notifications for all rules are being sent to the primary `gocd.slack.channel` if configured, and if it is not configured, are being sent to the default channel configured in the slack webhook integration.\n\nGiven a slack webhook integration with a default channel of `#general`, and this partial config:\n\n```\ngocd.slack {\n  channel = \"#gocd\"\n  pipelines = [{\n    name = \"foo\"\n    channel = \"#foo\"\n  }]\n}\n```\n\nI would expect notifications for pipeline `foo` to be sent to `#foo` Slack channel. However, all notifications for pipeline `foo` are being sent to the `#gocd` Slack channel. If I remove the `channel = \"#gocd\"` configuration option, all notifications for pipeline `foo` are sent to the default `#general` channel.\n","closed_by":{"login":"mgreensmith","id":1601951,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MDE5NTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1601951?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgreensmith","html_url":"https://github.com/mgreensmith","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgreensmith/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgreensmith/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgreensmith/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgreensmith/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgreensmith/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgreensmith/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgreensmith/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgreensmith/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgreensmith/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ashwanthkumar/gocd-slack-build-notifier/issues/22/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ashwanthkumar/gocd-slack-build-notifier/issues/22/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
