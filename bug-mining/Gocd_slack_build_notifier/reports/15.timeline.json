I've been working on a version of this kind of feature where you could configure notification settings to pipelines via environment variables. The idea is to let global settings for all pipelines to be configured via plugin settings which then could be overridden with the pipeline environment variables. The variables would be `GO_SLACK_CHANNEL`, `GO_SLACK_STAGES` and `GO_SLACK_STATUSES`.\n\nThis change will require admin username and password to be configured for the plugin so that the plugin can get the pipeline configurations. Also it will require require GoCD version 15.3 or above which added the pipeline config API.\n\nI have already implemented the basic plugin settings and the environment variable support.

\nWe have currently several projects used by different project teams on our GoCD server. With the current way each team would either have to have admin access to the GoCD server or ask the admins to change the configurations for their project pipelines. This change would make it slightly faster for the teams or team's pipeline group admins to manage the configurations themselves and try out which notification level works best for them.\n\nBut you're right that usually this is a one time operation and it doesn't require that much effort. And if you are using a configuration management system the file based configuration is the easiest way to handle this.\n\nUsing environment variables would require many changes to the existing pipelines if it is not possible to configure them using the suggested global configuration. And configuring the notifications for each pipeline would take some time if done via UI. If there would be both the file and this environment variable based configuration it would give the admins a possibility to configure the global settings via Ansible/Chef while the project pipeline group admins would have the freedom to configure the notification settings by themselves. \n\nIn future once GoCD gets the support for the SCM based pipeline configuration (https://github.com/gocd/gocd/issues/1133) the environment variable based configuration could make it possible to each project team to set the notification settings straight from the SCM.\n","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ashwanthkumar/gocd-slack-build-notifier/issues/comments/192714146/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"juhasipo","id":317264,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxNzI2NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/317264?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/juhasipo","html_url":"https://github.com/juhasipo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juhasipo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juhasipo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juhasipo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juhasipo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juhasipo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juhasipo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juhasipo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juhasipo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juhasipo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":578930865,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50NTc4OTMwODY1","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ashwanthkumar/gocd-slack-build-notifier/issues/events/578930865","actor":{"login":"ashwanthkumar","id":600279,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYwMDI3OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/600279?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashwanthkumar","html_url":"https://github.com/ashwanthkumar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashwanthkumar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashwanthkumar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashwanthkumar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashwanthkumar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashwanthkumar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashwanthkumar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashwanthkumar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashwanthkumar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashwanthkumar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2016-03-05T19:36:44Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":578930866,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDU3ODkzMDg2Ng==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ashwanthkumar/gocd-slack-build-notifier/issues/events/578930866","actor":{"login":"ashwanthkumar","id":600279,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYwMDI3OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/600279?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashwanthkumar","html_url":"https://github.com/ashwanthkumar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashwanthkumar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashwanthkumar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashwanthkumar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashwanthkumar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashwanthkumar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashwanthkumar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashwanthkumar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashwanthkumar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashwanthkumar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2016-03-05T19:36:44Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ashwanthkumar/gocd-slack-build-notifier/issues/comments/195193649","html_url":"https://github.com/ashwanthkumar/gocd-slack-build-notifier/issues/7#issuecomment-195193649","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ashwanthkumar/gocd-slack-build-notifier/issues/7","id":195193649,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE5NTE5MzY0OQ==","user":{"login":"ashwanthkumar","id":600279,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYwMDI3OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/600279?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashwanthkumar","html_url":"https://github.com/ashwanthkumar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashwanthkumar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashwanthkumar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashwanthkumar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashwanthkumar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashwanthkumar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashwanthkumar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashwanthkumar/repos","events_url":"https:/
