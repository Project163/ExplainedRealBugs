This is a simple issue with big repercussions. It highlights many problems that are showing up at the same moment in other issues around parallelism. I'd appreciate your reading what I've found and giving me your comments...\r\n\r\n1. Start and end shift messages in the log do not appear in the right order when a SetUpFixture is present. Sometimes shifts are nested or overlap. Shifts, of course, are supposed to be self-contained with no two shifts active at the same time.\r\n\r\n2. We end shifts when there may still be items running, which may directly execute additional child items on the same thread.\r\n\r\n3. When we end a shift, we immediately restore all queues. But there may be items to run in the other queues, which do not pertain to that shift.\r\n\r\nHere's how I think we got here. We had a pretty clean object model for parallel execution in \"shifts\" to start out. I refactored it after the initial implementation to make it into a hierarchy: dispatcher => shifts => queues and workers.\r\n\r\nSubsequently however, in fixing some problems, we bolted on some things that don't quite match the object model. I did some of it myself, in fact. In particular, we wanted to have a stack of real queues, so that each non-parallel item with parallel children could finish all it's work before anyone else got to run. Logically, that called for a new level in the hierarchy to control one set of queues. As a matter of expediency, we didn't do that and now we are suffering.\r\n\r\nI'm working two ideas in parallel: trying to think of what the model ought to have been while patching further the existing model. Ideas are

I assume you meant that when you said \"ensure that all the classes are cheap to create and that any resource usage like thread creation is postponed till needed.\"\r\n\r\nLike @ChrisMaddock I also saw 2 and 3 while testing his possible fix. As for selecting from the two models that you present above, I think it requires too much knowledge of the problem space, but the second `MasterController` seems to be a simpler approach as it will be a central point of coordination, but maybe I am reading too much into the names 😄 ","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nunit/nunit/issues/comments/332357617/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"rprouse","id":493828,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5MzgyOA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/493828?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rprouse","html_url":"https://github.com/rprouse","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rprouse/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rprouse/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rprouse/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rprouse/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rprouse/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rprouse/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rprouse/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rprouse/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rprouse/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":1266743295,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MTI2Njc0MzI5NQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nunit/nunit/issues/events/1266743295","actor":{"login":"ChrisMaddock","id":4837132,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4MzcxMzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4837132?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChrisMaddock","html_url":"https://github.com/ChrisMaddock","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChrisMaddock/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChrisMaddock/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChrisMaddock/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChrisMaddock/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChrisMaddock/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChrisMaddock/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChrisMaddock/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChrisMaddock/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChrisMaddock/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2017-09-26T22:44:31Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
