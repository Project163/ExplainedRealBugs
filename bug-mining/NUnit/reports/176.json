If we set this to true, MSBuild can't override them.  We can't set it all from Cake since some information there is target framework dependent.  We can't roll that out by compiling for each frameworks, because our projects have different target frameworks.\r\n\r\nSo the resolution is to generate an AssemblyInfo.g.cs file in the build.cake script, and run that before the build starts.  This file is then added to the framework, framework.legacy and the nunitlite projects.   The others don't need any version.\r\n\r\nThanks to @CharliePoole for finding this!
