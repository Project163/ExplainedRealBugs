behaviour of a IgnoreUntil-Attribute, we have used it some years ago in the way, that we have examined the attribute using an addin. If the ignore-until-date has been in the past, the addin has simply removed the attribute and the test has been executed, no matter if the result was \"failed\" or \"passed\", this is up to the test itself. I can remember that some of the guys have even requested to define a test-id or feature-id to the test and get the ignore-until-date from some external maintained file, that would have the information about when a certain feature should be finished with implementation, so that the test should no longer be ignored to that date. However this idea was never realized. Still i vote for to decouple test execution information (which i believe ignore-until belongs to) from the test itself. The test should not know when it will get executed, it should just know how to do the test. Test execution information on  a test does not really fulfill the SRP, the test should be responsable for how to test and the execution should be responsable about what test to execute when and some other thing should be responsable for the results of the execution of a test.

But every attribute that classifies \"a test's current situation\" doesn't belong to the sourcecode of the test (and the attributes are part of the source), it belongs to a pool regarding the tests history. Example: Test A ran every month in 2013 and was always \"passed\", just in month \"8\" it was \"failed\" due to a bug in the testee. So this is a history. Would it make sense to glue every testresult as a attribute in front of the test
