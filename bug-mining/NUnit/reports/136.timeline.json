In addition, equivalency tests with large unsortable collections run faster by determining if the collections are sortable before attempting to sort them.\n\nWe've added several fixes for .NET 6.0 and we've stopped testing NUnit against .NET Core 2.1 which is now out of support.\n\nThere are also several fixes for the new `FixtureLifeCycle` feature and other smaller bug fixes and performance improvements.\n\nFor more information, please see the complete [Framework Release Notes](https://docs.nunit.org/articles/nunit/release-notes/framework.html)\n\n## 3.13.2\n\nThis release fixes a new issue with the `FixtureLifeCycle` attribute where `IDisposable` test fixtures were not being disposed properly. As always, [@​gleb-osokin](https://github.com/gleb-osokin) has been a great help with this new feature.\n\nIt also fixes a long-standing performance issue with `CollectionAssert.AreEquivalent` and the `CollectionEquivalentConstraint` when comparing large collections. The deep comparison that NUnit performs on the two collections will always have a worst case bound of O(n^2) but we have optimized it so that the majority of use cases will be closer to O(n).\n\nWe've also made significant optimizations to the OR filters for selecting tests using their full name. This dramatically improves test performance for large code bases that use `dotnet test`. Thanks to [@​pakrym](https://github.com/pakrym) for his help with this.\n\nFor more information, please see the complete [Framework Release Notes](https://docs.nunit.org/articles/nunit/release-notes/framework.html)\n\n## 3.13.1\n\nThis release addresses several misses with the new `FixtureLifeCycle` attribute, switches to using [SourceLink](https://github.com/dotnet/sourcelink) and NuGet [snupkg](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/nuget/create-packages/symbol-packages-snupkg) packages for debugging into NUnit from your unit tests. It also addresses issues with the time format of ignored and explicit tests in the test results file.\n\nFor more information, please see the complete [Framework Release Notes](https://docs.nunit.org/articles/nunit/release-notes/framework.html)\n\n## 3.13\n\nThe [`FixtureLifeCycle`](https://docs.nunit.org/articles/nunit/writing-tests/attributes/fixturelifecycle.html) attribute has been added to indicate that an instance for a test fixture or all test fixtures in an assembly should be constructed for each test within the fixture or assembly.\n\nThis attribute may be applied to a test fixture (class) or to a test assembly. It is useful in combination with the [Parallelizable Attribute](https://docs.nunit.org/articles/nunit/writing-tests/attributes/parallelizable.html) so that a new instance of a test fixture is constructed for every test within the test fixture. This allows tests to run in isolation without sharing instance fields and properties during parallel test runs. This makes running parallel tests easier because it is easier to make your tests thread-safe.\n\nThis release also fixes several issues running tests in .NET 5.0. If your tests target .NET 5.0, we recommend updating to this release.\n\nFor more information, please see the complete [Framework Release Notes](https://docs.nunit.org/articles/nunit/release-notes/framework.html)\n\n## 3.12\n\nThis release of NUnit finally drops support for .NET 2.0. If your application still targets .NET 2.0, your tests will need to target at least .NET 3.5. Microsoft ended support for .NET 2.0 on July 12, 2011. Microsoft recommends that everyone migrate to at least .NET Framework 3.5 SP1 for security and performance fixes.\n\nThis release dramatically improves NUnit support for async tests including returning ValueTask and custom tasks from tests, improved handling of SynchronizationContexts and better exception handling.\n\nThe .NET Standard 2.0 version of NUnit continues to gain more functionality that is found in the .NET 4.5 version of the framework like setting the ApartmentState and enabling Timeout on tests.\n\n## 3.11\n\n * More informative assertion messages\n * PlatformAttribute is available on .NET Standard 2.0 and now detects .NET Core\n * ValuesAttribute now works with nullable types\n * Async tests detecting and running Windows Forms or WPF message pumps rather than deadlocking\n * Support for UWP 10.0 is back via .NET Standard 1.4\n\n## 3.10.1\n\nAdded a namespace to the props file included in the NuGet package to make it compatible with versions of Visual Studio prior to VS 2017.\n\n## 3.10\n\nThis release adds a .NET Standard 2.0 version of the framework which re-enables most of the features that have been missing in our earlier .NET Standard builds like parallelism, timeouts, directory and path based asserts, etc. It also contains numerous bug fixes and smaller enhancements. We've improved our XML docs, fixed performance issues and added more detail to Multiple Asserts.\n\nThis release also contains source-indexed PDB files allowing developers to debug into the NUnit Framework. This allows you to track down errors or see how the framework works.\n\nIn order to support the .NET Standard 2.0 version, the NUnit project switched to the new CSPROJ format and now requires Visual Studio 2017 to compile. This only effects people contributing to the project. NUnit still supports building and compiling your tests in older .NET IDEs and NUnit still supports older versions of the .NET Framework back to 2.0. For contributors, NUnit can now compile all supported targets on Windows, Linux and Mac using the Cake command line build.\n\n## 3.9\n\nThis release addresses numerous parallelization issues that were introduced in 3.8 when method level parallelization was added. Most of the parallelization issues resolved were tests never completing when using some combinations of parallel tests and `ApartmentState` not being properly applied to tests in all cases.\n\n## 3.8.1\n\nThis release fixes two critical regressions in the 3.8 release. The first caused the console runner to crash if you are using test parameters. The second issue caused collection constraints checking for multiple items in a collection to fail.\n\n#### Issues Resolved\n\n * [2386](https://github.com/nunit/nunit/issues/2386) Contains.Item() fails for collections in NUnit 3.8\n * [2390](https://github.com/nunit/nunit/issues/2390) Missing value attribute in test parameters setting causes NullReferenceException in console\n\n## 3.8\n\nThis release removes several methods and attributes that were marked obsolete in the\noriginal 3.0 release. Support for iOS and Android has been improved.\n\nAn issue that caused unit tests to run slower was addressed as was a bug that prevented\nthe use of Assert.Multiple in async code.\n\nThe Order attribute can now also be applied to the class level to set the order\nthat test fixtures will be run.\n\n#### Issues Resolved\n\n * [345](https://github.com/nunit/nunit/issues/345) Order of Fixture Execution\n * [1151](https://github.com/nunit/nunit/issues/1151) Include differences in output for Is.EquivalentTo\n * [1324](https://github.com/nunit/nunit/issues/1324) Remove CollectionContainsConstraint\n * [1670](https://github.com/nunit/nunit/issues/1670) Attaching files to the test result\n * [1674](https://github.com/nunit/nunit/issues/1674) InRange-Constraint must work with object\n * [1851](https://github.com/nunit/nunit/issues/1851) TestCaseSource unable to pass one element byte array\n * [1996](https://github.com/nunit/nunit/issues/1996) Timeout does not work if native code is running at the time\n * [2004](https://github.com/nunit/nunit/issues/2004) Has.One as synonym for Has.Exactly(1).Items\n * [2062](https://github.com/nunit/nunit/issues/2062) TestCaseSource attribute causes test to pass when source is not defined\n * [2144](https://github.com/nunit/nunit/issues/2144) Allow option on RandomAttribute to produce distinct values\n * [2179](https://github.com/nunit/nunit/issues/2179) Some NUnit project's tests fail on systems with CultureInfo other than en\n * [2195](https://github.com/nunit/nunit/issues/2195) Contains.Substring with custom StringComparison\n * [2196](https://github.com/nunit/nunit/issues/2196) Expose ParallelizableAttribute (and other attribute) constructor arguments as properties\n * [2201](https://github.com/nunit/nunit/issues/2201) Invalid platform name passed to PlatformAttribute should mark test NotRunnable\n * [2208](https://github.com/nunit/nunit/issues/2208) StackFIlter trims leading spaces from each line\n * [2213](https://github.com/nunit/nunit/issues/2213) SetCultureAttribute: CultureInfo ctor should use default culture settings\n * [2217](https://github.com/nunit/nunit/issues/2217) Console runner performance varies wildly depending on environmental characteristics\n * [2219](https://github.com/nunit/nunit/issues/2219) Remove Obsolete Attributes\n * [2225](https://github.com/nunit/nunit/issues/2225) OneTimeTearDown and Dispose Ordering\n * [2237](https://github.com/nunit/nunit/issues/2237) System.Runtime.Loader not available for iOS/Android\n * [2242](https://github.com/nunit/nunit/issues/2242) Running tests directly should never surface a NullReferenceException\n * [2244](https://github.com/nunit/nunit/issues/2244) Add KeyValuePair<TKey, TValue> to the default formatters\n * [2251](https://github.com/nunit/nunit/issues/2251) Randomizer.NextGuid()\n * [2253](https://github.com/nunit/nunit/issues/2253) Parallelizable(ParallelScope.Fixtures) doesn't work on a TestFixture\n * [2254](https://github.com/nunit/nunit/issues/2254) EqualTo on ValueTuple with Nullable unexpected\n * [2261](https://github.com/nunit/nunit/issues/2261) When an assembly is marked with ParallelScope.None and there are Parallelizable tests Nunit hangs\n * [2269](https://github.com/nunit/nunit/issues/2269) Parallelizable and NonParallelizable attributes on setup and teardown silently ignored\n * [2276](https://github.com/nunit/nunit/issues/2276) Intermittent test failures in Travic CI: TestContextTests\n * [2281](https://github.com/nunit/nunit/issues/2281) Add type constraint for Throws and any method requiring Exception\n * [2288](https://github.com/nunit/nunit/issues/2288) Killing thread cancels test run\n * [2292](https://github.com/nunit/nunit/issues/2292) Is.Ordered.By() with a field throws NullReferenceException\n * [2298](https://github.com/nunit/nunit/issues/2298) Write TestParametersDictionary to xml result file in readable format\n * [2299](https://github.com/nunit/nunit/issues/2299) NUnitLite NuGet package no longer installs NUnit NuGet package\n * [2304](https://github.com/nunit/nunit/issues/2304) Revert accidental doc removal\n * [2305](https://github.com/nunit/nunit/issues/2305) Correct misprint \".con\" -> \".com\"\n * [2312](https://github.com/nunit/nunit/issues/2312) Prevent crash on invalid --result parsing in NUnitLite\n * [2313](https://github.com/nunit/nunit/issues/2313) Incorrect xmldoc on RetryAttribute\n * [2332](https://github.com/nunit/nunit/issues/2332) Update build script to use NUnitConsoleRunner v3.7.0\n * [2335](https://github.com/nunit/nunit/issues/2335) Execute OneTimeTearDown as early as possible when running fixtures in parallel\n ... (truncated)\n\n## 3.7.1\n\nThis is a hotfix release that addresses occasional hangs when using test parallization and fixes crashes in NCrunch prior to version 3.9.\n\n## 3.7\n\nThis release of NUnit expands on parallel test execution to allow test methods to be run in parallel. Please see the [Parallelizable Attribute](https://github.com/nunit/docs/wiki/Parallelizable-Attribute) for more information.\n\nNUnit 3.7 also drops the Portable build of the framework and replaces it with a .NET Standard 1.3 version to complement the .NET Standard 1.6 version. This change enables several constraints and other features in the .NET Standard builds that weren't available in portable like Path and Directory based asserts.\n\nThe `AssertionHelper` class has been deprecated because it is seldom used and has not received any of the updates that Asserts and Constraints receive. If your code is using the `AssertionHelper` class, we recommend that you migrate your asserts.\n\n## 3.6.1\n\nThis is a hotfix release of the framework that addresses critical issues found in the 3.6 release.\n\n#### Issues Resolved\n- 1962 A Theory with no data passes\n- 1986 NUnitLite ignores --workers option\n- 1994 NUnitLite runner crashing when --trace is specified\n- 2017 Two NUnit project's tests fail on systems with comma decimal mark settings\n- 2043 Regression in 3.6.0 when catching AssertionException\n\n\n## 3.6\n\nThis release of the framework no longer includes builds for Compact Framework or for SilverLight, but adds a .NET Standard 1.6 build. If anyone still using Compact Framework or SilverLight and would like to continue development on those versions of the framework, please contact the NUnit team.\n\n#### Framework\n- .NET Standard 1.6 is now supported\n- Adds support for Multiple Assert blocks\n- Added the --params option to NUnitLite\n- Theories now support Nullable enums\n- Improved assert error messages to help differentiate differences in values\n- Added warnings with Warn.If(), Warn.Unless() and Assert.Warn()\n- Enabled Path, File and Directory Asserts/Contraints for .NET Core testing\n- Added NonTestAssemblyAttribute for use by third-party developers to indicate that their assemblies reference the NUnit framework, but do not contain tests\n\nSee the [release notes](https://github.com/nunit/docs/wiki/Release-Notes) for a complete list of changes.\n\n\n## 3.5\n\nThis is the first version of NUnit where the framework will be released separately from the\nconsole runner, engine and other extensions. From this point forward, the NUnit Framework will be\nreleased on its own schedule that is not bound to that of any other NUnit project and version numbers\nmay diverge over time.\n\nThis is also the first release where the NUnit Framework will not be included in the installer. Only\nthe console runner, engine and extensions will be available as an MSI installer. We recommend that you\nuse the NUnit NuGet packages for the framework, but a ZIP file with the binaries will also be available.\n\n#### Framework\n- Added Assert.Zero and Assert.NotZero methods\n- Tests with a Timeout will no longer timeout while you are debugging\n\nSee the [release notes](https://github.com/nunit/docs/wiki/Release-Notes) for a complete list of changes.\n\n\n## 3.4.1\n\n### Console Runner\n- A new option, --list-extensions, will display all the engine extensions that\n  have been installed by the engine.\n\n### Issues Resolved\n- 1623 NUnit 3.4 is not integrated with TeamCity\n- 1626 NUnit.ConsoleRunner is not picking up NUnit.Extension.NUnitV2ResultWriter\n- 1628 Agent's process stays in memory when it was failed to unload AppDomain\n- 1635 Console option to list loaded extensions\n\n\n## 3.4\n\n### Framework\n- Improvements in comparing equality using IEquatable<T>\n- Test case names will only be truncated if the runner requests it or it is overridden on the command line\n  with the --test-name-format option\n- The .NET 2.0 version of the framework now includes LINQ. If your tests target .NET 2.0, you can now use\n  LINQ queries in your tests\n\n### Engine\n- The TeamCity event listener has been separated out into an engine extension\n- Fixed numerous issues around thread safety of parallel test runs\n- Additional fixes to reduce memory usage\n- Fixes for Mono 4.4\n\n### Console Runner\n- There is a new --params command line option that allows you to pass parameters to your tests\n  which can be retrieved using TestContext.Parameters\n- Another new command line option --loaduserprofile causes the User Profile to be loaded into the\n  NUnit Agent process.\n\nSee the [release notes](https://github.com/nunit/docs/wiki/Release-Notes) for a complete list of changes.\n\n\n## 3.2.1\n\nThis is mainly a bugfix release, but it contains several features that were intended for the 3.4 release.\n\nNUnit 3.2 introduced a change that ran each test on its own thread. In hindsight, this was a mistake and made it difficult for tests that required a specific context. We have reverted to the previous behaviour of running tests on the same thread unless a test attribute requires a new thread. We also added a new `[SingleThreaded]` attribute that you can apply to your test fixture to explicitly declare the requirement. Using this attribute allows the framework to raise an error if you mistakenly use an attribute on a test that requires a new thread.\n\nDevelopers who target .NET 3.5 using the .NET 2.0 version of the framework ran into conflicts with some of the compatibility classes in NUnit. To fix this, we have reinstated the .NET 3.5 version of NUnit.\n\nVery large test suites were using a large amount of memory causing paging and slow test runs on some systems. To reduce memory pressure, we are now releasing objects earlier, greatly reducing memory requirements.\n\nThe NUnit Engine now has an [EventListener extension point](https://github.com/nunit/docs/wiki/Event-Listeners) for people who want to write extensions that respond to specific events during test runs.\n\nFor a full list of issues fixed in this release, please see the [release notes](https://github.com/nunit/docs/wiki/Release-Notes).\n\n\n## 3.2\n\nIn addition to numerous bug fixes, this release adds the long requested `OrderAttribute`, a new `Assert.ThrowsAsync`, `Assert.That(0, Is.Zero)` and other enhancements.\n\nFor a full list of issues fixed in this release, please see the [release notes](https://github.com/nunit/docs/wiki/Release-Notes).\n\n\n## 3.0.1\n\nThis release fixes critical issues reported against the initial 3.0 release, mainly around compatibility producing the NUnit 2 XML output format and async support for Windows 10. For a full list of issues fixed in this release, please see the [release notes](https://github.com/nunit/docs/wiki/Release-Notes).\n\n\n## 3.0\n\nThis is the final release of NUnit 3.0. See the release notes for details of all its features.\n\n\n## 3.0.0-rc-3\n\nThis release fixes some errors in RC2 and is expected to be the final RC.\n\n\n## 3.0.0-rc-2\n\nThis is the second release candidate for NUnit 3.0 which fixes a few issues that were found in the initial release. All the features we intend to include are present and this is the final step before releasing. If we have to make changes due to errors there will be additional release candidates. Otherwise, this build will be re-packaged as the final release.\n\nFor details of changes in this release, see the [release notes](https://github.com/nunit/docs/wiki/Release-Notes).\n\n\n## 3.0.0-rc\n\nThis is the initial release candidate for NUnit 3.0. All the features we intend to include are present and this is the final step before releasing. If we have to make changes due to errors there will be additional release candidates. Otherwise, this build will be re-packaged as the final release.\n\nFor details of changes in this release, see the release notes at https://github.com/nunit/docs/wiki/Release-Notes\n\n\n## 3.0.0-beta-5\n\nThis is the fifth beta release of NUnit 3.0. We had a number of new features added and decided to have an additional beta before the final release.\n\nFor changes to the beta-5 release as well as cumulative changes see the release notes at https://github.com/nunit/docs/wiki/Release-Notes\n\n\n## 3.0.0-beta-4\n\nThis is the fourth beta release of NUnit 3.0. We hope this will be the last beta before the final release, but will make the decision after reviewing the outstanding issues.\n\nFor changes to the beta-4 release as well as cumulative changes see the release notes at https://github.com/nunit/nunit/wiki/Release-Notes\n\n\n## 3.0.0-beta-3\n\nThis is the third beta release of NUnit 3.0. We are planning one more beta next month before the final release.\n\nThis release changes the Engine API, so **if you have a previous 3.0 release installed, you must uninstall it before installing this release.**\n\nFor changes to the beta-3 release as well as cumulative changes see the release notes at https://github.com/nunit/nunit/wiki/Release-Notes\n\n\n## 3.0.0-beta-2\n\nThis is the second beta release of NUnit 3.0 bringing us one step closer to the final release. This release splits the distribution of the Compact Framework version of the NUnit Framework out of the main package and adds a new core engine for use by devices and similar situations where reduced functionality is compensated for by reduced size and simplicity of usage. \n\nFor changes to the beta-2 release as well as cumulative changes see the release notes at https://github.com/nunit/nunit/wiki/Release-Notes\n\n\n## 3.0.0-beta-1\n\nThis is the first beta release of NUnit 3.0.\n\nFor changes to the beta-2 release as well as cumulative changes see the release notes at https://github.com/nunit/nunit/wiki/Release-Notes\n\n\n## 3.0.0-alpha-5\n\nThis is the fifth (and probably last) Alpha release of NUnit 3.0. It adds some important features, including implementation of addins in the test engine and provision of Windows installers for the framework and console runner.\n\n\n## 3.0.0-alpha-4\n\nThis latest Alpha release of NUnit 3.0 adds several new features, including a driver that allows the 3.0 Test Engine to run tests created under NUnit 2.x and support for both NUnit and Visual Studio project formats.\n\n\n## 3.0.0-alpha-3\n\nThis is the third alpha release of NUnit 3.0. See the Release Notes on the website or the CHANGES.txt document in the source folder for details.\n\n\n## 3.0.0-alpha-2\n\nThis is the second alpha release of NUnit 3.0, fixing a number of bugs and limitations in the first alpha. See the Release Notes on the website or the CHANGES.txt document in the source folder for details.\n\n\n## 3.0.0-alpha\n\nThis is the first true release of NUnit 3.0, after many months of pre-releases in the 2.9.x series.\n\nIt's still and alpha-level release, so we don't recommend it for production work. On the other hand, it's suitable for selective use on individual projects.\n\nCurrently, documentation is lacking but it's being developed. What is available may be seen at http://nunit.org\n\n\n## 2.9.7\n\nThis is the final pre-alpha release of NUnit 3.0.\n\nNOTE: The CHANGES.txt file included with the release is incorrect and does not include the latest changes.
