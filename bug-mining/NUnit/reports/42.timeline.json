Fixes #674 \n\nThis is a temporary, localized fix until we decide whether to use mono.cecil for reflecting on assemblies. The references are retrieved by use of a ReflectionOnlyLoad in a separate AppDomain, which is immediately unloaded.\n\nBased on stepping through the code, this works well, but it has not been tested with the VS adapter yet.\n\nNote that there is another ReflectionOnlyLoad in the TestEngineActivator class which is still being done in the primary AppDomain.
