2.6 has a RepeatAttribute. It's currently #ifed out of our 3.0 source. We need to decide if we are going to implement it as is or make some changes. People ask for it (sometimes for bad reasons) so I don't think it should be simply dropped.\n\nCurrent semantics are that the test is run n times or until it fails, whichever comes first. IOW, it has to pass all n times in order to pass.\n\nWe have had requests in the past for only repeating the test in the case of failure. IOW, it would be more like a Retry attribute.\n\nConceivably, we could generalize this to repeating the test up to n times subject to some rules specified in additional arguments. We could expose the options to the user if we liked or we could simply use such a generalized repeat facility as a base class for various attributes.\n\nWe also have a request for ThreadedRepeat, which would run the tests n times on different threads. See #5.\n\nI'm marking this issue as status:design. We should first come up with a spec for what we are going to support and then incorporate the result into 3.0.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nunit/nunit/issues/478/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nunit/nunit/issues/478/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":279204925,"node_id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDI3OTIwNDkyNQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nunit/nunit/issues/events/279204925","actor":{"login":"CharliePoole","id":2678661,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2Nzg2NjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2678661?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole","html_url":"https://github.com/CharliePoole","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2015-04-12T18:38:00Z","label":{"name":"easyfix","color":"009800"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nunit/nunit/issues/comments/92099112","html_url":"https://github.com/nunit/nunit/issues/585#issuecomment-92099112","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nunit/nunit/issues/585","id":92099112,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDkyMDk5MTEy","user":{"login":"CharliePoole","id":2678661,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2Nzg2NjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2678661?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole","html_url":"https://github.com/CharliePoole","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-04-12T18:38:55Z","updated_at":"2015-04-12T18:38:55Z","body":"This will be an easy fix once RepeatAttribute is done because it will look a lot like it in the code.
