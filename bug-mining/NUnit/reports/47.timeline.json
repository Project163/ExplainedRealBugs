It applies to the RangeConstraint not the RangeAttribute. RangeAttribute gives the errors as reported:\n\nA step of zero causes a DivideByZeroException. I think this could be replaced by an ArgumentException but is also OK as it stands. It should be clear to the developer.\n\nReversing from and to causes an OverflowException. We should at least throw an Argument exception with an appropriate message. Alternatively, we could make it work in various ways, as shown below.\n\nAdditionally, use of a negative step with from < to will cause an overflow. Again, we should either throw an ArgumentException or make it work.\n\nProposed Resolution (please comment):\n\nA step of zero should give an argument exception. Even though DivideByZero is logical, it takes a moment to figure it out. A message like \"Zero step not allowed\" is much simpler.\n\nAn invalid combination of from, to and step should give an argument exception. An invalid combination occurs if from > to and the step is positive or if from < to and the step is negative.\n\nA valid combination of from, to and step should just work. This will require a bit of change in the code for negative steps.\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nunit/nunit/issues/comments/71884167/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"CharliePoole","id":2678661,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2Nzg2NjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2678661?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole","html_url":"https://github.com/CharliePoole","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":226263240,"node_id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDIyNjI2MzI0MA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nunit/nunit/issues/events/226263240","actor":{"login":"CharliePoole","id":2678661,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2Nzg2NjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2678661?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole","html_url":"https://github.com/CharliePoole","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2015-01-28T18:07:31Z","label":{"name":"pri:normal","color":"0052cc"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":226263469,"node_id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDIyNjI2MzQ2OQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nunit/nunit/issues/events/226263469","actor":{"login":"CharliePoole","id":2678661,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2Nzg2NjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2678661?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole","html_url":"https://github.com/CharliePoole","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2015-01-28T18:07:51Z","label":{"name":"3.0","color":"fef2c0"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":226263572,"node_id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDIyNjI2MzU3Mg==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nunit/nunit/issues/events/226263572","actor":{"login":"CharliePoole","id":2678661,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2Nzg2NjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2678661?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole","html_url":"https://github.com/CharliePoole","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled",

believe this can be done in steps of improvement.  \n1) The documentation for RangeAttribute at http://www.nunit.org/index.php?p=range&r=2.6.3 is a bit overly optimistic \"creates test cases from all possible combinations of the datapoints \".  It should be rephrased, and the limits stated.  It should also state that with wrong parameters you may get these two exceptions.\n2) There is obviously something that always will go wrong, from>to & step negative and to>from and step positive.  Those two can be excluded with a guard clause throwing an argument exception.  \n3) If negative steps need rework of the code, just guard that out for now, and state that in the documentation.  \n4) Since it can operate on floating point numbers, a step may be too small compared to the range it operates on, causing overflow, then this could be attacked later.  I would not prioritize this, as I am fine with an overflow exception as long as it is documented.

was laying around on my hard drive so I decided to clean it up and get it in.\n\nI implemented the three points listed in issue #472:\n1. Zero step gives an ArgumentException\n2. Negative step with from < to or positive with from > to gives an Argument exception.\n3. Other stuff works leaving aside Terje's comment about too small floating steps causing overflow, which is not handled in the current code.\n\nIt would be very easy to make bullet 2 work as well, by simply reversing the sign of the step.
