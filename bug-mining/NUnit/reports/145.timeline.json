When you use `[Values(...)]`, you can just put all the values into the argument, so there's no need for more than one instance of the attribute.\r\n\r\nOTOH, there would be no harm in allowing multiple instances of `ValuesAttribute` as far as I can see, so that's one way to fix the problem.\r\n\r\nAnother easy way out would be to stop deriving `RangeAttribute` from 'ValuesAttribute`. It would cause a very small amount of code duplication and would actually be more consistent with our general approach of making each attribute independent.\r\n\r\nThe key issue is whether multiple parameter data sources can be used on a single parameter, with NUnit combining the values from each source into a single list. The answer is \"yes\" - we already do that. \r\n\r\nI'd call this an easyfix and suggest sombody should just try one of the above approaches.","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nunit/nunit/issues/comments/333888765/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"CharliePoole","id":2678661,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2Nzg2NjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2678661?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole","html_url":"https://github.com/CharliePoole","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":1276278488,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MTI3NjI3ODQ4OA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nunit/nunit/issues/events/1276278488","actor":{"login":"rprouse","id":493828,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5MzgyOA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/493828?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rprouse","html_url":"https://github.com/rprouse","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rprouse/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rprouse/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rprouse/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rprouse/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rprouse/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rprouse/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rprouse/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rprouse/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rprouse/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2017-10-03T15:59:44Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":1276278490,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDEyNzYyNzg0OTA=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nunit/nunit/issues/events/1276278490","actor":{"login":"rprouse","id":493828,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5MzgyOA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/493828?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rprouse","html_url":"https://github.com/rprouse","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rprouse/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rprouse/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rprouse/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rprouse/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rprouse/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rprouse/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rprouse/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rprouse/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rprouse/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2017-10-03T15:59:44Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nunit/nunit/issues/comments/333932026","html_url":"https://github.com/nunit/nunit/issues/2469#issuecomment-333932026","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nunit/nunit/issues/2469","id":333932026,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMzMzkzMjAyNg==","user":{"login":"rprouse","id":493828,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5MzgyOA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/493828?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rprouse","html_url":"https://github.com/rprouse","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rprouse/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rprouse/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rprouse/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rprouse/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rprouse/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rprouse/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rprouse/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rprouse/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rprouse/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-10-03T18:15:16Z","updated_at":"2017-10-03T18:15:16Z","body":"@CharliePoole

`RangeAttribute` derived from `ValuesAttribute`. However, there are certain use cases which apply to the `RangeAttribute`, but not to the `ValuesAttribute`. For example, we may want specify multiple, distinct ranges for a parameter by adding the `RangeAttribute` multiple times, but there isn't really a corresponding use case for the values attribute. We could just specify all the desired values in on attribute.\r\n\r\nThis change updates the `RangeAttribute` to no longer derive from the `ValuesAttribute`. Instead, it now derives from `DataAttribute` and implements `IParameterDataSource`. The  `IParameterDataSource.GetData` method has been implemented in `RangeAttribute` to preserve the behavior of that method in the `ValuesAttribute`. However, certain cases that could not be hit in the `RangeAttribute` (e.g. when the internal data was non-numeric) were removed.\r\n\r\nFixes
