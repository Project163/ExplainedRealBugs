you probably know, TeamCity has pretty decent integration with NUnit, and this year we released a version which integrates with NUnit3 beta. Unfortunately, after recent release of NUnit3 beta 5 our integration is no longer working. While this is understandable risk, when you're providing an integration with beta version of some tool, still we think that some problems could be easily removed. Also beta in the name usually means the tool will not change much, as it is going to be released really soon. Sadly this was not the case here. So, speaking about our problems:\n\n1) First and foremost - NUnit still does not have proper ways to detect its version. We propose to add -version argument or some similar approach. We're aware that nunit-console.exe started without arguments will output version, but what if you change this in the future versions? Is it reliable? Clear approach to versioning will allow vendors, who integrate with the tool, at least to fail gracefully providing user friendly error messages.\n\n2) NUnit 3 beta 5 removed filtering of tests by categories. Corresponding command line arguments were replaced with -where. Given that previous versions of NUnit3 supported these arguments, and we already released a version which works with these versions, we had to workaround this problem with proper using of -where. This sounds like not a big deal, but -where argument has not been supported by previous versions, so now we have to detect the version of the tool, see point 1. \n\n3) Parallel tests are now on by default. For us, it looks like a dangerous approach, which potentially can cause unnecessary problems to users. Users who did not have any problems with performance can face instability problems with tests after upgrade to new NUnit. Moreover, our users (those who run tests on TeamCity build agents) often run tests on virtual machines having 1 core, and for such users it does not make much sense to enable parallelization by default. So they will not benefit from parallelization, but chances are high that they will suffer from instability problems. Currently we have to workaround this problem too, by providing --workers=1 argument by default.\n\n4) nunit-console.exe is now called nunit3-console.exe. Well for us, those who look at the project from outside, this change does not look like justified. Sure there are some incompatibilities with command line and people will have problems with their scripts where they call nunit-console.exe directly. But, some incompatibilities, like removed filtering of tests, could be easily fixed. Others, like parallelization by default, also have issues, and could be re-thought. Also such a change raises questions about future versions. Are we going to see nunit4-console.exe soon? What about minor versions, do you plan to have nunit31-console.exe? Is this now official approach to versioning? Does it mean that people will have to fix their build scripts and CI server configuration, each time when you change executable name?\n\nAnd as a general note, for vendors like us, command line arguments are like API, and as it makes sense to preserve compatibility with API, it also makes sense to preserve it with command line. Note, that we're all for new tools, new features, etc. But changes in API should be justified, and vendors and your users should have clear understanding why they need to fix their tools. And just to make our point more clear. It's not that we insist on backward compatibility, we understand that tool should evolve. It's just that sometimes, backward compatibility can be preserved with relatively small effort. And this small effort can save days or months of work of other people. It would be great if NUnit team paid a little bit more attention to compatibility issues in the future.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nunit/nunit/issues/976/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nunit/nunit/issues/976/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":452960533,"node_id":"MDE3OlJlbmFtZWRUaXRsZUV2ZW50NDUyOTYwNTMz","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nunit/nunit/issues/events/452960533","actor":{"login":"NikolayPianikov","id":11720017,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNzIwMDE3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11720017?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/NikolayPianikov","html_url":"https://github.com/NikolayPianikov","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NikolayPianikov/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NikolayPianikov/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NikolayPianikov/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NikolayPianikov/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NikolayPianikov/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NikolayPianikov/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NikolayPianikov/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NikolayPianikov/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NikolayPianikov/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"renamed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2015-11-03T09:40:27Z","rename":{"from":"User

shot at fixing #978. I'd like @NikolayPianikov to review in addition to at least one of the committers, since he's the one who asked for it. :-)\n\nParticular questions... \n1. Should I further change the format to move the (Debug) in front of the version so the first line reads like...\n   NUnit Console Runner (Debug) 3.0.1234\n2. I did the same thing with NUnitLite. NUnitLite also shows some stuff in parentheses after the version, even in release. If I move the parenthesized stuff for console, I'll do the same for NUnitLite.\n3. In addition to --version | -V I can add some special, long option just for use by CI programs if it's really needed... something like --version-number perhaps.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nunit/nunit/issues/984/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nunit/nunit/issues/984/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":453783742,"node_id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDQ1Mzc4Mzc0Mg==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nunit/nunit/issues/events/453783742","actor":{"login":"CharliePoole","id":2678661,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2Nzg2NjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2678661?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole","html_url":"https://github.com/CharliePoole","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2015-11-03T22:30:23Z","label":{"name":"status:merge","color":"eb6420"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nunit/nunit/issues/comments/153813663","html_url":"https://github.com/nunit/nunit/issues/978#issuecomment-153813663","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nunit/nunit/issues/978","id":153813663,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE1MzgxMzY2Mw==","user":{"login":"NikolayPianikov","id":11720017,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNzIwMDE3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11720017?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/NikolayPianikov","html_url":"https://github.com/NikolayPianikov","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NikolayPianikov/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NikolayPianikov/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NikolayPianikov/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NikolayPianikov/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NikolayPianikov/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NikolayPianikov/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NikolayPianikov/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NikolayPianikov/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NikolayPianikov/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-11-04T18:12:24Z","updated_at":"2015-11-04T18:12:24Z","body":"I think I can parse suggested text.
