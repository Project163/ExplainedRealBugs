It may simply be that we are not finding the interfaces. It would help if you could narrow down a minimal test case for us to work on.\n\nOf course, this will be fixed in NUnit 3.0, so we'll have to retest it in that environment.\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nunit/nunit/issues/comments/59305685/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"CharliePoole","id":2678661,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2Nzg2NjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2678661?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole","html_url":"https://github.com/CharliePoole","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nunit/nunit/issues/comments/59409107","html_url":"https://github.com/nunit/nunit/issues/275#issuecomment-59409107","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nunit/nunit/issues/275","id":59409107,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU5NDA5MTA3","user":{"login":"Joe-McDev","id":4073450,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwNzM0NTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4073450?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Joe-McDev","html_url":"https://github.com/Joe-McDev","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Joe-McDev/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Joe-McDev/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Joe-McDev/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Joe-McDev/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Joe-McDev/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Joe-McDev/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Joe-McDev/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Joe-McDev/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Joe-McDev/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-10-16T18:39:24Z","updated_at":"2015-02-22T21:04:14Z","body":"Here are a few tests that illustrate the issue.

although NUnit passes arguments as objects it doesn't simply call methods on Object in the implementation. We are able to examine the actual type of the objects passed and either cast it (if it's a well-known type) or use reflection. We currently use reflection to solve this problem as shown in my much earlier comment. We are apparently not doing a good enough job in complex cases.\n\nSo, in principal, it's possible to resolve this.
