It's as if the XML output were some strange language, for which we don't have a key. Yet the file as it exists was designed. It contains what it contains as a result of some decisions we (principally I) made. It seems as if there should be a better way to document those decisions, then use that to create an XSD.\n\nThe decisions are embodied in the code, of course, in certain specific places I could point you to. Alternatively, doing some reading, discovered the compact form of RELAX NG. What if I simply provided that?\n\nNone of this resolves the further question I put in a separate thread: How do we get people to review the format? Can we generate web pages that document the meaning of each element in plain English?\n\n---\n\n@rprouse commented on [Fri Oct 24 2014](https://github.com/nunit/nunit/issues/281#issuecomment-60421477)\n\nI did a quick Google search and found [XSDDoc](http://www.filigris.com/docflex-xml/xsddoc/), a freeware tool that generates HTML documents describing the XSD. \n\nThis results look like this, http://www.filigris.com/docflex-xml/xsddoc/examples/html/XMLSchema/PlainDoc.html\n\nThere are probably others, that was just the first freeware program I found.\n\n---\n\n@OsirisTerje commented on [Fri Oct 24 2014](https://github.com/nunit/nunit/issues/281#issuecomment-60427242)\n\nSorry to pop in a bit late here.\n\nI've been doing quite of lot of work with XML/XSD for miscellaneous projects.  My experience is to keep the XML as a transport format (equal to the NUnit 3 idea, afaic see), and the XSD as a representation of the design - as Charlie points out.  What I normally do is to represent the design first as a C# class structure, then generate the XSD from that one, which can be turned into documentation as Rob says with XSDDoc or similars (I have normally used XmlSpy (Oxygen is a similar tool).  The XSD \"may\" have to be tweaked somewhat even from the classes, but normally gives a much better result than generating from the XML.  The XSDs you get from the XML mostly are pretty wild, because there are more degrees of freedom in that direction.  Multiple different XSDs can represent the same XMLs. There are  different xml to xsd tools around, and they all geenrate different xsd's.  The Microsoft XSD tool is one that generates some pretty heavy XSDs, compared to some off the web, which in fact generates better XSDs. \n\nWhen we are satisfied that our XSD schema is the correct representation of the design, I think a tool like Rob pointed to is good enough to generate some documentation.  The details are often not that interesting for review purposes (it becomes quite a lot, I doubt people want to go through all of that.), but the drawings are often easily understandable, and may create some feedback. \n\nI do believe more people are used to XSDs than Relax NG, so - although very simple - I fear the relax ng format will simply confuse more than clarify. \n\nHaving plain English documentation together with an XSD generated drawing, and a sample XML file,  I think would be the best choice. \n\nMy 5 cents .....\n\n---\n\n@CharliePoole commented on [Fri Oct 24 2014](https://github.com/nunit/nunit/issues/281#issuecomment-60429556)\n\nThanks Rob, I'll take a look at this.\n\nCharlie\n\nOn Fri, Oct 24, 2014 at 10:31 AM, Rob Prouse notifications@github.com\nwrote:\n\n> I did a quick Google search and found XSDDoc\n> http://www.filigris.com/docflex-xml/xsddoc/, a freeware tool that\n> generates HTML documents describing the XSD.\n> \n> This results look like this,\n> http://www.filigris.com/docflex-xml/xsddoc/examples/html/XMLSchema/PlainDoc.html\n> \n> There are probably others, that was just the first freeware program I\n> found.\n> \n> —\n> Reply to this email directly or view it on GitHub\n> https://github.com/nunit/nunit/issues/281#issuecomment-60421477.\n\n---\n\n@CharliePoole commented on [Fri Oct 24 2014](https://github.com/nunit/nunit/issues/281#issuecomment-60430893)\n\nHi Terje,\n\nWell, we do have a class structure in the framework of course. Take a look\nat TestResult for example. The XML representation was designed to match\nthat class and is created programmatically. Could we use that as a basis\neven though the implementation does not use standard Xml auto-serialization?\n\nWe also need to have a class representations for the TestResult in the\nrunners (or maybe the engine, for use by the runners). Should we start by\ncreating that class, making it similar to the Framework TestResult?\n\nCharlie\n\nOn Fri, Oct 24, 2014 at 11:13 AM, Terje Sandstrom notifications@github.com\nwrote:\n\n> Sorry to pop in a bit late here.\n> \n> I've been doing quite of lot of work with XML/XSD for miscellaneous\n> projects.

The Xsd requires the properties to be public, so if that is the case it will work.  There are other tools too, but the Xsd is very easy to use. I think it is always good to have a c# class as the de-facto design representation.   I don't think I like XML any more than Charlie, but have been forced to work with it :-)\nFor the Test Result - absolutely!\n\n---\n\n@ravichandranjv commented on [Thu Oct 08 2015](https://github.com/nunit/nunit/issues/281#issuecomment-146711136)\n\nUnable to attach file for some reason.\n\nThe suggestion to use a tool to generate the XSD from the XML file is not so simple because there are some restrictions that need to be taken care of in the output XML file as specifying only certain values to be present for some elements.\n\n@CharliePoole The \"Description\" value is missing in the TestResult format described in the github so the below XSD is still not complete.. \n\nPlus, there are many other maintenance related points like global or local change impact of the schema in future that may impact the XML validation, which should be discussed here. \n\nThis schema I have tested for only two elements - **TestRun** (test-run) and **Environment** but still would like someone to test if the schema validates correctly. \n\nThe schema does not incorporate all the attributes of other elements described in the format at github. If this schema looks like moving in the right direction, I will complete the declarations for the remaining elements. \n\nAssumption: the root element is named TestRun _(Will this cause rewrite to code? Because usage of '-' in schema declaration of element names is not a good practice)_ without the '-' as in the below extracted XML of the actual TestResults.xml. \n\n**The XML**\n\n```\n\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\" standalone=\"no\"?>\n<TestRun xmlns:xsi=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\" xsi:schemaLocation=\"http://www.nunit.org testresults.xsd\">\nid=\"2\" testcasecount=\"2\" total=\"2\" passed=\"2\" failed=\"0\" inconclusive=\"0\" skipped=\"0\" asserts=\"0\" start-time=\"2015-10-07 13:30:06Z\" end-time=\"2015-10-07 13:30:07Z\" >\n<environment nunit-version=\"3.0.5715.30860\" clr-version=\"4.0.30319.42000\" os-version=\"Microsoft Windows NT 6.1.7601 Service Pack 1\" platform=\"Win32NT\" cwd=\"E:\\nunit3_tests\" machine-name=\"JV-PC\" user=\"Jv\" user-domain=\"Jv-PC\" culture=\"en-US\" uiculture=\"en-US\" os-architecture=\"x86\" />\n</TestRun>\n```\n\n**The XSD**\n\n```\n<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n<xsd:schema xmlns:xsd=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema\"\n xmlns:nunit=\"http://www.nunit.org\"\n elementFormDefault=\"unqualified\"\n attributeFormDefault=\"unqualified\">\n<xsd:element name=\"TestRun\" />\n <xsd:complexType name=\"etr\">\n    <xsd:sequence>\n     <xsd:element ref=\"Environment\" minOccurs=\"1\" maxOccurs=\"unbounded\" />\n     <xsd:element ref=\"TestSuite\" minOccurs=\"1\" maxOccurs=\"unbounded\" />\n     <xsd:element ref=\"CommandLine\" minOccurs=\"1\" maxOccurs=\"unbounded\" />\n     <xsd:element ref=\"Settings\" minOccurs=\"1\" maxOccurs=\"unbounded\" />\n     </xsd:sequence>\n </xsd:complexType>\n       <xsd:complexType name=\"tr\">\n        <xsd:attribute name=\"id\" type=\"xsd:int\" use=\"required\"/>\n        <xsd:attribute name=\"testcasecount\" type=\"xsd:int\" use=\"optional\"/>\n        <xsd:attribute name=\"result\" type=\"xsd:string\" use=\"required\"/>\n        <xsd:attribute name=\"total\" type=\"xsd:int\" use=\"optional\"/>\n        <xsd:attribute name=\"passed\" type=\"xsd:int\" use=\"required\"/>\n        <xsd:attribute name=\"failed\" type=\"xsd:int\" use=\"required\"/>\n        <xsd:attribute name=\"inconclusive\" type=\"xsd:int\" use=\"required\"/>\n        <xsd:attribute name=\"skipped\" type=\"xsd:int\" use=\"required\"/>\n        <xsd:attribute name=\"asserts\" type=\"xsd:int\" use=\"required\"/>\n        <xsd:attribute name=\"start-time\" type=\"xsd:date\" use=\"required\"/>\n        <xsd:attribute name=\"end-time\" type=\"xsd:date\" use=\"required\"/>\n        <xsd:attribute name=\"duration\" type=\"xsd:decimal\" use=\"required\"/>\n    </xsd:complexType> \n            <xsd:element name=\"Environment\"> \n        <xsd:complexType>\n            <xsd:attribute name=\"nunit-version\" type=\"xsd:string\" use=\"required\"/>\n            <xsd:attribute name=\"clr-version\" type=\"xsd:string\" use=\"required\"/>\n            <xsd:attribute name=\"os-version\" type=\"xsd:string\" use=\"required\"/>\n           <xsd:attribute name=\"platform\" type=\"xsd:string\" use=\"optional\"/>\n           <xsd:attribute name=\"cwd\" type=\"xsd:string\" use=\"required\"/>\n           <xsd:attribute name=\"machine-name\" type=\"xsd:string\" use=\"optional\"/>\n           <xsd:attribute name=\"user\" type=\"xsd:string\" use=\"required\"/>\n           <xsd:attribute name=\"user-domain\" type=\"xsd:string\" use=\"required\"/>\n           <xsd:attribute name=\"culture\" type=\"xsd:string\" use=\"required\"/>\n           <xsd:attribute name=\"uiculture\" type=\"xsd:string\" use=\"required\"/>\n           <xsd:attribute name=\"os-architecture\" type=\"xsd:string\" use=\"required\"/>\n        </xsd:complexType> \n            </xsd:element>\n    <xsd:element name=\"TestSuite\" type=\"xsd:string\"/>    \n    <xsd:element name=\"CommandLine\" type=\"xsd:string\"/>    \n    <xsd:element name=\"Settings\" type=\"xsd:string\"/>    \n</xsd:schema>\n\n```\n\n---\n\n@CharliePoole commented on [Thu Oct 08 2015](https://github.com/nunit/nunit/issues/281#issuecomment-146721452)\n\nAs you see from the milestone assigned to it, we are not working on this right now, so I'll only give a few brief comments. I don't really want to try to create an XSD until after we settle on the actual file content. I think a \"friendlier\" format will be better for people to comment on.\n\nThe file content is being worked as issue #254 and the current documentation of the file comment is at https://github.com/nunit/nunit/wiki/Test-Result-XML-Format We are waiting for comments!!!\n\nSince you have gone to this trouble, however, here are a few comments to your comments. :-)\n- Generating an XSD schema from the file: We are not doing that.\n- Description is not part of the file because it's a property rather than an attribute.\n- Use of hyphen in element names: The NUnit 2.x result format has used hyphens since the year 2000. It has never appeared to cause any problems. Is there a reason you say it is not a good practice? Changing all the elements would be a significant programming change that we would be unlikely to do at this late date.\n\nAs I explained above, issue #254 is a pre-requisite to this one. We do not want to have to work on the XSD more than once and we don't actually need it to release NUnit 3.0. That's why it's in the milestone of 3.0-Extras, that is, individual bits to be worked on after release.\n\n---\n\n@ravichandranjv commented on [Thu Oct 08 2015](https://github.com/nunit/nunit/issues/281#issuecomment-146732533)\n\nHi Charlie, Thanks for spending some time on XML. :) \n- Use of hyphens as not a good practice is simply in the context of the XSD element naming conventions, which follows the upper case camel convention. \n\nYou have mentioned above, \"some people like to validate against a XSD..\", which is the reason why I posted the XSD. \n\nBy having the XSD, people can use tools to generate a schema diagram from the XSD file, which can also serve as documentation, along with comments next to the schema boxes in the diagram plus, validate the XML file, which may be important for people who may want to further work through the XML using Xpath or XSL.\n\nHaving a **beta** XSD, now, however broken or incomplete, will serve its purpose in gaining some insight into the type of XML that should be generated from code. \n\nFor instance, in issue [#254](https://github.com/nunit/nunit/issues/254), the issue you have highlighted under `<environment>` gets resolved if we approach the XML creation through XSD standards, which says that if you wish to have multiple values in a data set for the same attribute/property of an object then use elements, so the two different or more runtime versions can be accommodated under `<environment>` itself rather than at the assembly level, which should gain  favor because it is an OO approach, as per your stated preference there -.to have a semi-colon separated set of values under a single field.\n\nThe reason I mention it here and not in the comments of [#254](https://github.com/nunit/nunit/issues/254) is because it is related more to XSD (as and when it may get created) because values, too, can be/get constrained in XSD and if ignored, can cause errors at the time of validation, post-XML generation causing problems for report generation of the test results. \n\nSo, even if it is not priority now, having a glimpse of the kind of XSD that may be needed later helps so as to reduce any chance of a (https://github.com/nunit/nunit/issues/850), ie. a schema validation related XML error that has nothing to do with NUnit usage, causing tests to fail.\n\n---\n\n@CharliePoole commented on [Thu Oct 08 2015](https://github.com/nunit/nunit/issues/281#issuecomment-146766375)\n\nThanks for your comments. We will keep them in mind when we work on the\nXSD. NUnit itself does not require or make any use of an XSD, so it is an\nextra that we will provide for those who need it only after the release.\n\nWe have been working on the new format for the result file for over a year\nand it is already being created. The documentation I created reflects what\nwe are actually doing. It's important to us to have this reviewed. I\nunderstand that you are suggesting a different process, but we have a\nprocess already under way. We are stretched too thin to add any new tasks\nright now. If you would like to help, please stick to the approach we are\ntaking and make comments either on issue #254 or through the developer list.\n\nOn Thu, Oct 8, 2015 at 6:32 PM, Ravichandran Jv notifications@github.com\nwrote:\n\n> Hi Charlie, Thanks for spending some time on XML. :)\n> - Use of hyphens as not a good practice is simply in the context of\n>   the XSD element naming conventions, which follows the upper case camel\n>   convention.\n> \n> You have mentioned above, \"some people like to validate against a XSD..\",\n> which is the reason why I posted the XSD.\n> \n> By having the XSD, people can use tools to generate a schema diagram from\n> the XSD file, which can also serve as documentation, along with comments\n> next to the schema boxes in the diagram plus, validate the XML file, which\n> may be important for people who may want to further work through the XML\n> using Xpath or XSL.\n> \n> Having a _beta_ XSD, now, however broken or incomplete, will serve its\n> purpose in gaining some insight into the type of XML that should be\n> generated from code.\n> \n> For instance, in issue #254 https://github.com/nunit/nunit/issues/254,\n> the issue you have highlighted under <environment> gets resolved if we\n> approach the XML creation through XSD standards, which says that if you\n> wish to have multiple values in a data set for the same attribute/property\n> of an object then use elements, so the two different or more runtime\n> versions can be accommodated under <environment> itself rather than at\n> the assembly level, which should gain favor because it is an OO approach,\n> as per your stated preference there -.to have a semi-colon separated set of\n> values under a single field.\n> \n> The reason I mention it here and not in the comments of #254\n> https://github.com/nunit/nunit/issues/254 is because it is related more\n> to XSD (as and when it may get created) because values, too, can be/get\n> constrained in XSD and if ignored, can cause errors at the time of\n> validation, post-XML generation causing problems for report generation of\n> the test results.\n> \n> So, even if it is not priority now, having a glimpse of the kind of XSD\n> that may be needed later helps so as to reduce any chance of a nasty code\n> change just so that a schema validation error that has nothing to with the\n> NUnit user, causes the tests to fail as in issue 850\n> https://github.com/nunit/nunit/issues/850.\n> \n> —\n> Reply to this email directly or view it on GitHub\n> https://github.com/nunit/nunit/issues/281#issuecomment-146732533.\n\n---\n\n@ravichandranjv commented on [Fri Oct 09 2015](https://github.com/nunit/nunit/issues/281#issuecomment-146799414)\n\nHi Charlie,\n\nI am not suggesting any process change nor proposing any new tasks just highlighted some points related to XSD. \n\nI am happy to go by your judgement/direction. \n\n---\n\n@stashell commented on [Wed Jul 20 2016](https://github.com/nunit/nunit/issues/281#issuecomment-233900751)\n\nHello everyone. We are writing tool which will parse also NUnit3 test results and thus I have a few questions regarding the XSD scheme and stability of the test-results XML format design.\n- Any news about the \"existence\" of XSD for NUnit3 test-results ?\n- How stable is the XML test-results design currently ? \n- Do you expect many changes in the further 3.x versions ?  \n\nThank you.\n\nPatrik\n\n---\n\n@rprouse commented on [Wed Jul 20 2016](https://github.com/nunit/nunit/issues/281#issuecomment-233963997)\n\n@stashell there is currently no XSD for the test-results format, but the design is fairly stable. The XML format is part of the API between the NUnit Engine and runners including 3rd Party runners, so we are careful to not change it unless there are bugs. Any changes tend to be minor and additive. For example, we might add a new attribute or occasionally a new child element, but that is rare.\n\nTo get a good example of all of the combinations, I would suggest creating a mock test suite that has a variety of passing, failing, ignored, explicit and errors. Errors are tests that throw non-NUnit assert exceptions. I would also use properties and categories on tests and include test output using the `TestContext.Write` methods.\n\n---\n\n@CharliePoole commented on [Wed Jul 20 2016](https://github.com/nunit/nunit/issues/281#issuecomment-233992742)\n\n@stashell In addition, read the docs! https://github.com/nunit/docs/wiki/Test-Result-XML-Format\n\n@rprouse Maybe we should try to get this done.
