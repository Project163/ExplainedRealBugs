Still I would expect to get `AssertionException` because logically the actual value doesn't match expectation and it's a requirement mismatch which means that potentially it should be handled by test-runner in a special way.\n","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nunit/nunit/issues/comments/179871984/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"Robot1que","id":1783090,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3ODMwOTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1783090?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Robot1que","html_url":"https://github.com/Robot1que","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Robot1que/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Robot1que/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Robot1que/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Robot1que/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Robot1que/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Robot1que/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Robot1que/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Robot1que/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Robot1que/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nunit/nunit/issues/comments/179902410","html_url":"https://github.com/nunit/nunit/issues/1171#issuecomment-179902410","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nunit/nunit/issues/1171","id":179902410,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE3OTkwMjQxMA==","user":{"login":"jhamm","id":98657,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk4NjU3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/98657?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhamm","html_url":"https://github.com/jhamm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhamm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhamm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhamm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhamm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhamm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhamm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhamm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhamm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhamm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-02-04T15:33:25Z","updated_at":"2016-02-04T15:33:25Z","body":"My expectation is that Is.Empty and Is.Not.Empty would behave the same as `actual == string.Empty` and `actual != string.Empty`.

Compare these two statements:\n\n``` C#\nAssert.That(null, Is.EqualTo(string.Empty));\nAssert.IsEmpty(null);\n```\n\nThe first matches the behavior of the `==` operator, just as the name of the constraint would suggest. The second is basically it's own thing, with it's own definition and it's own constraints. That's not to say we can't discuss what that definition ought to be, but just that it has nothing to do with equality.\n\nEmptyConstraint is basically an adapter that selects one of three constraints: EmptyStringConstraint, EmptyDirectoryConstraint, EmptyCollectionConstraint. Of the three, only the first one is even close to an equality test. When designing the behavior of EmptyConstraint, I decided that it's argument should meet the needs of all the alternatives. Null definitely does not work for directories or collections. In case it's not obvious why, those two have to throw an exception because, if they simply failed, NotConstraint(EmptyDirectoryConstraint()) would succeed, possibly leading one to think that they have a non-empty directory when what they have is a null. This rule of throwing rather than failing is followed pretty uniformly throughout NUnit.\n\nI grant that it is a reasonable option to allow a null **string** to be handled correctly. But we can't uniformly accept null for all of the three alternatives for which Empty is used. Note that we don't know which of the three actual constraints will be used until after we have an actual value.\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nunit/nunit/issues/comments/179959569/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"CharliePoole","id":2678661,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2Nzg2NjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2678661?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole","html_url":"https://github.com/CharliePoole","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nunit/nunit/issues/comments/180014058","html_url":"https://github.com/nunit/nunit/issues/1171#issuecomment-180014058","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nunit/nunit/issues/1171","id":180014058,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE4MDAxNDA1OA==","user":{"login":"jhamm","id":98657,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk4NjU3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/98657?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhamm","html_url":"https://github.com/jhamm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhamm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhamm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhamm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhamm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhamm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhamm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhamm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhamm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhamm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-02-04T19:29:25Z","updated_at":"2016-02-04T19:29:25Z","body":"I see you point.

I need to review the code again, but I think it is close to that now isn't it?\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nunit/nunit/issues/comments/180039419/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"rprouse","id":493828,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5MzgyOA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/493828?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rprouse","html_url":"https://github.com/rprouse","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rprouse/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rprouse/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rprouse/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rprouse/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rprouse/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rprouse/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rprouse/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rprouse/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rprouse/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":539766615,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50NTM5NzY2NjE1","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nunit/nunit/issues/events/539766615","actor":{"login":"CharliePoole","id":2678661,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2Nzg2NjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2678661?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole","html_url":"https://github.com/CharliePoole","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2016-02-04T20:37:08Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
