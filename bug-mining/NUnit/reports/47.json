data values fed to the RangeAttribute can trigger a DivideByZero exception and/or an OverflowException. These values have been pointed out by the Smart Unit Tests feature from Visual Studio 2015, and an image with the data values is attached.\n\nThe DivideByZero may happen by the user entering 0 as a step value.\nThe OverflowException is more serious as it highlights an implicit constraint saying “to > from” that is not stated anywhere. There should there be any need for that.\n![exceptions](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/9894334/5914081/b1bd6452-a5a3-11e4-82a2-ca760b9dac52.jpg).\n\nThese issues are seen for all the RangeAttribute overloads.\nPlease let me know if you need any further information.\n\nPratap Lakshman\n","closed_by":{"login":"CharliePoole","id":2678661,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2Nzg2NjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2678661?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole","html_url":"https://github.com/CharliePoole","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nunit/nunit/issues/472/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nunit/nunit/issues/472/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
