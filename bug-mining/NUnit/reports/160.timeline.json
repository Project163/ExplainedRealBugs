great, thanks @DaiMichael!\r\n\r\nFrom a quick look at the code on my phone however, it looks like we may be in ‘breaking change’ territory here.\r\n\r\nDictionaryContainsKeyConstraint currently uses NUnitEqualityComparer, rather than the default comparer for a type as a dictionary would. NUnitEqualityComparer has various additions that allow certain types which wouldn’t compar equal with normal .NET Equals() to ‘be equal’.\r\n\r\nGiven the nature of the constraint, my opinion right now is that we should make the change so this constraint always uses the comparer of the dictionary - despite the fact that may break some existing users tests. It’s probably worth waiting for others on @nunit/framework-team to chime in however, on what they think the best way to take this is!\r\n\r\nLike I say, I’ve only looked on my phone, so this may all

\r\n\r\nSo having a bit more of a look, at first stab I would look to check to see if the passed in Dictionary has a `EqualityComparer<TKey>.Default`. If this is the case we can use the current 'NUnitEqualityComparer' else we use the one defined in the Dictionary, which in theory should be the desired one.\r\n\r\nI haven't see if this would break any tests yet but it should only change behaviour when the use case requires it?! Famous last words obviously.
