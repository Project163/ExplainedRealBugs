is a much more general problem than the example initially suggested. NUnit 2.6.4 allows a Theory to combine data provided by a parameter attribute with data supplied by a datapoint. NUnit 3.0 is not allowing that - the data must be entirely supplied by attributes or entirely by datapoints.\n\nTo complicate things, when I initially wrote a test for this, it passed! Turns out that the running of tests at the second level using TestBuilder uses a slightly different implementation. So this issue is not seen by the unit tests at

4.7.2.\r\n\r\nSituation:\r\nA test with a bool? argument has all tests variations added, despite explicit [TestCase] values. This not only causes unwanted tests to be generated, but also duplicates where the parameters are the same as the explicit ones.\r\n\r\nObserved:\r\nA single test theory with a bool? argument and two [TestCase] attributes generates 5 tests (2 are ignored for being duplicates), leaving a total of 3 runnable tests.\r\n\r\nExpected:\r\nOnly the two explicit tests should be generated.\r\n\r\nThe documentation listed at https://github.com/nunit/docs/wiki/Theory-Attribute states:\r\n\r\n> For boolean and enum arguments, NUnit can supply the data without any action by the user. All possible values are supplied to the argument. This feature is disabled if the user supplies any values for the argument.\r\n\r\nIt seems this may not work for nullable values.\r\n\r\nThe xUnit framework generates the expected test count.\r\n\r\nHere's the test that shows the problem:\r\n```\r\n    public class Tests\r\n    {\r\n        [Theory]\r\n        [TestCase(true)]\r\n        [TestCase(null)]\r\n        public void test_theory_should_not_have_false_parameter(bool? unicode)\r\n        {\r\n            Assert.That(unicode, Is.Not.False);\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\nHere's the discovery output from Visual Studio:\r\n```\r\n[11/18/2019 5:29:54 PM Informational] ------ Discover test started ------\r\n[11/18/2019 5:29:56 PM Informational] NUnit Adapter 3.11.0.0: Test discovery starting\r\n[11/18/2019 5:29:56 PM Informational] NUnit Adapter 3.11.0.0: Test discovery complete\r\n[11/18/2019 5:29:56 PM Warning] A test with the same name 'Tests.Tests.test_theory_should_not_have_false_parameter(True)' already exists.

Looking at https://github.com/nunit/nunit/blob/bd45c2e2caae85c530fdd2e9962df382a8fbb863/src/NUnitFramework/framework/Internal/Builders/DatapointProvider.cs the statement you quote is only for data supplied via DatapointAttribute and DatapointSourceAttribute.\r\n\r\nThe page you found also states \r\n> In addition to the Datapoint and Datapoints attributes, it is possible to use any of the approaches for supplying data that are recognized on normal parameterized tests. We suggest that this capability not be overused, since it runs counter to the distinction between a test based on examples and a theory. However, it may be useful in order to guarantee that a specific test case is included.\r\n\r\nSo I think the best solution to this problem would be to improve the documentation rather than possibly breaking peoples code.\n\n---\n\n@Gwindalmir commented on [Tue Nov 19 2019](https://github.com/nunit/nunit3-vs-adapter/issues/678#issuecomment-555671307)\n\n> it is possible to use any of the approaches for supplying data that are recognized on normal parameterized tests\r\n\r\nThis means TestCase, ValueSource, etc, as documented here: https://github.com/nunit/docs/wiki/Parameterized-Tests\r\n\r\nSo the documentation is at least contradicting itself.\r\n\r\nI do understand the necessity to maintain compatibility, but I've noticed NUnit tends to do that to a fault, as I've noticed bad behavior building but never gets fixed because of compatibility.\r\n\r\nPersonally, I don't like automatic parameter generation at all. I don't think it's safe or reliable, as demonstrated by this behavior.\r\n\r\nAnyway, a _safe_ solution could be to add an optional argument to TheoryAttribute to disable automatic test generation, such as:\r\n```\r\n[Theory(autogenerate = false)]\r\n```\r\nOr a test settings file, though that's less convenient.\n\n---\n\n@OsirisTerje commented on [Wed Nov 20 2019](https://github.com/nunit/nunit3-vs-adapter/issues/678#issuecomment-556093376)\n\nAs @mikkelbu says, this issue belongs in the NUnit repository, so I'll move it there.\n\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nunit/nunit/issues/3430/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nunit/nunit/issues/3430/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
