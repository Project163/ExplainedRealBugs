For this release, we will fill in some gaps to consolidate those gains.\r\n\r\nKey Planned Features:\r\n* Allow multiple engines to co-exist, with differing sets of extensions installed.\r\n* Increase use of extensions.\r\n* Provide a way for NUnit to install it's own extensions.\r\n* Provide a way for users to manage the extensions.\r\n* Separate OneTimeSetUp and OneTimeTearDown work items.\r\n* Implement a generalized dependency mechanism between work items.\r\n* Implement parallel test case execution.\r\n* Implement one of the proposed test dependency or ordering mechanisms.\r\n* Integrate the Xamarin runners with NUnit in some way to be determined\r\n","creator":{"login":"CharliePoole","id":2678661,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2Nzg2NjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2678661?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole","html_url":"https://github.com/CharliePoole","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"open_issues":0,"closed_issues":49,"state":"closed","created_at":"2015-06-20T12:08:30Z","updated_at":"2016-05-21T15:22:49Z","due_on":"2016-02-29T08:00:00Z","closed_at":"2016-03-05T22:29:57Z"},"comments":43,"created_at":"2015-01-18T04:00:41Z","updated_at":"2016-03-05T17:09:36Z","closed_at":"2016-01-20T00:51:13Z","author_association":"NONE","type":null,"active_lock_reason":null,"sub_issues_summary":{"total":0,"completed":0,"percent_completed":0},"issue_dependencies_summary":{"blocked_by":0,"total_blocked_by":0,"blocking":0,"total_blocking":0},"body":"All assertions that take TestDelegate should have correlating methods that take an asynchronous equivalent (Task AsyncTestDelegate()). E.g., Assert.Throws(TestDelegate) should have a matching Assert.ThrowsAsync(AsyncTestDelegate) or Assert.Throws(AsyncTestDelegate). This would enable this kind of usage:\n\n```\nawait Assert.ThrowsAsync<Exception>(async () =>\n{\n  await Task.Yield();\n  throw new Exception();\n});\n```\n\nAlso, some synchronous assertion code has outdated code; e.g., Assert.Throws will try to create an AsyncInvocationRegion that will never succeed, since AIR (correctly) rejects async void methods and TestDelegate returns void. Ideally, AIR should only be used when executing the [Test] methods themselves, not within any other code.\n","closed_by":{"login":"rprouse","id":493828,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5MzgyOA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/493828?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rprouse","html_url":"https://github.com/rprouse","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rprouse/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rprouse/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rprouse/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rprouse/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rprouse/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rprouse/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rprouse/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rprouse/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rprouse/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nunit/nunit/issues/464/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nunit/nunit/issues/464/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
