I use `params` to make writing test cases easier:\n\n``` csharp\n[Test]\n[TestCase()]\n[TestCase(1)] // <-- this test case misbehaves\n[TestCase(1, 2, 3)]\npublic void TestMethod(params int[] array) {\n    Assert.That(array.Length, Is.Not.EqualTo(1)); // Fail arrays of length 1 (see below)\n}\n```\n\nHowever, the middle test case above behaves oddly. To make the test case stand more out here, I've made the test fail only for that test case.\n\nWhen running the tests inside VS using NUnit Adapter 3.0.8.0 the test shows up as follows:\n<img width=\"212\" src=\"https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1230950/13225067/89844c90-d98b-11e5-92af-ae61cb1384ea.png\">\nAs oppose to the others that show up as `TestMethod()`and `TestMethod(1, 2, 3)`, the middle test case is given as an array: `TestMethod(System.Int32[])`. I would expect it to show `TestMethod(1)`.\n\nIf I use ReSharper to run the tests (which I normally do), the test case shows up twice:\n<img width=\"420\" src=\"https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1230950/13225192/178034f0-d98c-11e5-9ac2-ea06234342d0.png\">\nOne time as a failed test `TestMethod(System.Int32[])`, and one time as a pending test `TestMethod(1)`. It seems to write the right thing for the pending test, but not the failed one.\n","closed_by":{"login":"CharliePoole","id":2678661,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2Nzg2NjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2678661?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole","html_url":"https://github.com/CharliePoole","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nunit/nunit/issues/1282/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nunit/nunit/issues/1282/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
