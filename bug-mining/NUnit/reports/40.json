been using the nunit-console Alpha 3 for some time and deiced to upgrade to the Beta 1. However when I did I've found that my App.config for my tests is no longer being read and any calls to ConfigurationManager.AppSettings return an empty string / null. Is there something that changed which would cause this. I did check the TestContext working directory and output directory, both of which show the correct location (under both Alpha 3 and Beta 1).\n\nI've tried the following configurations below:\n\nEmpty String Returned:\nnunit.framework (Alpha 3 and Beta 1) with nunit-console (Beta 1)\n\nProper Value Returned:\nnunit.framework (Alpha 3 and Beta 1) with nunit-console (Alpha 3)\n\nExample Code:\n\npublic class ScratchTest\n    {\n\n```\n    [Test]\n    public void MyTest()\n    {\n        TestContext.Out.WriteLine(ConfigurationManager.AppSettings.Get(\"Endpoint\"));\n    }\n }\n```\n","closed_by":{"login":"CharliePoole","id":2678661,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2Nzg2NjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2678661?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole","html_url":"https://github.com/CharliePoole","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nunit/nunit/issues/646/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nunit/nunit/issues/646/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
