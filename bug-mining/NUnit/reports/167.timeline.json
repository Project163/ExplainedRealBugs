So the current code only works for tuples with elements that are compared using value equality.\r\n\r\nThe problem can probably be solved by moving `EquatablesComparer` to after `TupleComparer` and `ValueTupleComparer` in the list of `IChainComparer`  in `NUnitEqualityComparer`, but it requires some more thought than just a quick brainstorm from my side.","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nunit/nunit/issues/comments/432136470/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"mikkelbu","id":1007631,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMDc2MzE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1007631?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkelbu","html_url":"https://github.com/mikkelbu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkelbu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkelbu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkelbu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkelbu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkelbu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkelbu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkelbu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkelbu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkelbu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":1919603757,"node_id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDE5MTk2MDM3NTc=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nunit/nunit/issues/events/1919603757","actor":{"login":"mikkelbu","id":1007631,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMDc2MzE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1007631?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkelbu","html_url":"https://github.com/mikkelbu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkelbu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkelbu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkelbu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkelbu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkelbu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkelbu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkelbu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkelbu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkelbu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-10-23T07:54:34Z","label":{"name":"is:bug","color":"fc2929"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":1921481947,"node_id":"MDEzOkFzc2lnbmVkRXZlbnQxOTIxNDgxOTQ3","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nunit/nunit/issues/events/1921481947","actor":{"login":"mikkelbu","id":1007631,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMDc2MzE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1007631?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkelbu","html_url":"https://github.com/mikkelbu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkelbu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkelbu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkelbu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkelbu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkelbu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkelbu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkelbu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkelbu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkelbu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"assigned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-10-23T19:18:33Z","assignee":{"login":"mikkelbu","id":1007631,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMDc2MzE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1007631?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkelbu","html_url":"https://github.com/mikkelbu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkelbu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkelbu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkelbu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkelbu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkelbu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkelbu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkelbu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkelbu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkelbu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":1921819492,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDE5MjE4MTk0OTI=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nunit/nunit/issues/events/1921819492","actor":{"login":"mikkelbu","id":1007631,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMDc2MzE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1007631?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkelbu","html_url":"https://github.com/mikkelb
