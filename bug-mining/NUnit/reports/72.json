fixing #515 so that MacOSX is correctly returned when running on a Mac, the three tests fail because they are using the directory separator char to determine the platform and setting it to Linux where

These should be fixed properly when we have more time.\n\n```\n1) Failed : NUnit.Framework.Attributes.ApplyToTestTests.PlatformAttributeRunsTest\n  Expected: Runnable\n  But was:  Skipped\nat NUnit.Framework.Attributes.ApplyToTestTests.PlatformAttributeRunsTest () [0x00044] in /Users/rob/src/nunit/src/NUnitFramework/tests/Attributes/ApplyToTestTests.cs:363\n\n2) Failed : NUnit.Framework.Attributes.TestCaseAttributeTests.CanExcludePlatform\n  Expected: Skipped\n  But was:  Runnable\nat NUnit.Framework.Attributes.TestCaseAttributeTests.CanExcludePlatform () [0x00068] in /Users/rob/src/nunit/src/NUnitFramework/tests/Attributes/TestCaseAttributeTests.cs:313\n\n3) Failed : NUnit.Framework.Attributes.TestCaseAttributeTests.CanIncludePlatform\n  Expected: Runnable\n  But was:  Skipped\nat NUnit.Framework.Attributes.TestCaseAttributeTests.CanIncludePlatform () [0x00068] in /Users/rob/src/nunit/src/NUnitFramework/tests/Attributes/TestCaseAttributeTests.cs:291\n```\n","closed_by":{"login":"rprouse","id":493828,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5MzgyOA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/493828?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rprouse","html_url":"https://github.com/rprouse","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rprouse/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rprouse/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rprouse/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rprouse/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rprouse/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rprouse/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rprouse/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rprouse/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rprouse/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nunit/nunit/issues/869/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nunit/nunit/issues/869/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
