#859 was merged and closed, I started wondering why changing the order of the reports did not affect the tests of the console runner. The test that was supposed to do that was not actualy working. In fixing it, I ended up updating the XML that we use to test the console runner, so that this push is actually more work than the original fix!\n\nWe need to make this a bit more robust than it is, since updating the xml is tedious and the tests are quite fragile with respect to changes in the XML output. I'm  creating another issue for that.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nunit/nunit/issues/906/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nunit/nunit/issues/906/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":439144632,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDQzOTE0NDYzMg==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nunit/nunit/issues/events/439144632","actor":{"login":"rprouse","id":493828,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5MzgyOA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/493828?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rprouse","html_url":"https://github.com/rprouse","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rprouse/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rprouse/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rprouse/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rprouse/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rprouse/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rprouse/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rprouse/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rprouse/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rprouse/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"efcf7f261f658858b4c049e98abfdddb94b91288","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nunit/nunit/commits/efcf7f261f658858b4c049e98abfdddb94b91288","created_at":"2015-10-19T13:52:51Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
