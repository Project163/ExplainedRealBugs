ran into this while debugging a problem with a test class that contained the following declaration:\n\nstatic readonly string MockAssembly Path =\n    Path.Combine(TestContext.CurrentContext.TestDirectory, \"mock-nunit-assembly.exe\");\n\nThis declaration worked OK in one test class but caused a second one to simply disappear from the discovered tests.  It turned out that the second class contained a method marked with TestCaseSource, with the data defined in the same class.\n\nThe result of this insidious combination is that TestContext.CurrentContext.TestDirectory is executed at a time when it is not expected to be executed: when no tests are being run. That means that no TestExecutionContext has been set up and the the statement throws a null reference exception while tests are being loaded. In my case, there was no indication of a problem, other than  the fact that the entire fixture was missing from the displayed tests.\n\nThis should be investigated and a check introduced so that attempting to access the TestContext at a time when no test is being executed causes a prominent error message.\n","closed_by":{"login":"CharliePoole","id":2678661,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2Nzg2NjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2678661?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole","html_url":"https://github.com/CharliePoole","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nunit/nunit/issues/538/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nunit/nunit/issues/538/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
