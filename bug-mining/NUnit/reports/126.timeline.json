the 3.4 release, we plan to improve the engine to allow it to run tests targeting platforms and .NET frameworks that are currently only supported through NUnitLite based runners. This includes platforms like .NET Core and Universal Windows. Ideally, this will also improve the way we run tests on mobile platforms like Android and iOS.\r\n\r\nSince these features will be a part of the engine, any runners using the engine will automatically support the new platforms.\r\n\r\nIn addition, we will be fixing issues and completing enhancements in the backlog in priority order.\r\n\r\nWe are planning on maintaining a quarterly release cycle and plan on releasing 3.4 at the end of June.","creator":{"login":"CharliePoole","id":2678661,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2Nzg2NjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2678661?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole","html_url":"https://github.com/CharliePoole","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"open_issues":0,"closed_issues":54,"state":"closed","created_at":"2015-12-04T19:46:32Z","updated_at":"2016-06-27T02:50:32Z","due_on":"2016-06-30T07:00:00Z","closed_at":"2016-06-25T16:58:54Z"},"comments":37,"created_at":"2016-04-19T23:22:58Z","updated_at":"2016-04-25T00:59:48Z","closed_at":"2016-04-22T10:48:37Z","author_association":"MEMBER","type":null,"active_lock_reason":null,"sub_issues_summary":{"total":0,"completed":0,"percent_completed":0},"issue_dependencies_summary":{"blocked_by":0,"total_blocked_by":0,"blocking":0,"total_blocking":0},"repository":{"id":13692183,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMzY5MjE4Mw==","name":"nunit","full_name":"nunit/nunit","private":false,"owner":{"login":"nunit","id":2678858,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjI2Nzg4NTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2678858?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nunit","html_url":"https://github.com/nunit","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nunit/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nunit/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nunit/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nunit/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nunit/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nunit/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nunit/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nunit/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nunit/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/nunit/nunit","description":"NUnit

Adding a child result changes the collection of child results, the resultstate and possibly message and the various totals that are maintained (passed, failed, etc.). So this method definitely needs a lock of it's own and would need it even if the collection itself were thread-safe.\n\nCan you take a look and tell me what other info I can  give you so as to drive a
