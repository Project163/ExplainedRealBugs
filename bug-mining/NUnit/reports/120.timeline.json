has various parameterised arguments, which make various special conversions to adjust parameters to match method signatures, to allow invocation via reflection. The key ones I'm thinking of are `[TestCase()]`, `[TestCaseSource()]`, `[TestFixture()]` and `[TestFixtureSource()]`.\r\n\r\nSupport for params and optional arguments between these attributes is inconsistent. Over the years, this has raised various issues:\r\nhttps://github.com/nunit/nunit/issues/1281 (open)\r\nhttps://github.com/nunit/nunit/issues/1883 (open)\r\nhttps://github.com/nunit/nunit/issues/1459 (open)\r\nhttps://github.com/nunit/nunit/issues/1640\r\nhttps://github.com/nunit/nunit/issues/1278\r\nhttps://github.com/nunit/nunit/issues/1282\r\nhttps://github.com/nunit/nunit/issues/257\r\n\r\nWe've talked in a couple of places ([link 1](https://github.com/nunit/nunit/pull/2104), [link 2](https://github.com/nunit/nunit/issues/1281), [link 3](https://github.com/nunit/nunit/pull/1850)) about harmonising this functionality, and having a single utility class, which resolves parameters passed to attributes, and ensures they are handled in a standard manner across all attributes. As I remember - this was something we agreed to go ahead with - @Yarmonov started on a PR in https://github.com/nunit/nunit/pull/2104. (This seems to have gone stale, unfortunately. Will check in on it shortly.) This would mean that the params keyword and optional arguments would be handled in a standard fashion across all of these attributes, meaning no unexpected surprises for the end-user. \r\n\r\nI wanted to create a master issue for this whole idea - as some of the existing open issues are tagged easyfix - and I didn't want anyone to end up implementing any more solutions individually, when we actually want to be sharing the existing functionality between attributes. If @nunit/framework-team agree - I'd like to close the open issues above, and use this as a single issue to reflect the overall plan.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nunit/nunit/issues/2268/reactions","total_count":4,"+1":4,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nunit/nunit/issues/2268/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
