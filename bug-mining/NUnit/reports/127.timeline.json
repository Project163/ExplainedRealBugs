I was able to get it working by adding a check to the TestCaseSourceAttribute.BuildFrom method:\n\n``` csharp\n        public IEnumerable<TestMethod> BuildFrom(IMethodInfo method, Test suite)\n        {\n            // added:\n            if (TestExecutionContext.CurrentContext != null && TestExecutionContext.CurrentContext.CurrentTest == null)\n                TestExecutionContext.CurrentContext.CurrentTest = suite;\n\n            foreach (TestCaseParameters parms in GetTestCasesFor(method))\n                yield return _builder.BuildTestMethod(method, suite, parms);\n        }\n```\n\nThe rest of the tests ran just fine. I also ran cake with the TestAll target with no issues. I am not sure if this would impact anything else though.\n\nFrom what I can see, this seems to work without modifying the API so it should be ok with backward compatibility.\n","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nunit/nunit/issues/comments/180681715/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"jhamm","id":98657,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk4NjU3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/98657?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhamm","html_url":"https://github.com/jhamm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhamm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhamm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhamm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhamm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhamm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhamm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhamm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhamm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhamm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nunit/nunit/issues/comments/180694566","html_url":"https://github.com/nunit/nunit/issues/1241#issuecomment-180694566","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nunit/nunit/issues/1241","id":180694566,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE4MDY5NDU2Ng==","user":{"login":"CharliePoole","id":2678661,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2Nzg2NjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2678661?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole","html_url":"https://github.com/CharliePoole","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-02-06T05:32:14Z","updated_at":"2016-02-06T05:32:14Z","body":"@jhamm It's tempting but a bit of a hack, since TestExecutionContext.Current is not really supposed to exist when tests are not being run.
