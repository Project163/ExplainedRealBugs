This change\r\nenables several constraints and other features in the .NET Standard builds that\r\nweren't available in portable like Path and Directory based asserts.\r\n\r\nThe AssertionHelper class has been deprecated because it is seldom used and has\r\nnot received any of the updates that Asserts and Constraints receive.
