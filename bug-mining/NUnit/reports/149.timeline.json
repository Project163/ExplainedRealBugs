Since it's parameterized, the two instances will run in parallel with one another.\r\n\r\nThe `[NonParallelizable]` and `[Parallelizable]` attributes on test 1 are in conflict with one another. The test should be marked as non-runnable. Since it isn't, that may be a bug - see below. My guess is that one of the two attributes is taking precedence over the other.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, the `[Parallelizable(ParallelScope.Fixtures)]` attribute should cause test 2 to be invalid. Again, that may be a bug. In this case, the attribute will have no effect at all, since there are no fixtures \"included\" in the test method.\r\n\r\nI see you are running an older copy of the console runner. Is it possible you are also running an older copy of the framework? The code that checks for invalid combinations is fairly recent.\r\n\r\nAs for what you want to achieve with multiple fixtures... here's a diagram of what I understand.\r\n\r\n```C#\r\n[TestFixture(\"data\"), Parallelizable]\r\npublic class A\r\n{\r\n    [NonParallelizable]\r\n    public void aa()\r\n\r\n   ...\r\n}\r\n\r\n[TestFixture(\"data\"), Parallelizable]\r\npublic class B\r\n{\r\n   ...\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf `data` provides three sets of arguments, we will have six fixture instances running potentially in parallel. I'll assume that all the methods, except for `aa` have `[Parallelizable]` (You could alternatively use `ParallelScope.Self | ParallelScope.Children` on the fixtures, with the same result)\r\n\r\nAssuming we are running with at least six cores and we start in parallel mode, all six fixtures would be initialized in parallel (created and one time setup run). In addition, all the methods except for `aa` would continue to run in parallel. Onetime teardown for the instances of fixture B would also complete.\r\n\r\nEventually, there would be no more tests able to run in parallel. The dispatcher would then switch to its non-parallel mode (we call it a change of shift) and run `aa`. It would continue to run any other non-parallel tests until there were no more to run. Then it would switch back to parallel mode to run the teardowns for fixture A.\r\n\r\nThere is no interference among these tests unless you have coded them to somehow interfere with one another. If that's the case, then they can't be run in parallel at all.\r\n\r\nI hope this explains things a bit better.","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nunit/nunit/issues/comments/322859501/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"CharliePoole","id":2678661,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2Nzg2NjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2678661?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole","html_url":"https://github.com/CharliePoole","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nunit/nunit/issues/comments/322885798","html_url":"https://github.com/nunit/nunit/issues/2364#issuecomment-322885798","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nunit/nunit/issues/2364","id":322885798,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMyMjg4NTc5OA==","user":{"login":"evancam","id":5949036,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5NDkwMzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5949036?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/evancam","html_url":"https://github.com/evancam","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/evancam/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/evancam/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/evancam/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/evancam/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/evancam/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/evancam/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/evancam/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/evancam/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/evancam/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-08-16T20:14:58Z","updated_at":"2017-08-16T20:14:58Z","body":"As I have said previously, I am the most recent version of the framework, v3.8.0-dev-04267.

Sometimes it will fully pass, sometimes it will only run 3 out of 4 tests. Sometimes it will hang and throw the following error:\r\n```\r\n System.NullReferenceException: Object reference not set to an instance of an object.\r\n   at NUnit.Framework.Internal.Execution.WorkItemQueue.get_IsEmpty()\r\n   at NUnit.Framework.Internal.Execution.WorkShift.get_HasWork()\r\n   at NUnit.Framework.Internal.Execution.ParallelWorkItemDispatcher.StartNextShift()\r\n   at NUnit.Framework.Internal.Execution.ParallelWorkItemDispatcher.OnEndOfShift(Object sender, EventArgs ea)\r\n   at NUnit.Framework.Internal.Execution.WorkShift.EndShift()\r\n   at NUnit.Framework.Internal.Execution.WorkShift.<StartWorkers>b__26_1(TestWorker s, WorkItem ea)\r\n   at NUnit.Framework.Internal.Execution.TestWorker.TestWorkerThreadProc()\r\n   at System.Threading.ThreadHelper.ThreadStart_Context(Object state)\r\n   at System.Threading.ExecutionContext.RunInternal(ExecutionContext executionContext, ContextCallback callback, Object state, Boolean preserveSyncCtx)\r\n   at System.Threading.ExecutionContext.Run(ExecutionContext executionContext, ContextCallback callback, Object state, Boolean preserveSyncCtx)\r\n   at System.Threading.ExecutionContext.Run(ExecutionContext executionContext, ContextCallback callback, Object state)\r\n   at System.Threading.ThreadHelper.ThreadStart()\r\n   at NUnit.Framework.Internal.Execution.WorkItemQueue.get_IsEmpty()\r\n   at NUnit.Framework.Internal.Execution.WorkShift.get_HasWork()\r\n   at NUnit.Framework.Internal.Execution.ParallelWorkItemDispatcher.StartNextShift()\r\n   at NUnit.Framework.Internal.Execution.ParallelWorkItemDispatcher.OnEndOfShift(Object sender, EventArgs ea)\r\n   at NUnit.Framework.Internal.Execution.WorkShift.EndShift()\r\n   at NUnit.Framework.Internal.Execution.WorkShift.<StartWorkers>b__26_1(TestWorker s, WorkItem ea)\r\n   at NUnit.Framework.Internal.Execution.TestWorker.TestWorkerThreadProc()\r\n   at System.Threading.ThreadHelper.ThreadStart_Context(Object state)\r\n   at System.Threading.ExecutionContext.RunInternal(ExecutionContext executionContext, ContextCallback callback, Object state, Boolean preserveSyncCtx)\r\n   at System.Threading.ExecutionContext.Run(ExecutionContext executionContext, ContextCallback callback, Object state, Boolean preserveSyncCtx)\r\n   at System.Threading.ExecutionContext.Run(ExecutionContext executionContext, ContextCallback callback, Object state)\r\n   at System.Threading.ThreadHelper.ThreadStart()\r\n```\r\nAs for the multiple fixtures, All of what you said is fine, except it is essential `aa` is not  `NonParallelizable`. `aa` is the longest test out of the entire suite of tests, so forcing it to be `NonParallelizable` would increase the duration of the test run significantly. I don't want to create another separate test fixture, `C`,  for `aa` as then I am duplicating a significant amount of code from `A`. I'd rather not create a base fixture that both `C` and `A` derive from to solve this problem, as that would make this significantly different from what has already been implemented elsewhere in the current structure.
