use of extensions.\r\n* Provide a way for NUnit to install it's own extensions.\r\n* Provide a way for users to manage the extensions.\r\n* Separate OneTimeSetUp and OneTimeTearDown work items.\r\n* Implement a generalized dependency mechanism between work items.\r\n* Implement parallel test case execution.\r\n* Implement one of the proposed test dependency or ordering mechanisms.\r\n* Integrate
