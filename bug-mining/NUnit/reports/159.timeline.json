are complications here that could lead us deep in to the building of constraint expressions. However, I can see two pretty simple solutions.\r\n\r\n1. `Throws.TypeOf` could return an `ExceptionTypeConstraint` rather than an `ExactTypeConstraint`. That will fix the exact case reported but will not fix either  `Throws.Exception.TypeOf` or `Throws.InstanceOf`, which display the same problem. It would, however, be an improvement.\r\n\r\n2. We could modify `ConstraintResult.WriteActualValueTo` so it works just like the corresponding method in `ExceptionTypeConstraintResult` when the actual value is an exception. This is a wide-reaching change so we would have to check to see if there are any problems. I can't think of a situation where the actual value would be an exception and we __wouldn't__ want to see message and stack trace, but there could be one. If we take this approach, we could consider marking `ExceptionTypeConstraint` as obsolete, since it will no longer be necessary.\r\n\r\nI'm taking my name off this and marking it as an easy fix. I recommend trying approach 2 first.","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nunit/nunit/issues/comments/299526213/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"CharliePoole","id":2678661,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2Nzg2NjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2678661?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole","html_url":"https://github.com/CharliePoole","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":1070947342,"node_id":"MDE1OlVuYXNzaWduZWRFdmVudDEwNzA5NDczNDI=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nunit/nunit/issues/events/1070947342","actor":{"login":"CharliePoole","id":2678661,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2Nzg2NjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2678661?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole","html_url":"https://github.com/CharliePoole","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"unassigned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2017-05-05T17:29:07Z","assignee":{"login":"CharliePoole","id":2678661,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2Nzg2NjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2678661?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole","html_url":"https://github.com/CharliePoole","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":1070947854,"node_id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDEwNzA5NDc4NTQ=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nunit/nunit/issues/events/1070947854","actor":{"login":"CharliePoole","id":2678661,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2Nzg2NjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2678661?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole","html_url":"https://github.com/CharliePoole","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2017-05-05T17:29:26Z","label":{"name":"easyfix","color":"009800"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nunit/nunit/issues/comments/303439493","html_url":"https://github.com/nunit/nunit/issues/2146#issuecomment-303439493","issue_url":"https://api.github

In case of `ExactTypeConstraint`, which `Throws.TypeOf` uses, the actual value is a type, and that makes sense, since it's a type constraint. I see no simple and decent way of modifying `ConstraintResult.WriteActualValueTo` so that works similar to `ExceptionTypeConstraintResult.WriteActualValueTo`. @CharliePoole please tell me if I miss, or misunderstand something.

thought I had a solution to this, but as already mentioned above, the fundamental problem here is that `Throws.TypeOf()` returns `ExactTypeConstraint`, rather than `ExceptionTypeConstraint`.\r\n\r\nThis is a problem because it forces `ThrowsConstraint.ApplyTo()` to return an instance of `ThrowsConstraintResult`, with the base result set to the caught exceptions type (rather than the actual exception). As mentioned before, this makes sense for a `TypeConstraint`.\r\n\r\nI think a potential fix to this issue is to introduce a new `ExceptionConstraintExpression`, who's `TypeOf()` methods return `ExceptionTypeConstraint`, rather than `ExactTypeConstraint`. (This may well be a dumb idea, as it's the first time I've looked at the code, so I don't really understand the architecture / internals.)","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nunit/nunit/issues/comments/335033514/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"BlakeWills","id":8128694,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxMjg2OTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8128694?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BlakeWills","html_url":"https://github.com/BlakeWills","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BlakeWills/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BlakeWills/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BlakeWills/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BlakeWills/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BlakeWills/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BlakeWills/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BlakeWills/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BlakeWills/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BlakeWills/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nunit/nunit/issues/comments/335223162","html_url":"https://github.com/nunit/nunit/issues/2146#issuecomment-335223162","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nunit/nunit/issues/2146","id":335223162,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMzNTIyMzE2Mg==","user":{"login":"rprouse","id":493828,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5MzgyOA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/493828?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rprouse","html_url":"https://github.com/rprouse","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rprouse/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rprouse/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rprouse/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rprouse/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rprouse/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rprouse/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rprouse/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rprouse/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rprouse/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-10-09T17:19:04Z","updated_at":"2017-10-09T17:19:04Z","body":"@BlakeWills I am going to assign this to @mikkelbu to work with you on this issue.\r\n\r\nAs for your analysis, I would need to look at the code, but your analysis and possible solution sound like a good start.","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nunit/nunit/issues/comments/335223162/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"rprouse","id":493828,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5MzgyOA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/493828?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rprouse","html_url":"https://github.com/rprouse","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rprouse/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rprouse/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rprouse/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rprouse/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rprouse/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rprouse/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rprouse/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rprouse/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rprouse/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}}]
