you for your fast responses; I checked the \"image runtime version\" using ILDASM on Windows, looking for \"Metadata Version\" as per http://blogs.msdn.com/b/suzcook/archive/2003/06/20/57191.aspx, however she says that the ImageRuntimeVersion of an Assembly may not be the actual required one.\n\nILDASM says the Metadata Version is 4.0.30319.\n\nI also noticed that MonoDevelop did not update the DLL files (namely, nunit.framework.dll) in the output directory, so it kept an old version - 2.6.2 from net-40 directory. Once manually cleared the directory and rebuilt the solution, now the nunit.framework.dll version is in sync with the console runner, 3.0.5790, and is taken from the net-45 directory, and the problem disappears: the tests run correctly.\n\nI don't think it is still a bug, when the assembly under test is linked to an old version (targeting a different framework, net-40) and the runner is new (and it crashes), so I think this issue can be closed - still, if you want to investigate on this problem, I'll try to help

I am going to leave this open. We shouldn't be crashing, we should be displaying an error. If this is not a mono issue, but just an older framework in the bin directory issue, then it could happen more often.\n\nI am mainly thinking of the scenario where people build multiple projects into the same bin directory. If some test projects have been upgraded, but not others, the framework could be any version. Of course, this is a mistake on the developers part as all dependencies for the solution should be at the same version, but ideally we wouldn't crash.\n\nI am going to leave the confirm label on this to see if it is a more general non-Mono problem, but drop the priority to low since it is a user error and move it out to post 3.0. @CharliePoole, if you think we should look at this earlier, move it back :smile:
