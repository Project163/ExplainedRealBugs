commented on [Thu Oct 26 2017](https://github.com/nunit/nunit-console/issues/305)\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n\r\n- Unit test `SuccessfulStdErrorTest` has code: `System.Console.Error.WriteLine(\"errorout\");`\r\n\r\n- ITestEventListener receives the following events:\r\n```\r\n<start-test id=\"0-1001\" parentId=\"0-1000\" name=\"SuccessfulStdErrorTest\" fullname=\"Foo.Tests.UnitTests1.SuccessfulStdErrorTest\" type=\"TestMethod\" />\r\n\r\n<test-output stream=\"Error\" testname=\"Foo.Tests.UnitTests1.SuccessfulStdErrorTest\"><![CDATA[errorout\r\n]]></test-output>\r\n```\r\n\r\n`test-output` has no information id/parentId about a target test and there is no way to attach this error output. It is important to note that these events could be received from different tests simultaneously.\r\n\r\nSee this [sample](https://github.com/nunit/nunit-console/files/1418559/sample.zip)\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"jnm2","id":8040367,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgwNDAzNjc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8040367?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jnm2","html_url":"https://github.com/jnm2","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jnm2/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jnm2/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jnm2/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jnm2/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jnm2/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jnm2/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jnm2/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jnm2/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jnm2/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nunit/nunit/issues/2516/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nunit/nunit/issues/2516/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
