Unfortunately, the TestContext references it.\nNUnit itself never serializes TextContext, so the problem only arises when\nthe test attempts to create its own app domain.\n\nSolving this will take some thought. We don't want TestExecutionContext to\nbe serializable, since that would require making a lot of internal classes\nserializable as well. We might make it an MBR object. Alternatively, we\ncould simply have TestContext cache values from the execution context and\neliminate the reference.\n\nOn Mon, Jul 21, 2014 at 4:04 PM, Paweł Adamowicz
