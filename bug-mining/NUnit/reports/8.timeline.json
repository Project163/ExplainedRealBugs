It simply allows you to run tests that you wouldn't otherwise be able to run correctly, i.e. if you're using an async API in your test code and awaiting something, your are forced to make the test async and optionally return a Task. Because it was quite surprising that by simply using await in your test NUnit would not run it correctly we introduced a feature which removed the surprise. Now if you use await the test runs correctly because NUnit is acting as a boundary which waits for your test to complete before deciding whether it ran successfully or not.\n\nReturning a Task is conceptually a different thing. You are not forced by the compiler to return a Task from your test, so if your intent is to make NUnit await that Task you should simply await it in your test code, in any other case I don't see why you would want to return a Task in the first place. Task is simply a type, the fact that it is reused in the async/await implementation is just a unrelated concept in this context. If we treated Task differently, then you could argue that we should treat Thread differently as well, for example Join it, rather than an EvenWaitHandle, for example Reset it. You get the point.\n\nThe difference between a method returning a Task and an async method returning a Task is the async part. The MSIL is different for one, and from a more practical perspective unless NUnit handled async methods properly there would be no way to run your test successfully, whereas in your case you do have a way to run your test successfully by either awaiting you Task or doing nothing with it, depending on what you're trying to achieve.\n\nThe reason I sympathise with your point on the other hand is because I also enjoy using libraries that can figure out my intent and can even support more scenarios than what would be reasonable to support. The downside of this approach is that you risk to make your library less intuitive, because if you support one crazy scenario it becomes quite likely that you forgot to support another crazy scenario that some user would consider just as reasonable as the first one.

And I think that's what matters here. If you want to write a method that represents an asynchronous operation - talking in general here, not about unit tests -, you're going to write a method returning a Task in most cases. Whether that method is implemented using the `async` keyword, or returns a running operation started using `Task.Run` (and similar means), or returns a pre-computed value using `Task.FromResult` doesn't really matter. What you know is that you can await that method.\n\nI'm proposing that NUnit follows what the framework already uses: `Task` is simply the asynchronous counterpart of `void`. Async void methods aren't really async from a _caller_ perspective, there is no way to know when it's really finished, they're basically used only in \"fire and forget\" scenarios, and task returning methods should be the preferred way. I avoid async void in my production code, and write my unit tests the same way. I'd even argue than the fact that NUnit supports waiting for async void methods is the \"crazy scenario\" here: you can't do that \"normally\", unless you're using the clever `SynchronizationContext` trick everywhere, that's why I'm avoiding async void methods like the plague.\n\nThat being said, I totally understand what you are reluctant to make to such changes: NUnit shouldn't support every scenario. I can totally live (and already living with) with the current approach, but I think you should consider that the changes I'm advocating are mainly for coherence: since any method returning a `Task` can be awaited, I believe that NUnit should do the same. Take my first post as an example: the two tests are completely semantically equivalent, and I can await the returned task (or choose not to) when I'm the caller. However, when NUnit is the caller, it awaits only based on implementation details, which shouldn't matter.\n","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nunit/nunit/issues/comments/29953214/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"MrJul","id":1623034,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MjMwMzQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1623034?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrJul","html_url":"https://github.com/MrJul","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrJul/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrJul/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrJul/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrJul/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrJul/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrJul/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrJul/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrJul/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrJul/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nunit/nunit/issues/comments/29955256","html_url":"https://github.com/nunit/nunit/issues/63#issuecomment-29955256","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nunit/nunit/issues/63","id":29955256,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI5OTU1MjU2","user":{"login":"simoneb","id":20181,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwMTgx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20181?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/simoneb","html_url":"https://github.com/simoneb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/simoneb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/simoneb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/simoneb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/simoneb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/simoneb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/simoneb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/simoneb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/simoneb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/simoneb/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2013-12-06T01:09:13Z","updated_at":"2013-12-06T01:09:13Z","body":"I appreciate we have slightly different views, and in fact introducing this change would probably not have any unintended consequences and we could quite easily do it.

We're simply not drawing it at the same place. In the best of the world, anything that implement the new awaitable pattern, with a `GetAwaiter()` method returning a `INotifyCompletionObject` could be handled, since that's what the compiler does. In a more pragmatic world, `Task` is used most of the time, is well known with well defined semantics, and more importantly is now the preferred way to define asynchronous operations.\n\nImplementing support for `Thread` or `IAsyncResult` five years ago may have made sense. Nowadays, you can almost consider them as deprecated for new development, at least that's the message Microsoft wants to give. These two classes aren't even present anymore in .NET for WinRT. In the \"classic\" framework, a method such as `Stream.BeginRead` returning an `IAsyncResult` is now just a wrapper for the task-based `Stream.ReadAsync`.\n\nWell, I think you got my point, your view may differ and I won't bother you anymore with this after this post. In the end, I'm just an user, NUnit is great as it is, and any async test can be written as a synchronous one with a simple `Wait()` call so support for those aren't really primordial. I simply like that the libraries I use on a daily basis share the current .NET tools (read framework/compiler/language)

Let's go back to the original error report. You indicated that the test returning Task was ignored. Did you really mean ignored? (I expect NotRunnable)\n\nAdditionally, are you running NUnit 3.0 or 2.6.3?

We're both right of course.\n\nThe key question here is whether the change you are asking for will be\nharmful to any existing tests.
