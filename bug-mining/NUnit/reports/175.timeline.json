Version:** 3.13.3 (latest stable as of this posting)\r\n\r\n**Goal:** I am attempting to repeatedly check a method to Assert that it eventually throws an Exception within a certain amount of time. (Specifically, looking to get a 401 back from a webcall after a delete, where the deletion does not always occur instantly).\r\n\r\n**Approach:** I would like to do this by using a constraint of the form `Throws.<...>.After.<...>`.\r\n\r\n**Issue:** Unfortunately, the combination of these constraints results in the test failing due to the thrown Exception, rather than passing due to the Assert that the Exception will be thrown. It appears that that nunit gets snagged on the Delayed constraint, never making it to the Throws constraint to see that the Exception was actually the expected outcome.\r\n\r\nNote that `.After` works fine with other constraints, such as `Is`. Similarly, `Throws` works fine when I leave off the `.After` constraint, simply checking that the method throws the first time it is called. \r\n\r\n**Example:** The commented-out counting code was implemented to simulate the repeated calls, e.g., 4 calls before the expected error is thrown. But the presence or absence of that code has no impact on the outcome.\r\n```\r\n    [Test]\r\n    public void TestThrowsAfter()\r\n    {\r\n      Assert.That(() => ThrowingMethod(), Throws.TypeOf<ArgumentException>().After(5).Seconds.PollEvery(500));\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    private int count;\r\n    private int ThrowingMethod()\r\n    {\r\n      Thread.Sleep(50);\r\n      // Uncommenting this code has no effect on the outcome:\r\n      //if (count < 5)\r\n      //{\r\n      //  return ++count;\r\n      //}\r\n      throw new ArgumentException(\"test\");\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Example Result:** When I run the above, I get a test failure, with the following readout:\r\n```\r\nSystem.ArgumentException : test\r\n   at Tests.ThrowingMethod() in <throw line>\r\n   at Tests.<TestThrowsAfter>b__48_0() in <Assert.That line>\r\n   at NUnit.Framework.Constraints.DelayedConstraint.InvokeDelegate[T](ActualValueDelegate`1 del)\r\n   at NUnit.Framework.Constraints.DelayedConstraint.ApplyTo[TActual](ActualValueDelegate`1 del)\r\n   at NUnit.Framework.Assert.That[TActual](ActualValueDelegate`1 del, IResolveConstraint expr, String message, Object[] args)\r\n   at NUnit.Framework.Assert.That[TActual](ActualValueDelegate`1 del, IResolveConstraint expr)\r\n   at Tests.TestThrowsAfter() in <Assert.That
