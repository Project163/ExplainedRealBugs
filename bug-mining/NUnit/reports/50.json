discovered this working on RandomAttribute and spent a lot of time thinking it was my new code causing the problem, since the error didn't actually point to the place where it occured. For that reason, I think this is a high priority bug.\n\nHere's some code:\n\n```\n    [Test]\n    public void ExampleTest()\n    {\n        short val = 7;\n        short min = 5;\n        int max = 10;\n        Assert.That(val, Is.InRange(min, max));\n    }\n```\n\nIt results in an ArgumentException with the message \"Object must be of type Int16\"\n\nSome experimentation is needed with different types. It may only apply to fixed point numbers.\n","closed_by":{"login":"CharliePoole","id":2678661,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2Nzg2NjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2678661?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole","html_url":"https://github.com/CharliePoole","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nunit/nunit/issues/718/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nunit/nunit/issues/718/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
