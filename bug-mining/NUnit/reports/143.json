All,\r\n\r\nIn trying to port some NUnit tests to .NET Core I've found that methods with `[OneTimeSetUp]`, `[SetUp]`, `[TearDown]`, and `[OneTimeTearDown]` attributes from a base class are not being called on `[Test]`s in derived classes. This is only occurring when running against .NET Core, for all versions of NUnit I've tried (3.7.1 and up). \r\n\r\nApologies if this has been documented elsewhere (I believe I checked thoroughly...) or if I'm doing something silly here!\r\n\r\nTo reproduce:\r\n`csproj` file:\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk\">\r\n\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>netcoreapp2.0</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n\r\n  <!--<PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>net46</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <PropertyGroup Condition=\"'$(TargetFramework)' == 'net46'\">\r\n    <TargetFrameworkIdentifier>.NETFramework</TargetFrameworkIdentifier>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>-->\r\n\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"Microsoft.NET.Test.Sdk\" Version=\"15.3.0\" />\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"NUnit\" Version=\"3.8.1\" />\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"NUnit3TestAdapter\" Version=\"3.8.0\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nTest:\r\n```csharp\r\npublic class BaseClass\r\n    {\r\n        // These methods all get called when running the \"Inheritance\" test in .NET framework,\r\n        // but not in .NET Core\r\n        [OneTimeSetUp]\r\n        protected void OneTimeSetUp()\r\n        {\r\n            Console.WriteLine(\"OneTimeSetUp\");\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        [SetUp]\r\n        protected void SetUp()\r\n        {\r\n            Console.WriteLine(\"SetUp\");\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        [TearDown]\r\n        protected void TearDown()\r\n        {\r\n            Console.WriteLine(\"TearDown\");\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        [OneTimeTearDown]\r\n        protected void OneTimeTearDown()\r\n        {\r\n            Console.WriteLine(\"OneTimeTearDown\");\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        public class DerivedClass : BaseClass\r\n        {\r\n            [Test]\r\n            public void Inheritance()\r\n            {\r\n                Console.WriteLine(\"Test\");\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\nEDIT: use XML, not C#, formatting for `csproj`","closed_by":{"login":"ChrisMaddock","id":4837132,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4MzcxMzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4837132?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChrisMaddock","html_url":"https://github.com/ChrisMaddock","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChrisMaddock/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChrisMaddock/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChrisMaddock/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChrisMaddock/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChrisMaddock/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChrisMaddock/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChrisMaddock/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChrisMaddock/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChrisMaddock/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nunit/nunit/issues/2448/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nunit/nunit/issues/2448/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
