resolving issue #929 we renamed nunit-console to nunit3-console. We did it pretty fast and not everyone is 100% happy. We have had some discussion but it's still hanging.\n\nI'm creating this issue to force us to make a decision about the name before RC2, which is due out in a few days. I don't want to make the change past RC2, so a decision is critical.\n\nPros  and Cons of the original rename: (Feel free to edit this comment with more of them)\n\nPRO \nIt's a different program, with differnet options, let's give it a different name.\nIt will help some tools.\nWe have renamed some nuget packages, so we should rename the exe.\n\nCON\nCommand-line users are used to typing nunit-console and know how to set the path.\nIt will hurt some tools.\nWe have renamed some nuget packages, so that should be sufficient.\nWe have not renamed other things, like nunitlite or the framework.\n\nIf I were doing this for me, based on personal preference, I'd revoke the change. We know that @NikolayPianikov was bothered by it. Feel free to include personal preferences.\n\nIf you don't care, I'm taking that as an indication we should not have changed it.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nunit/nunit/issues/987/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nunit/nunit/issues/987/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":751083140,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDc1MTA4MzE0MA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nunit/nunit/issues/events/751083140","actor":{"login":"ChrisMaddock","id":4837132,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4MzcxMzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4837132?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChrisMaddock","html_url":"https://github.com/ChrisMaddock","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChrisMaddock/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChrisMaddock/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChrisMaddock/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChrisMaddock/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChrisMaddock/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChrisMaddock/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChrisMaddock/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChrisMaddock/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChrisMaddock/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"cde0e83154096dc9b09104d7e7af6441a6391513","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ChrisMaddock/nunit/commits/cde0e83154096dc9b09104d7e7af6441a6391513","created_at":"2016-08-10T09:51:21Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":751083147,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDc1MTA4MzE0Nw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nunit/nunit/issues/events/751083147","actor":{"login":"ChrisMaddock","id":4837132,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4MzcxMzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4837132?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChrisMaddock","html_url":"https://github.com/ChrisMaddock","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChrisMaddock/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChrisMaddock/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChrisMaddock/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChrisMaddock/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChrisMaddock/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChrisMaddock/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChrisMaddock/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChrisMaddock/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChrisMaddock/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"1dcf3d24ae76f321c9b982d285cb191ad4db0f04","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ChrisMaddock/nunit/commits/1dcf3d24ae76f321c9b982d285cb191ad4db0f04","created_at":"2016-08-10T09:51:21Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
