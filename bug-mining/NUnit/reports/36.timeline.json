When the concrete input found, we add relevant test and delete \"Repeat\" from original test.\n\n### Testing \"multi-threaded\" code.\n\nTo be sure if a concrete code works in multi-threaded (multi-process) mode, I implement test and permanently execute the test with Repeat(<enough big number>).\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nunit/nunit/issues/comments/81725615/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"rprouse","id":493828,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5MzgyOA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/493828?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rprouse","html_url":"https://github.com/rprouse","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rprouse/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rprouse/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rprouse/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rprouse/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rprouse/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rprouse/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rprouse/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rprouse/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rprouse/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nunit/nunit/issues/comments/81757610","html_url":"https://github.com/nunit/nunit/issues/478#issuecomment-81757610","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nunit/nunit/issues/478","id":81757610,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDgxNzU3NjEw","user":{"login":"CharliePoole","id":2678661,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2Nzg2NjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2678661?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole","html_url":"https://github.com/CharliePoole","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-03-16T15:55:03Z","updated_at":"2015-04-12T18:32:12Z","body":"I'll add to the use cases an additional use I had originally envisioned, which is similar to the \"random\" use case but a bit broader.

That is, an attribute that causes repetition unless the test fails.\n\nSome other people are talking about Repeat as if it worked in the reverse way, that is, to keep repeating until the test passes! I call this RetryAttribute and I think that's the one to worry about a little. If your tests only pass after you retry them several times, then I'd say there's something wrong.\n\nFinally, so-called ThreadedRepeat is an entirely different animal. There's no repetition at all, but you have several instances of the test running in parallel. We're not doing that for 3.0, but it's listed for a future release.\n\nNote that both Repeat and Retry are actually _required_ to run all tests in sequence, so they will have to run on the same thread.\n\nIf we want to talk about Retry, it should be on a separate issue - in fact we may have one either here or on Launchpad.\n\nGiven all the use cases, I'd be inclined to put Repeat into the first beta if the underpinnings are still there as I think they are.
