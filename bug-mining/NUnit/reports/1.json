am trying to write an Assert that tests that a TreeNode has a number of children and a specific text.\n\nWhat I was doing was something like: \n\n``` csharp\n\nAssert.That(mapper.Node, \nHas.Property(\"Text\").EqualTo(\"SomeText\")\n& Has.Property(\"Nodes\").Matches(Is.Unique.And.Count.EqualTo(2)));\n\n```\n\n```\nExpected: property Text equal to \"SomeName\" and property Nodes equal to 2\n  But was:  < <TreeNode: Node 6bc35351-14d1-469a-9439-f3afb56a0c85>, <TreeNode: Node 15d8f7f7-aecd-4f15-9d5a-f291f8e6ee33> >\n```\n\nNotice how the output it seems to disregard Unique and Count and just jumb to the \"Equal\" constraint, and obviously 2 and a list of nodes are not equal.\n\nSimplified fully self-contained example without dependencies to windows forms etc:\n\n``` csharp\nusing System.Collections.Generic;\nusing System.Linq;\nusing NUnit.Framework;\n\nnamespace NUnitStuff\n{\n    [TestFixture]\n    public class Test\n    {\n        [Test]\n        public void Bug()\n        {\n            var unit = new Unit();\n\n            Assert.That(unit,\n                Has.Property(\"Name\").EqualTo(\"Unit\")\n                & Has.Property(\"Items\").Matches(Has.Count.EqualTo(10)));\n        }\n\n    }\n\n    public class Unit\n    {\n        public List<int> Items { get; private set; }\n        public string Name { get; private set; }\n        public Unit()\n        {\n            Name = \"Unit\";\n            Items = new List<int>(Enumerable.Range(0,10));\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\n```\nExpected: property Name equal to \"Unit\" and property Items equal to 10\n  But was:  < 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 >\n```\n","closed_by":{"login":"CharliePoole","id":2678661,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2Nzg2NjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2678661?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole","html_url":"https://github.com/CharliePoole","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nunit/nunit/issues/62/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nunit/nunit/issues/62/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
