nunit3 console runner --where option does not return an error on an invalid selection string.\n\nFor a while I was trying to use the following selection string:\n--where \"cat == Pri1 AND cat != WIP\"\n\nThis selection string was not properly filtering out \"WIP\" tests and was instead just running all \"Pri1\" tests. After rereading the documentation it occurred to me that \"AND\" (with all capital letters) is not a valid logical operator in this context. Switching this out for \"&&\" or \"and\" results in the expected filtering.\n\nMy usage of the --where option is technically incorrect, but with this incorrect usage I would have expected an error claiming that my string was not of a valid format. Instead the console runner silently continued with test execution with an incorrect subset of tests.\n\nIt would also be cool if \"AND\" (and other similar operators with capital letters) was valid, but that's just my opinion.\n","closed_by":{"login":"rprouse","id":493828,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5MzgyOA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/493828?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rprouse","html_url":"https://github.com/rprouse","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rprouse/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rprouse/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rprouse/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rprouse/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rprouse/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rprouse/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rprouse/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rprouse/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rprouse/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nunit/nunit/issues/1055/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nunit/nunit/issues/1055/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
