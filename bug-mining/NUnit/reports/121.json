We implemented this method to throw an exception in debug builds so our unit tests catch cases where the object is passed to methods like `string.Format` that implicitly call `ToString()`.\n\nWhen switching from NUnit 2 to NUnit 3, many of our tests started to fail. This is caused by the fact that in NUnit 3 `Assert.AreNotSame` and `Assert.AreSame` call `ToString()` on the object _even when the assertion succeeds_. In addition to causing unnecessary performance overhead during testing, this is notably problematic for our code.
