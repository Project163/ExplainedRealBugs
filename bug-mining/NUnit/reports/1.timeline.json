Matches(new MyNewConstraint())\n\nNUnit has no special fluent syntax for the newly created MyNewConstraint, so we need some general way to incorporate it in the syntax and Matches is designed for that job.\n\nUnfortunately, the syntax also accepts a general expression like Has.Count.EqualTo(5). Examining the code, I can see that Matches really expects a \"resolved constraint\" but the expression provided is \"unresolved.\" What these terms mean is that Matches gets an EqualConstraint with some prefix operators attached that have not yet been resolved. As a result, the Property(\"Count\") operation is never resolved.\n\nSince the syntax allows this, we should make it work. On the other hand, it's not a high priority since there are so many simpler syntactic options that will work.\n\nGuidance for whoever (including myself) works on this:\n\nWe need to look closely at how the ConstraintExpression and ConstraintBuilder Append methods work. There are places in the code where Constraint is used and others where IConstraint is used. This may need to be adjusted and we may want to call Resolve on constrains passed as arguments to one or both of these Append methods.\n\nCharlie\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nunit/nunit/issues/comments/29866908/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"CharliePoole","id":2678661,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2Nzg2NjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2678661?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole","html_url":"https://github.com/CharliePoole","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":79752362,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50Nzk3NTIzNjI=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nunit/nunit/issues/events/79752362","actor":{"login":"CharliePoole","id":2678661,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2Nzg2NjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2678661?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole","html_url":"https://github.com/CharliePoole","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":"cbf15073997c647f89c911dc8b021a72447d8a56","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nunit/nunit/commits/cbf15073997c647f89c911dc8b021a72447d8a56","created_at":"2013-12-05T03:31:05Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nunit/nunit/issues/comments/29868950","html_url":"https://github.com/nunit/nunit/issues/62#issuecomment-29868950","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nunit/nunit/issues/62","id":29868950,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI5ODY4OTUw","user":{"login":"CharliePoole","id":2678661,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2Nzg2NjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2678661?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole","html_url":"https://github.com/CharliePoole","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2013-12-05T03:32:14Z","updated_at":"2013-12-05T03:32:14Z","body":"Turns out I noticed a trivial fix for this case.
