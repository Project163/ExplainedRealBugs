Using log4net with newer versions of nunit means that no\nlog file is created.\n\nDemonstration follows.\n\nI created the solution in VS 2008.\nThe OS is Windows XP.\nI tested using both the nunit GUI and console.\nI compared Nunit 2.2.5 with 2.5.5 (I suspect 2.5.0 will fail as well.)\nThe solution is created as a console app.\n\nWhen the app is run as a console application a Log file is produced.\nWhen the app is run using 2.2.5 a Log file is produced.\nWhen the app is run using 2.5.5 no Log file is produced.\n\nRepro details and other info at
