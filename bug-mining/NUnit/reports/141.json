I have tried stepping through and figuring out where things go wrong but without success. \r\n\r\nI *presume* I am using the API correctly - I expected the assertion to check that the array contained `donkey` and did not contain `mule`. If I am wrong, I would appreciate some guidance on how to chain these constraints using the fluent API - or should one write 2 separate assertions?","closed_by":{"login":"ChrisMaddock","id":4837132,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4MzcxMzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4837132?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChrisMaddock","html_url":"https://github.com/ChrisMaddock","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChrisMaddock/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChrisMaddock/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChrisMaddock/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChrisMaddock/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChrisMaddock/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChrisMaddock/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChrisMaddock/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChrisMaddock/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChrisMaddock/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nunit/nunit/issues/2411/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nunit/nunit/issues/2411/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
