This includes platforms like .NET Core and Universal Windows. Ideally, this will also improve the way we run tests on mobile platforms like Android and iOS.\r\n\r\nSince these features will be a part of the engine, any runners using the engine will automatically support the new platforms.\r\n\r\nIn addition, we will be fixing issues and completing enhancements in the backlog in priority order.\r\n\r\nWe are planning on maintaining a quarterly release cycle and plan on releasing 3.4 at the end of June.","creator":{"login":"CharliePoole","id":2678661,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2Nzg2NjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2678661?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole","html_url":"https://github.com/CharliePoole","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"open_issues":0,"closed_issues":54,"state":"closed","created_at":"2015-12-04T19:46:32Z","updated_at":"2016-06-27T02:50:32Z","due_on":"2016-06-30T07:00:00Z","closed_at":"2016-06-25T16:58:54Z"},"comments":12,"created_at":"2016-04-21T19:32:18Z","updated_at":"2016-04-27T13:15:29Z","closed_at":"2016-04-27T02:45:46Z","author_association":"MEMBER","type":null,"active_lock_reason":null,"sub_issues_summary":{"total":0,"completed":0,"percent_completed":0},"issue_dependencies_summary":{"blocked_by":0,"total_blocked_by":0,"blocking":0,"total_blocking":0},"body":"As any test finishes, on its own thread, it updates its own test result and adds that result to the parent Result. This is an obvious point where different threads can come into conflict, so the Children property of TestSuiteResult needs to be thread-safe. For the last child test of a parent, additional updates are done, which can ripple up the result hierarchy all the way to the top.\n\nAdditionally, the SetResult method should be examined since it is called on other occasions in addition to a call from within AddResult.\n\nIf it's reasonably easy, the whole class could be made thread-safe, but the above items seem to represent the minimum.\n\nI'm calling this a bug, even though we have not had problems reported, since it's obvious that threading conflicts can occur. This should be fixed before we attempt to run test cases in parallel within a fixture, since that would increase the probability of a collision significantly.\n","closed_by":{"login":"rprouse","id":493828,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5MzgyOA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/493828?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rprouse","html_url":"https://github.com/rprouse","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rprouse/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rprouse/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rprouse/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rprouse/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rprouse/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rprouse/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rprouse/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rprouse/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rprouse/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nunit/nunit/issues/1434/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nunit/nunit/issues/1434/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
