sure if this has been raised before, couldn't find a similar issue. \r\n\r\nI have a test with both Retry and Timeout attribute but when a test is retried the timeout isn't being reset to

Result:** Both tests to pass after a retry\r\n\r\n**Actual Result** Test1 passes as expected but Test2 fails with message _Test exceeded Timeout value of 3000ms_. \r\n\r\nIt looks like the timeout isn't being reset when the test starts the second time, is this the expected result or should a reset be performed for each retry of the tests. \r\n\r\n_**ps** sorry about the code sample, doesn't look to be formatting everything_\r\n\r\n_@ChrisMaddock edit: fixed
