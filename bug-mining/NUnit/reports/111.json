For this release, we will fill in some gaps to consolidate those gains.\r\n\r\nKey Planned Features:\r\n* Allow multiple engines to co-exist, with differing sets of extensions installed.\r\n* Increase use of extensions.\r\n* Provide a way for NUnit to install it's own extensions.\r\n* Provide a way for users to manage the extensions.\r\n* Separate OneTimeSetUp and OneTimeTearDown work items.\r\n* Implement a generalized dependency mechanism between work items.\r\n* Implement parallel test case execution.\r\n* Implement one of the proposed test dependency or ordering mechanisms.\r\n* Integrate the Xamarin runners with NUnit in some way to be determined\r\n","creator":{"login":"CharliePoole","id":2678661,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2Nzg2NjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2678661?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole","html_url":"https://github.com/CharliePoole","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"open_issues":0,"closed_issues":49,"state":"closed","created_at":"2015-06-20T12:08:30Z","updated_at":"2016-05-21T15:22:49Z","due_on":"2016-02-29T08:00:00Z","closed_at":"2016-03-05T22:29:57Z"},"comments":8,"created_at":"2016-01-15T13:04:16Z","updated_at":"2016-06-23T12:25:31Z","closed_at":"2016-05-21T15:22:49Z","author_association":"NONE","type":null,"active_lock_reason":null,"sub_issues_summary":{"total":0,"completed":0,"percent_completed":0},"issue_dependencies_summary":{"blocked_by":0,"total_blocked_by":0,"blocking":0,"total_blocking":0},"body":"I'm
