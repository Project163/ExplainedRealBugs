3 was released a couple of weeks ago. It's output format is fairly different than the NUnit 2 format, so it should probably have a separate parser.\n\nAs a temporary workaround, NUnit 3 can output XML in v2 format with the `--result=nunit2.xml;format=nunit2` command line.\n\nOne way to identify the two formats is that the root element for v2 is `test-results` whereas it is `test-run` for v3.\n\nFor reference, here are results for the same tests in v2 and v3 format. Note, there is a bug in the v2 format produced by NUnit 3 (nunit/nunit#1042) where the categories are reported as properties. This will hopefully be fixed in a release next week.\n\n**NUnit v2 Format**\n\n``` xml\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\" standalone=\"no\"?>\n<!--This file represents the results of running a

the 3.4 release, we plan to improve the engine to allow it to run tests targeting platforms and .NET frameworks that are currently only supported through NUnitLite based runners. This includes platforms like .NET Core and Universal Windows. Ideally, this will also improve the way we run tests on mobile platforms like Android and iOS.\r\n\r\nSince these features will be a part of the engine, any runners using the engine will automatically support the new platforms.\r\n\r\nIn addition, we will be fixing issues and completing enhancements in the backlog in priority order.\r\n\r\nWe are planning on maintaining a quarterly release cycle and plan on releasing 3.4 at the end of June.","creator":{"login":"CharliePoole","id":2678661,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2Nzg2NjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2678661?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole","html_url":"https://github.com/CharliePoole","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"open_issues":0,"closed_issues":54,"state":"closed","created_at":"2015-12-04T19:46:32Z","updated_at":"2016-06-27T02:50:32Z","due_on":"2016-06-30T07:00:00Z","closed_at":"2016-06-25T16:58:54Z"},"comments":5,"created_at":"2016-05-12T13:36:56Z","updated_at":"2016-05-12T18:32:17Z","closed_at":"2016-05-12T18:32:17Z","author_association":"MEMBER","type":null,"active_lock_reason":null,"sub_issues_summary":{"total":0,"completed":0,"percent_completed":0},"issue_dependencies_summary":{"blocked_by":0,"total_blocked_by":0,"blocking":0,"total_blocking":0},"repository":{"id":13692183,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMzY5MjE4Mw==","name":"nunit","full_name":"nunit/nunit","private":false,"owner":{"login":"nunit","id":2678858,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjI2Nzg4NTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2678858?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nunit","html_url":"https://github.com/nunit","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nunit/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nunit/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nunit/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nunit/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nunit/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nunit/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nunit/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nunit/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nunit/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/nunit/nunit","description":"NUnit
