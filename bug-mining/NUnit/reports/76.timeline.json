our shop, we have a custom runner with the following switches:\n- retry - since there are tests that sometimes fail and sometimes pass, we are able to set the runner to \"retry\" all failing tests.\n- category - instead of using the CategoryAttribute, we have our custom attributes HighAttribute, MediumAttribute and LowAttribute so we can use -c High\n- team - we tag our TestFixture/Test with our custom attribute TeamAttribute so we can use -t \"SomeTeam\"\n\nRequests:\n1. It would be nice to be able to request the runner to retry the failed tests and possible indicate the number of retry. For example: `-retry 3`\n2. It would be nice to have a switch to allow selecting tests via attribute.\nFor example, given the custom attributes above:\n-attribute Medium,Low (or any other custom attribute)\n-attribute Team(\"SomeTeam\") - (am not sure if switches can be used this way)\n\nAlso, I have read somewhere that there might be a built-in IssueAttribute.

This would be used, for example, in a gui text box or as a command line argument.\n\nA simple filter consists of a key word, an operator and a value or set of values. For example:\n    id=123\n    name%test\n    category=Urgent\n    Priority=High\n\n**Key words** ~~are case-insensitive and~~ include id, name, test, fullname, class, method, category and any property names defined on the test. The key word 'test' is a synonym for fullname used for compatibility with the console runner --test option. All values are strings.\n\nThree operators are defined initially:\n\n= tests for equality\n!= tests for inequality\n% tests for string containment and may be read as 'like'\n\nsimple filters may be combined in expressions using &, | and parentheses.\nA parenthesized expression may be preceded by unary ! (not)\n\nWhile we could implement operator - to mean \"and not\" as in the NUnit 2.x syntax for included and excluded categories, this would make it impossible to use '-' as a part of the name of a category, so I have omitted it.\n\nThe general idea here is that an expression formed by the above rules could be used with a --select option on the command line, replacing and extending the current --test, --include and --exclude options. Depending on the host operating system, it might be necessary to put the expression in parentheses when it contains certain characters.\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nunit/nunit/issues/comments/129661689/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"CharliePoole","id":2678661,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2Nzg2NjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2678661?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole","html_url":"https://github.com/CharliePoole","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":378651789,"node_id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDM3ODY1MTc4OQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nunit/nunit/issues/events/378651789","actor":{"login":"CharliePoole","id":2678661,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2Nzg2NjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2678661?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole","html_url":"https://github.com/CharliePoole","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2015-08-11T01:52:57Z","label":{"name":"status:review","color":"eb6420"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":391102895,"node_id":"MDE1Ok1pbGVzdG9uZWRFdmVudDM5MTEwMjg5NQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nunit/nunit/issues/events/391102895","actor":{"login":"CharliePoole","id":2678661,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2Nzg2NjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2678661?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole","html_url":"https://github.com/CharliePoole","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"milestoned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2015-08-24T22:17:22Z","milestone":{"title":"3.0RC"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":391102896,"node_id":"MDE3OkRlbWlsZXN0b25lZEV2ZW50MzkxMTAyODk2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nunit/nunit/issues/events/391102896","actor":{"login":"CharliePoole","id":2678661,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2Nzg2NjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2678661?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole","html_url":"https://github.com/CharliePoole","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":

to Merge**\n\nThis is my first cut at resolving #374. Here's what's done in the initial commit:\n- NUnit-console has a new option --where, which takes a string (usually quoted) that describes what to select.\n- The console display has been modified to show all test filtering including the list of tests provided by --test or --testlist, categories provided through --include or --exclude and the where clause itself.\n- The creation of a test filter is done by the TestFilterService of the engine. This is a new service. It incorporates, in modified  form, the TestFixtureBuilder class previously in the console project and a parser for the selection language.\n- New filter types have been created for selection of tests by Name, MethodName and ClassName. (We previously only filtered on the FullName of the test). I verified manually that the new filters work but I have not yet added tests - they are actually just copies of an existing filter with the field to examine being the only thing changed.\n- The operators == and != are fully implemented - that is, they create a filter, which is passed to the framework and does the right thing. The =~ and !~ operators are parsed correctly but don't yet create filters that work.\n- The lhs comparison keywords category, cat, test, fullname, name, method, class and id all work, but the results may be unexpected in some cases. For example, selecting by class name causes all explicit tests to be executed. Details like this still have to be worked out.\n- The rhs of each comparison may usually be a \"word\" or a string. Strings are delimited with double quotes, single quotes or slashes. We may add others. Backslash allows escaping the quote char so it may be included. You use \\ to include a backslash.\n- Combination of comparisons with && and || (or & and |) is supported. Normal precedence is observed and may be changed using parentheses. A ! symbol may precede any parenthesized expression, negating it.\n\nRemaining to be done at this time:\n- More thorough testing, particularly all the way through to the framework.\n- Addition of property names in the comparisons.\n- Some key decisions about how this is implemented and where to take it - see below.\n\nReview needed:\n- My code, obviously.\n- The optioins supported on the console. It seems to me we have no choice but to support --testlist for people who generate lists of tests to be run. We could decide to remove --test, --include and --exclude, since everything they do is doable with the selection language.\n- Review and finalize the syntax. Possibly think up a name for this language. NTSL?\n- Review my decision to put it in the engine. I think it makes sense that each runner not have to create this themselves. I could have just made filters simply contain the language itself but the use of a builder allows a bit more flexibility.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nunit/nunit/issues/877/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nunit/nunit/issues/877/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":432264917,"node_id":"MDE1Ok1pbGVzdG9uZWRFdmVudDQzMjI2NDkxNw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nunit/nunit/issues/events/432264917","actor":{"login":"CharliePoole","id":2678661,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2Nzg2NjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2678661?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole","html_url":"https://github.com/CharliePoole","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"milestoned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2015-10-11T03:48:08Z","milestone":{"title":"3.0Beta5"},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
