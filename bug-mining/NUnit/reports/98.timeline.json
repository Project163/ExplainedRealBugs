have several different test assemblies in various folders that I have configured using an nunit project file. \nHere is the contents of the config. \n\n``` <NUnitProject>\n<Settings activeconfig=\"active\" appbase=\"c:\\projects\\hyena\\source\\Tests\\\"/>\n    <Config name=\"active\" binpath=\"Buzzard.Tests.Unit\\bin\\Debug\\;FileService.Test.Unit\\bin\\Debug\\;Hyena.Tests.Framework.Unit\\bin\\Debug\\\">\n        <assembly path=\"Buzzard.Tests.Unit\\bin\\Debug\\Buzzard.Tests.Unit.dll\"/>\n        <assembly path=\"FileService.Tests.Unit\\bin\\Debug\\FileService.Tests.Unit.dll\"/>\n        <assembly path=\"Hyena.Tests.Framework.Unit\\bin\\Debug\\Hyena.Tests.Framework.Unit.dll\"/>\n    </Config>\n</NUnitProject>\n```\n\n Each test assembly has its own config file named to match the test assembly (i.e. Buzzard.Tests.Unit.dll.config) that resides next to the corresponding test assembly. \n\nThe nunit project file resides in the appbase directory.  \n\nWhen I run this from the command line with the following \n    `'C:\\Program Files (x86)\\NUnit.org\\bin\\nunit-console.exe' testconfig.nunit`\nthe test assemblies are not able to find their own config files.  I logged the `AppDomain.CurrentDomain.SetupInformation.ConfigurationFile` to see what was being picked up and the output was basically the correct file name in the wrong location:\n\n```\nFileService.Tests.Unit.FileServiceUnitTests.DeleteFile_SavedFile_DeleteIsNotCalled\nc:\\projects\\hyena\\source\\Tests\\FileService.Tests.Unit.dll.config\n```\n\nSo in this case I would expect the source for the config to be  `c:\\projects\\hyena\\source\\Tests\\FileService.Tests.Unit\\bin\\Debug\\FileService.Tests.Unit.dll.config` but it is looking in the appbase folder for that file instead of the location where the test assembly is. \n\nThe same set of suites run without failure through VS with the VS test adapter.  They also work if I just pass the file list for the test assemblies directly to the command line without using the nunit project config. \n\nI discovered this issue when trying to run the suites through TeamCity on our build server.  TeamCity generates a nunit project on the fly in order to execute the tests through the console.  \n\nI feel like I may be missing something fundamental in my setup because it seems like a pretty common configuration and was surprised that no one else seems to have encountered this issue.

fixes #1015. It's a bigger change than I really like to do between two RCs but it's an important issue.\n\nI reworked the order of setting up the domain to make it easier to test and added some tests.\n\nI also implemented a basic policy change as compared to NUnit V2: when running a project file named project.nunit (or any other project type) the config file project.nunit is only set up for the AppDomain if it exists, otherwise, we use the individual assembly configs.\n\nThis is not exactly a \"breaking change\" - it actually fixes something that was broken before - but it is a change in behavior.\n\nNote that when multiple assemblies are made to run in the same AppDomain, there is no way for NUnit to give them separate config

(If you force them into into the same AppDomain, NUnit tries to figure out a common base and errors if it can't find one.)\n\nAssemblies in a project file default to using the location of that file as an appbase. You can change it for each config or globally, but not for each assembly. The logic for this is that allowing you to specify it for each assembly would create the possibility of several conflicts in the file, for which we would have to generate error messages. The current approach keeps it simple but does not allow you to place assemblies in a project unless they have a common appbase. We could conceivably change the default behavior, but this would be at the expense of having different defaults depending on the settings for domainUsage and processModel. I think that would be even more confusing.\n\nYour project file changes are exactly what is needed. You could, of course, remove the Default entries, giving you\n\n```\n<Settings activeconfig=\"Debug\" appbase=\"..\\..\\src\" />\n  <Config name=\"Debug\">\n```\n\nAs you discovered, a hand-edited project file must specify the path to each assembly relative to the ApplicationBase.
