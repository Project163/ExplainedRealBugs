version:**  3.5.0\n**Runner**: NUnit3TestAdapter 3.4.1\n**Environment**: Visual Studio 2015 Pro Update 1\n\nI'm having troubles using one element byte array passed to NUnit test with `TestCaseSourceAttribute`.\n\nHow to reproduce:\n\n```\npublic class Test\n    {\n        private static List<byte[]> _byteArrays = new List<byte[]>\n        {\n            new byte[] { 80 }, // - works fine with commented out\n            new byte[] { 80, 75 },\n            new byte[] { 80, 75, 03 }\n        };\n\n        [Test]\n        [TestCaseSource(\"_byteArrays\")]\n        public void TestStuff(byte[] byteArray)\n        {\n            Assert.IsFalse(false);\n        }\n    }\n```\n\nWhen you run `TestStuff` it will attempt to test things in seperate tests like this:\n\n![nunit](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/6330789/19486757/ec8547d2-955f-11e6-866f-0132fb608532.jpg)\n\nIt clearly seems that first element is treated as an `System.Byte` instead of `System.Byte[]`.\n\nError produced by NUnit tells it clearly:\n\n> Result Message:System.ArgumentException : Object of type 'System.Byte' cannot be converted to type 'System.Byte[]'\n\nAny ideas on fixing this?\nThanks!\n","closed_by":{"login":"rprouse","id":493828,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5MzgyOA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/493828?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rprouse","html_url":"https://github.com/rprouse","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rprouse/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rprouse/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rprouse/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rprouse/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rprouse/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rprouse/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rprouse/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rprouse/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rprouse/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nunit/nunit/issues/1851/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nunit/nunit/issues/1851/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
