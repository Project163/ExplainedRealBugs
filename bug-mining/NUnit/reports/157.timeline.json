NUnit.","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nunit/nunit/issues/comments/352821344/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"jnm2","id":8040367,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgwNDAzNjc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8040367?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jnm2","html_url":"https://github.com/jnm2","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jnm2/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jnm2/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jnm2/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jnm2/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jnm2/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jnm2/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jnm2/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jnm2/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jnm2/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nunit/nunit/issues/comments/352822184","html_url":"https://github.com/nunit/nunit/issues/2627#issuecomment-352822184","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nunit/nunit/issues/2627","id":352822184,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM1MjgyMjE4NA==","user":{"login":"jnm2","id":8040367,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgwNDAzNjc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8040367?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jnm2","html_url":"https://github.com/jnm2","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jnm2/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jnm2/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jnm2/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jnm2/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jnm2/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jnm2/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jnm2/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jnm2/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jnm2/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-12-19T17:03:03Z","updated_at":"2017-12-19T17:03:03Z","body":"We
