The below reproduces the crash with NUnit 3.2.\n\n```\n    [TestFixtureSource(\"SupportedEnumerableTypesForDeserialization\")]\n    public class ArrayTestCase<T>\n    {\n        private string _aString;\n\n        public ArrayTestCase(string aString)\n        {\n            _aString = aString;\n        }\n\n        [Test]\n        public void Test()\n        {\n            Assert.That(_aString, Is.EqualTo(\"Something\"));\n        }\n\n        public static IEnumerable<string> SupportedEnumerableTypesForDeserialization\n        {\n            get\n            {\n                yield return \"TestCase\";\n            }\n       }\n    }\n```\n\nAdditionally verified that the console returns zero on this crash - as it's at test-suite level, and only invalid assemblies, or individual tests are counted towards the return code.

the 3.4 release, we plan to improve the engine to allow it to run tests targeting platforms and .NET frameworks that are currently only supported through NUnitLite based runners. This includes platforms like .NET Core and Universal Windows. Ideally, this will also improve the way we run tests on mobile platforms like Android and iOS.\r\n\r\nSince these features will be a part of the engine, any runners using the engine will automatically support the new platforms.\r\n\r\nIn addition, we will be fixing issues and completing enhancements in the backlog in priority order.\r\n\r\nWe are planning on maintaining a quarterly release cycle

As a committer, you're able to do that yourself. It's a small thing, but it allows us all the opportunity to come back and say whether we agree or disagree with how you are suggesting to handle it. Additionally, if you then decide you want to work on the issue, please assign it to yourself, so that everybody knows.\n\nIn this case, it's probably no harm since it seems like your review and fix all came together  this morning anyway. We can all comment on the issue and the fix simultaneously.

Au contraire! If anything, you understepped - if that's a word. I was taking it that you didn't feel \"authorized\" to label things as bugs, assign priorities, etc. and I wanted you to know that you are and should absolutely do those things the first time you start looking at an issue. Issues with no labelling have either not yet been looked at or were too puzzling to categorize.\n\nI initially thought you also had a PR on this, but that was for another issue, so never mind that.\n\nOK, so do we have confirmation of this bug in some form or another? If not, you should either confirm it or label and leave it for somebody else. If you want to work on it, assign it to yourself. As a new guy, you'll probably get a bunch of advice from us once you put your name on something, but you'll just have to live with that.

Please review the following and comment before I go further.\n\nTestFixtureSourceAttribute provides the arguments for instantiating a TestFixture, that is constructor arguments. The ArrayTestCase class has only a default constructor and @yaakov-h is trying to use the attribute to provide the type parameters. Unfortunately, since that's not what the attribute does, NUnit is unable to determine what type parameter to use in instantiating the class.\n\nThe repro that @ChrisMaddock wrote is slightly different. He provides a constructor taking a string argument. However, for NUnit's generic type parameter detection to come into play, we need a constructor that takes an argument of type T.\n\nIn both these examples, the simplest way to specify the type parameters is to forget about TestFixtureSoureAttribute and simply use the TypeArgs named parameter of TestFixtureAttribute. This won't solve the problem where you may need a degree of indirection in determining the types to instantiate, but that doesn't seem to be the case here.\n\nThere is at least a minimal bug here: we should be giving a better error message.\n\nAlternatively, we could take it a step further and create a new feature whereby TestFixtureSourceAttribute allowed you to specify the type parameters directly. That may be a separate issue, however.\n\nWhat do you guys think?\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nunit/nunit/issues/comments/220786068/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"CharliePoole","id":2678661,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2Nzg2NjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2678661?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole","html_url":"https://github.com/CharliePoole","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":667989227,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50NjY3OTg5MjI3","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nunit/nunit/issues/events/667989227","actor":{"login":"yaakov-h","id":426009,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyNjAwOQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/426009?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yaakov-h","html_url":"https://github.com/yaakov-h","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yaakov-h/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yaakov-h/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yaakov-h/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yaakov-h/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yaakov-h/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yaakov-h/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yaakov-h/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yaakov-h/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yaakov-h/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2016-05-21T16:09:33Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
