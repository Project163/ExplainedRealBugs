have upgraded NUnit 3 -pre to recently released version:\n\nWas:\n- nunit-3.0.0-beta-3\n- assembly version: nunit.framework, Version=3.0.5674.19279\n- NUnit 3 Test Adapter 3.0.2.0\n\nNow:\n- package: package id=\"NUnit\" version=\"3.0.0\" targetFramework=\"net45\"\n- assembly version: nunit.framework, Version=3.0.5797.27534\n- NUnit 3 Test Adapter 3.0.7.0\n\nWe had to upgrade NUnit 3 Test Adapter as well as the old version did not work with the latest version of NUnit 3 framework.\n\nThe latest version of test adapter is working great in case of non-generic test fixtures but fails to execute generic ones.\nWhen trying to execute tests that are part of generic test fixtures from Test Explorer, such tests are not getting triggered. This was working before the upgrade.\n\nAlso, the generic test fixtures are working fine when executed via nunit3-console.exe.\n\nThe below example is to reproduce the issue:\n\n``` C#\nnamespace NUnit3TestAdapterIssue.GenericTestFixtures\n{\n    using System;\n    using NUnit.Framework;\n\n    public class One\n    { }\n\n    public class Two\n    { }\n\n    [TestFixture(typeof(One), Category
