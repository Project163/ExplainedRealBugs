From @BlythMeister on https://github.com/nunit/nunit/issues/2410\r\n>  with regard to the example code, we had\r\n> Assert.That(myCollection, Contains.Item(expectedItem).Using(new

new MyCustomComparer()));\r\n> Which was a simple enough change as a 1 off, but we had around 100 usages of that old syntax with different collection names, expected names as comparers (across different projects)\r\n\r\nThis change was unintentional - the removal of CollectionContainsConstraint wasn't intended to cause any breaking changes. \r\n\r\n@mikkelbu did the below analysis of what happened:\r\n\r\n> @BlythMeister This is very unfortunate. Actually, @ChrisMaddock spotted the missing Using in aa19bd1 (see #2239 (comment)), so we added Using to the EqualConstraint in bd2091b. However, the entire PR did contain an error, so Contains.Item was again changed in 15c27e5 to return a ContainsConstraint instead of a EqualConstraint. And currently ContainsConstraint does not have a Using method.\r\n\r\n@rprouse - will leave you to decide if this should be critical or not, possibly along with https://github.com/nunit/nunit/issues/2411 - I haven't looked into that one.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nunit/nunit/issues/2412/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nunit/nunit/issues/2412/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nunit/nunit/issues/comments/327085312","html_url":"https://github.com/nunit/nunit/issues/2411#issuecomment-327085312","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nunit/nunit/issues/2411","id":327085312,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMyNzA4NTMxMg==","user":{"login":"mikkelbu","id":1007631,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMDc2MzE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1007631?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkelbu","html_url":"https://github.com/mikkelbu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkelbu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkelbu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkelbu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkelbu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkelbu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkelbu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkelbu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkelbu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkelbu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-09-05T06:41:29Z","updated_at":"2017-09-05T06:41:29Z","body":"Before implementing a solution to this I think we should have tests that cover all the functionality of CollectionContainsConstraint - as it were in version 3.7 - and then use these tests to ensure that we have kept all the behaviour.

TestElement();\r\nAssert.That(new System.Collections.Generic.List<TestElement> { element }, Has.One.Member(element));\r\n```\r\nTest fails with the following error:\r\n```\r\nMessage: System.ArgumentException : Expected: IEnumerable But was: TestElement\r\nParameter name: actual\r\n```\r\nI would expect that this sequence is either illegal, or when NUnit does allow it I would expect it to mean that the collection contains exactly 1 element and that element is equal to the provided object.\r\n\r\nSide note: I encountered this while trying to write a constraint that in hindsight should probably be expressed as:\r\n`Assert.That(new List<TestElement> { element }, Has.One.EqualTo(element));`\r\nor as:\r\n`Assert.That(new List<TestElement> { element, element2 },
