`CultureSettingAndDetectionTests` are failing on Windows 10 because constructing a `CultureInfo` with an invalid culture on that platform creates a user defined culture rather than throwing a CultureNotFoundException. I was going to fix it by adding a platform attribute, but that needed extending.\n\nI thought this would be easy, but it didn't turn out to be so. The `OSPlatform` class currently reports true for Win8.1 if the version is 6.3, but Windows 10 is currently reporting 6.3.9600. Interestingy, my Windows 8.1 machine is reporting 6.2.9200, so our Win8.1 code appears to be wrong.\n\nUnfortunately, Microsoft throws a wrench into the detection process. According to [this MSDN page](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms724832%28v=vs.85%29.aspx), Windows 10 is supposed to report as 10.0 and Windows 8 as 6.3, but **only if the application is manifested for Windows 8.1 or Windows 10**. If the application is not manifested, it is supposed to return 6.2. Oddly, I got 6.3 for Windows 10, so who knows.\n\nWe can't expect every runner or even nunitlite runner to be manifested, so, from Win8.1 on, we cannot rely on the version number to determine the OS.\n\nGoing forward, we are going to have to do one of the following;\n1. Find another way of deterninging the OS for Win8.1 and Win10, or\n2. Stop support for detecting Windows Platforms at Win 8. Document and report all modern windows as Win8+.\n\nIn some ways, I am inclined towards the second option because according to Microsoft, Windows 10 is the last version. I will believe it when I see it, but the point is that from this point forward, developers are expected to do feature detection rather than OS detection because features can be added at any time by out of band installs or windows updates.\n\nI am still going to look into alternatives to see if we can fix this. \n","closed_by":{"login":"rprouse","id":493828,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5MzgyOA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/493828?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rprouse","html_url":"https://github.com/rprouse","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rprouse/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rprouse/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rprouse/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rprouse/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rprouse/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rprouse/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rprouse/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rprouse/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rprouse/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nunit/nunit/issues/679/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nunit/nunit/issues/679/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
