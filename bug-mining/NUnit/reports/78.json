NUnit 2.6.4 console runner would place the test result xml file in the directory defined by the /work command line argument; NUnit 3.0 appears to place the test result xml file in the current directory the console runner command is being run from. The following Powershell console output shows me running the command from the \"D:\\workbench\\git\\project name\\CAT\" directory with the --work directory set to \"D:\\workbench\\git\\project name\\autobuild\\logs\\nunit\". Providing just the filename for the /result argument to the Nunit 2.6.4 console runner would have the result file placed in the working directory. After upgrading to NUnit 3.0 the console runner is placing the result file in the \"D:\\workbench\\git\\project name\\CAT\" instead of the defined work directory. If I provide an explicit path for the --result argument the result file is being created in the xpected location.\n\nConsole Output:\n\n```\nD:\\workbench\\git\\project name\\CAT> & \"D:\\workbench\\git\\project name\\CAT\\packages\\NUnit.Console.3.0.0-beta-4\\tools\\nunit-console.exe\" \"D:\\workbench\\git\\project name\\CAT\\Project.Common.Test\\bin\\Release\\Project.Common.Test.dll\" --framework=net-4.5 --labels=off --work=\"D:\\workbench\\git\\project name\\autobuild\\logs\\nunit\" --result=Project.Common.Test.xml --include=\"unit\" --exclude=\"disabled\"\n\nNUnit Console Runner 3.0.5715\nCopyright (C) 2014 Charlie Poole\n\nTest Files\n    D:\\workbench\\git\\project name\\CAT\\Project.Common.Test\\bin\\Release\\Project.Common.Test.dll\n\nRuntime Environment\n   OS Version: Microsoft Windows NT 6.1.7601 Service Pack 1\n  CLR Version: 4.0.30319.34209\n\nOptions\n    ProcessModel: Default    DomainUsage: Default\n    Execution Runtime: net-4.5\n    Work Directory: D:\\workbench\\git\\project name\\autobuild\\logs\\nunit\n    Internal Trace: Off\n\nIncluded categories: unit\nExcluded categories: disabled\n\nTest Run Summary\n    Overall result: Passed\n   Tests run: 2, Passed: 2, Errors: 0, Failures: 0, Inconclusive: 0\n     Not run: 0, Invalid: 0, Ignored: 0, Explicit: 0, Skipped: 0\n  Start time: 2015-10-15 18:46:19Z\n    End time: 2015-10-15 18:46:19Z\n    Duration: 0.257 seconds\n\nResults (nunit3) saved as Project.Common.Test.xml\n```\n","closed_by":{"login":"CharliePoole","id":2678661,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2Nzg2NjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2678661?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole","html_url":"https://github.com/CharliePoole","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nunit/nunit/issues/896/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nunit/nunit/issues/896/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
