ValueSource(Type, string) and ValueSource(string) would be removed or deprecated. They would be replaced by the existing ValueSource(Type) form which requires an extra class to be created.

the new scheme is to follow a data driven approach shouldn't the data source live outside of the compiled source? We could define a standard xml file (or another key/value source type) that is referred to data in the test(s). Some examples:\n\nTestCaseSource('data1',  int[])....\nlook for id 'data1' in standard file and interpret as an array of int\n\nTestCaseSource('data.txt', 'data1', int[])\nSame as above but we can explicitly refer to the file with data\n\nMain advantage of this is no recompile and we have clear boundaries between data and test engine. Also test data may reside in single standard location (that we define) or can be separated per the user's preference. Main problems is that for reference types this can get messy. Also it is more work to implement than the other options.\n","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nunit/nunit/issues/comments/113818516/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"acco32","id":7876672,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc4NzY2NzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7876672?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/acco32","html_url":"https://github.com/acco32","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/acco32/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/acco32/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/acco32/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/acco32/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/acco32/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/acco32/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/acco32/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/acco32/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/acco32/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nunit/nunit/issues/comments/113819339","html_url":"https://github.com/nunit/nunit/issues/698#issuecomment-113819339","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nunit/nunit/issues/698","id":113819339,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDExMzgxOTMzOQ==","user":{"login":"CharliePoole","id":2678661,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2Nzg2NjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2678661?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole","html_url":"https://github.com/CharliePoole","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-06-20T21:02:21Z","updated_at":"2015-06-20T21:02:21Z","body":"@acco32 I think I would see that as a new feature rather than a modification of TestCaseSource, which is designed for getting internal data. The new feature could build on it though.\n\nIt seems to me we once (maybe back on Sourceforge) had a request for such a feature but it seems to be lost now. I suspect we are very close to the point of being able to implement such a feature as an extension, using the interfaces that NUnit's attributes implement.\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nunit/nunit/issues/comments/113819339/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"CharliePoole","id":2678661,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2Nzg2NjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2678661?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole","html_url":"https://github.com/CharliePoole","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":335992793,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MzM1OTkyNzkz","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nunit/nunit/issues/events/335992793","actor":{"login":"acco32","id":7876672,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc4NzY2NzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7876672?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/acco32","html_url":"https://github.com/acco32","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/acco32/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/acco32/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/acco32/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/acco32/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/acco32/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/acco32/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/acco32/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/acco32/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/acco32/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2015-06-20T21:02:21Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
