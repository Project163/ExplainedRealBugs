people have been complaining on twitter because they have updated their projects to use the NUnit 3 framework, but there is no corresponding update for NUnit.Runners. They do not realize that they need to switch to the new NUnit.Console NuGet package.\n\nEven when you search NuGet for NUnit, the new NUnit.Console package is the 43'rd entry and on the third page. Most people won't find it. NUnit.Runners is the 2nd entry right after NUnit, so it is what everyone sees.\n\nEven if we put the information out on as many channels as we control (mailing list, website, twitter, etc) it will only reach a small fraction of developers who use NUnit.\n\nShould we create an update for the NUnit.Runners nuget package that contains the same binaries as the current NUnit.Console package? Once we have additional runners like the GUI, we can include them in that package and leave NUnit.Console as the lightweight, console only package.\n\nI think we should deal with this soon. NUnit 3 has only been showing up as a non-prerelease update for a couple of days. I think many people are going to be upgrading soon and running into the same problem.\n- https://www.nuget.org/packages/NUnit.Console/\n- https://www.nuget.org/packages/NUnit.Runners/\n","closed_by":{"login":"CharliePoole","id":2678661,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2Nzg2NjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2678661?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole","html_url":"https://github.com/CharliePoole","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nunit/nunit/issues/1030/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nunit/nunit/issues/1030/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
