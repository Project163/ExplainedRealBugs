sounds reasonable.

I am changing the milestone to backlog and the status to design.\n\nInstead of a Func/delegate what about an interface for a custom formatter with a format method and a property or method that specifies the `Type` that the formatter handles? End users could implement the interface and pass the `Type` to NUnit which would instantiate it and call it where needed. This type could be passed in an assembly attribute or NUnit could also find all implementations of the interface when it explores the tests.\n\nAnother option could be an assembly attribute that takes

PR fixes #1196 and replaces PR #1198, which was withdrawn by its creator @et1975.\n\nThe initial commit includes the original code from that PR plus a fix to ensure that a check for a null value is done before any custom formatters are called. This means that it is not possible to add a special display format for `null` but in compensation avoids any issues with formatters that make use of the value without checking.\n\nFurther commits will make this available through the TestContext. I'm not yet sure whether we need to keep the static method for use by F#. From some of @et1975 's comments, that seems to be the case, but he never explained how the feature would be used from F#, only that he didn't want to use it from a OneTimeSetUp method.\n\nF# folks: you can help us here. The OP has left the scene, so there's a good chance we will end up creating something that is not useful to you unless somebody else is willing to communicate.
