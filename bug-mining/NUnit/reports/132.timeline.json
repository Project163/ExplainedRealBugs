Technically both are correct, but I would think the .NET 4.5 would be more correct.\r\n\r\nA fix would be to put a copy of the .NET 4.5 assembly in a `net47` directory in the NuGet package. We might also be able to put a .props file in the `net47` directory that points to the DLL in the `net45` directory.\r\n\r\nWhen we fix this, we should also check .NET 4.6.2 and even 4.6.1 when included from the new CSPROJ format.\r\n\r\nSpeaking of, @Jivko1212, is your .NET 4.7 project using the new CSPROJ
