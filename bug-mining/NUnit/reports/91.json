The engine now has two added attributes in the test-run element. NunitLite does not.\n   \n   **Update:** Neither of these is needed in the nunitlite output\n   - `engine-version` - because no engine is involved\n   - `clr-version` - because nunitlite is running in process with the tests, so it's the same version\n2. The engine no longer has an environment element under test-run, it's under test-suite.\n3. The engine creates a test-filter element under test-run. NUnitLite does not.\n4. The engine creates a settings element under the test-suite for each assembly. NUnitLite does not.\n\nThis is an easy fix only if we don't mind adding code in NUnitLite that duplicates the engine and framework. It's possible that only some of the above items will get fixed for the RC.\n","closed_by":{"login":"rprouse","id":493828,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5MzgyOA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/493828?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rprouse","html_url":"https://github.com/rprouse","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rprouse/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rprouse/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rprouse/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rprouse/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rprouse/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rprouse/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rprouse/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rprouse/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rprouse/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nunit/nunit/issues/954/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nunit/nunit/issues/954/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
