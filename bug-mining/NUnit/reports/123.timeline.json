Lately, NUnit 2 has been receiving a few bug-fixes, but mostly driven by individual PRs. Also note that NUnit 2 has a different code structure than NUnit 3, so it is not always easy to backport changes.\r\n\r\nGiven that you are using the console runner for NUnit 3 with the NUnitV2Driver I'm not sure where one would solve this issue, but I guess in either the NUnitV2Driver or the framework, or a combination.
