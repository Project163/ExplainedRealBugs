tested this and it looks like a bug in the .NET Framework to me, so I am inclined to close this as invalid. It is crashing in NUnit in the call to GetEnumerator().\n\n[According to the documentation](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/4f47hffe%28v=vs.110%29.aspx), `ArraySegment<T>` does not have a default constructor. All of it's constructors take an array of T and if you pass in null, it is supposed to throw an `ArgumentNullException`.\n\nMy thinking is that `new ArraySegment<byte>()` is invalid even if it works and that  the nunit framework should not be protecting the developer from everything they may do wrong.\n\nI tested the more correct,\n\n``` C#\nAssert.AreEqual(new ArraySegment<byte>(new byte[]{}), new ArraySegment<byte>(new byte[]{}));\n```\n\nand it works fine.\n\nI am going to close this issue as invalid. @xplicit, if you feel I am doing so in error and you have a more complete use case or I have mis-interpreted this issue, I will be happy to re-open the issue and look at it
