Summary\r\n\r\nUnable to add `.IgnoreCase` modifier to an `AnyOf` constraint in collection constraints.\r\n\r\n# Reproducible example\r\n\r\n## Goal\r\n\r\nI was creating an assertion that all the (string) elements of a collection were one of a\r\nset of possibilities, with a case insensitive comparison\r\n\r\n## Code\r\n\r\n    Assert.That(new string[] { \"red\", \"red\", \"red\", \"green\" }, \r\n        Is.All.AnyOf(new string[] { \"RED\", \"BLUE\", \"GREEN\" }).IgnoreCase);\r\n\r\n## Expected result\r\n\r\nAssertion passed\r\n\r\n## Acutal result\r\n\r\nCompilation error:\r\n\r\n> 'Constraint' does not contain a definition for 'IgnoreCase' and no\r\n> extension method 'IgnoreCase' accepting a first argument of\r\n> type 'Constraint' could be found (are you missing a using directive or an\r\n> assembly reference?)\r\n\r\n# Variations/workarounds\r\n\r\nA simpler version for a single value instead of all the elements of a collection works:\r\n\r\n    Assert.That(\"red\", Is.AnyOf(new string[] { \"RED\", \"BLUE\" }).IgnoreCase);\r\n\r\nA suggested variation from Charlie also works\r\n\r\n    Assert.That(new string[] { \"red\", \"red\", \"red\", \"green\" }, \r\n      new AllItemsConstraint(\r\n        Is.AnyOf(new string[] { \"RED\", \"BLUE\", \"GREEN\" }).IgnoreCase));\r\n\r\n# Hypothesis of problem\r\n\r\nThe returned type of the `AnyOf` method are different in the two cases. `Is.AnyOf` returns type `AnyOfConstraint`. For `Is.All.AnyOf`, `Is.All` returns a `ConstraintExpression` and `ConstraintExpression.AnyOf` returns a `Constraint`. Were the return type `AnyOfConstraint`, then `AnyOfConstraint.IgnoreCase` could be invoked. I'm not sure if there are other implications to changing the return type.\r\n\r\n# References\r\n\r\nI asked [a question on StackOverflow about this](https://stackoverflow.com/q/52322519/892313) which is where Charlie provided a workaround.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"mikkelbu","id":1007631,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMDc2MzE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1007631?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkelbu","html_url":"https://github.com/mikkelbu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkelbu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkelbu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkelbu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkelbu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkelbu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkelbu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkelbu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkelbu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikkelbu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nunit/nunit/issues/3024/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nunit/nunit/issues/3024/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
