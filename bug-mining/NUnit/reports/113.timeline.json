appears that some real re-architecting of the abort mechanism may be required.\n\nSince the only code in a thread which really survives a thread.abort is that which is in finally clauses, all of the bookkeeping for an aborted test needs to either be there, or outside of the thread entirely.\n\nWhat seems to be happening is that only a few levels unwind before the thread just disposes itself, and there is no thread for the bookkeeping code to run on.\n\nI am investigating both options.  Putting the bookkeeping/unwinding code outside of the thread the work item is running on may be the cleanest, but putting it into finally clauses may be easier.\n","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nunit/nunit/issues/comments/170485173/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"oznetmaster","id":5798625,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3OTg2MjU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5798625?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/oznetmaster","html_url":"https://github.com/oznetmaster","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oznetmaster/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oznetmaster/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oznetmaster/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oznetmaster/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oznetmaster/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oznetmaster/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oznetmaster/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oznetmaster/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oznetmaster/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"actor":{"login":"oznetmaster","id":5798625,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3OTg2MjU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5798625?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/oznetmaster","html_url":"https://github.com/oznetmaster","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oznetmaster/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oznetmaster/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oznetmaster/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oznetmaster/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oznetmaster/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oznetmaster/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oznetmaster/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oznetmaster/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oznetmaster/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-01-11T10:17:25Z","updated_at":"2016-01-11T10:17:25Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nunit/nunit/issues/166","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nunit/nunit","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nunit/nunit/issues/166/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nunit/nunit/issues/166/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nunit/nunit/issues/166/events","html_url":"https://github.com/nunit/nunit/issues/166","id":39567998,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWUzOTU2Nzk5OA==","number":166,"title":"Cancelled
