This includes platforms like .NET Core and Universal Windows. Ideally, this will also improve the way we run tests on mobile platforms like Android and iOS.\r\n\r\nSince these features will be a part of the engine, any runners using the engine will automatically support the new platforms.\r\n\r\nIn addition, we will be fixing issues and completing enhancements in the backlog in priority order.\r\n\r\nWe are planning on maintaining a quarterly release cycle and plan on releasing 3.4 at the end of June.","creator":{"login":"CharliePoole","id":2678661,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2Nzg2NjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2678661?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole","html_url":"https://github.com/CharliePoole","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"open_issues":0,"closed_issues":54,"state":"closed","created_at":"2015-12-04T19:46:32Z","updated_at":"2016-06-27T02:50:32Z","due_on":"2016-06-30T07:00:00Z","closed_at":"2016-06-25T16:58:54Z"},"comments":1,"created_at":"2016-04-24T08:03:06Z","updated_at":"2016-04-25T01:03:37Z","closed_at":"2016-04-24T21:21:29Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","type":null,"active_lock_reason":null,"sub_issues_summary":{"total":0,"completed":0,"percent_completed":0},"issue_dependencies_summary":{"blocked_by":0,"total_blocked_by":0,"blocking":0,"total_blocking":0},"body":"Just discovered that TestOrderAttributeTests is not public.
