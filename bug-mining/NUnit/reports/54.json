assertion statement with a message\n`Assert.That(() => { Console.Write(null, null); }, Throws.TypeOf<ArgumentNullException>(), \"A message\");`\nyields the compiler errors:\n(NUnit 3.0.0 beta 2)\nerror CS1643: Not all code paths return a value in lambda expression of type 'System.Func<bool>'\nerror CS1660: Cannot convert lambda expression to type 'bool' because it is not a delegate type\n(NUnit 2.6.4)\nerror CS1660: Cannot convert lambda expression to type 'object' because it is not a delegate type.\n\nThis is due to the missing Assert.That(TestDelegate, IResolveConstraint, string, params object[]) overload.\n\nThe workaround is to wrap the anonymous method into a TestDelegate:\n`Assert.That(new TestDelegate(() => { Console.Write(null, null); }), Throws.TypeOf<ArgumentNullException>(), \"A message\");`\n\nThe cast adds unnecessary \"noise\" to the statement and the compiler errors are unexpected and confusing when encountered the first
