offending code is in `AsyncInvocationRegion.cs`\n\n``` C#\n        private class AsyncTaskInvocationRegion : AsyncInvocationRegion\n        {\n            private const string TaskWaitMethod =

This is dangerous on multiple platforms where they may not be available. In this case, the Result property is not available when we try to get the `taskResultProperty`\n\nI think this is pretty serious, possibly a candidate for a 3.0.1

this a UWP, nunit, nunit.runners issue? I added this to the tests in this solution after seeing it in mine. This is a result from the UWP emulator (Windows 10 mobile) in VS2015 on Server 2012 R2.\n\n```\n    [Test]\n    public async Task AsyncTest()\n    {\n        var result = await anInt();\n        Assert.AreEqual(42, result);\n    }\n\n    private async Task<int> anInt()\n    {\n        return 42;\n    }\n```\n\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/157766/11246511/cef21880-8dcc-11e5-88cf-613c49124dc2.png)\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nunit/nunit.xamarin/issues/35/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nunit/nunit.xamarin/issues/35/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nunit/nunit/issues/comments/157824912","html_url":"https://github.com/nunit/nunit/issues/1037#issuecomment-157824912","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nunit/nunit/issues/1037","id":157824912,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE1NzgyNDkxMg==","user":{"login":"tofutim","id":157766,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1Nzc2Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/157766?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tofutim","html_url":"https://github.com/tofutim","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tofutim/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tofutim/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tofutim/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tofutim/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tofutim/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tofutim/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tofutim/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tofutim/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tofutim/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-11-18T19:07:50Z","updated_at":"2015-11-18T19:07:50Z","body":"should async tests work in UWP?\n\nOn Wed, Nov 18, 2015 at 11:05 AM, Rob Prouse notifications@github.com\nwrote:\n\n> The offending code is in AsyncInvocationRegion.cs\n> \n> ```\n>     private class AsyncTaskInvocationRegion : AsyncInvocationRegion\n>     {\n>         private const string TaskWaitMethod = \"Wait\";\n>         private const string TaskResultProperty = \"Result\";\n>         private const string SystemAggregateException = \"System.AggregateException\";\n>         private const string InnerExceptionsProperty = \"InnerExceptions\";\n>         private const BindingFlags TaskResultPropertyBindingFlags = BindingFlags.Instance | BindingFlags.Public;\n> \n>         public override object WaitForPendingOperationsToComplete(object invocationResult)\n>         {\n>             try\n>             {\n>                 invocationResult.GetType().GetMethod(TaskWaitMethod, new Type[0]).Invoke(invocationResult, null);\n>             }\n>             catch (TargetInvocationException e)\n>             {\n>                 IList<Exception> innerExceptions = GetAllExceptions(e.InnerException);\n> ```\n> \n> #if NET_4_5 || PORTABLE\n>                     ExceptionDispatchInfo.Capture(innerExceptions[0]).Throw();\n> #elif NET_4_0\n>                     PreserveStackTrace(innerExceptions[0]);\n>                     throw innerExceptions[0];\n> #endif\n>                 }\n> \n> ```\n>             PropertyInfo taskResultProperty = invocationResult.GetType().GetProperty(TaskResultProperty, TaskResultPropertyBindingFlags);\n> \n>             return taskResultProperty != null ? taskResultProperty.GetValue(invocationResult, null) : invocationResult;\n>         }\n>     }\n> ```\n> \n> Notice, we reference methods and properties by name, then use reflection\n> to access them.

have a fix for this. I have tested in a Windows 10 app, but don't know how to write unit tests for it. The code above needs to be changed to the following.\n\n``` C#\n        private class AsyncTaskInvocationRegion : AsyncInvocationRegion\n        {\n            private const string TaskWaitMethod = \"Wait\";\n            private const string TaskResultProperty = \"Result\";\n            private const string VoidTaskResultType = \"VoidTaskResult\";\n            private const string SystemAggregateException = \"System.AggregateException\";\n            private const string InnerExceptionsProperty = \"InnerExceptions\";\n            private const BindingFlags TaskResultPropertyBindingFlags = BindingFlags.Instance | BindingFlags.Public;\n\n            public override object WaitForPendingOperationsToComplete(object invocationResult)\n            {\n                try\n                {\n                    invocationResult.GetType().GetMethod(TaskWaitMethod, new Type[0]).Invoke(invocationResult, null);\n                }\n                catch (TargetInvocationException e)\n                {\n                    IList<Exception> innerExceptions = GetAllExceptions(e.InnerException);\n\n#if NET_4_5 || PORTABLE\n                    ExceptionDispatchInfo.Capture(innerExceptions[0]).Throw();\n#elif NET_4_0\n                    PreserveStackTrace(innerExceptions[0]);\n                    throw innerExceptions[0];\n#endif\n                }\n\n                var args = invocationResult.GetType().GetGenericArguments();\n                if (args != null && args.Length == 1 && args[0].Name == VoidTaskResultType)\n                {\n                    return null;\n                }\n                PropertyInfo taskResultProperty = invocationResult.GetType().GetProperty(TaskResultProperty, TaskResultPropertyBindingFlags);\n\n                return taskResultProperty != null ? taskResultProperty.GetValue(invocationResult, null) : invocationResult;\n            }\n        }\n```\n\nThis happens for all tests that have the signature `public async Task TestMethod()`. On some platforms, you cannot get the result property if the invocation result is of type `Task<VoidTaskResult>` (which I think is mapping to plain old `Task`), it will throw an exception. I check if the result is of that type and return null instead of trying to pull the value out of the result because I know there won't be one.\n\nI tested with tests with a very long `await Task.Delay(20000)` to ensure that this does not return before the test ran to completion. The WaitForPendingOperationsToComplete is blocking in the call to `invocationResult.GetType().GetMethod(TaskWaitMethod, new Type[0]).Invoke(invocationResult, null);` so it isn't a problem.\n\n@CharliePoole, I haven't checked in a PR for this because I wanted to confirm that this is worthy of a 3.0.1 release, possibly along with a few other issues you have flagged. If that is so, I will start a 3.0.1 release branch and create the PR off of that.\n\nIf you have time, can you let me know if you agree with that plan?
