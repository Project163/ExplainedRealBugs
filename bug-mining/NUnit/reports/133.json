This change\r\nenables several constraints and other features in the .NET Standard builds that\r\nweren't available in portable like Path and Directory based asserts.\r\n\r\nThe AssertionHelper class has been deprecated because it is seldom used and has\r\nnot received any of the updates that Asserts and Constraints receive. If your code\r\nis using the AssertionHelper class, we recommend that you migrate your asserts.","creator":{"login":"CharliePoole","id":2678661,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2Nzg2NjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2678661?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole","html_url":"https://github.com/CharliePoole","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"open_issues":0,"closed_issues":69,"state":"closed","created_at":"2015-12-04T19:49:19Z","updated_at":"2017-05-29T22:58:48Z","due_on":"2017-05-26T07:00:00Z","closed_at":"2017-05-29T22:58:48Z"},"comments":0,"created_at":"2017-05-09T17:13:36Z","updated_at":"2017-05-25T08:24:14Z","closed_at":"2017-05-24T21:17:36Z","author_association":"MEMBER","type":null,"active_lock_reason":null,"sub_issues_summary":{"total":0,"completed":0,"percent_completed":0},"issue_dependencies_summary":{"blocked_by":0,"total_blocked_by":0,"blocking":0,"total_blocking":0},"body":"The current help text is `SetupFixtureAttribute is used to identify a SetupFixture`, less than helpful if you don't already know what a SetupFixture is.\r\n\r\nI propose that at a minimum, we use the help text from the [attribute docs](https://github.com/nunit/docs/wiki/Attributes), `Marks a class with one-time setup or teardown methods for all the test fixtures in a namespace.` or extend it with `<see cref=\"\" />` tags like `Marks a class with <see cref=\"OneTimeSetupAttribute\" /> or <see cref=\"OneTimeTearDownAttribute\" /> methods for all the test fixtures in a namespace.`\r\n\r\nMany of our attributes are well documented, but we should review.","closed_by":{"login":"CharliePoole","id":2678661,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2Nzg2NjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2678661?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole","html_url":"https://github.com/CharliePoole","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharliePoole/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nunit/nunit/issues/2158/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nunit/nunit/issues/2158/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
