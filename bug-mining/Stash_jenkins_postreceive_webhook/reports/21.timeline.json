That is correct and, unfortunately, a fallout of not using the hash code.  When not sending the hash code, the Jenkins plugin performs a poll to see if any changes actually occurred.  If so, a build is triggered.  When providing the hash, Jenkins doesn't poll and goes straight to a build.  \n\nSince notifications are sent with each push to Stash, the \"Trigger Build\" button can't successfully re-trigger a build without the use of the hash.

just upgraded the Stash Webhook to Jenkins to the latest version where the new option \"Omit SHA1 Hash Code\" is added.\nIt seems that this new option changed the behavior of the plugin, Now when it is un-checked (default for enabled repos) the parameter $GIT_BRANCH is passed with the value 'detached' when triggering a build manually. In the earlier versions this parameter was not passed at all.\nThis makes a lot of our builds to fail and I need to check this new option for all repos where I don't want this parameter to be passed. My issue is that I have 820 repos using this plugin!\nIn my opinion the Omit-option should have been checked as default when upgrading the plugin since this mimics the previous behavior.\nIs there a way to \"bulk\"-update these repos checking this option?\nPlease get back at your earliest convenience. This is quite an issue at the moment!\nCheers,\n// Svante\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mohamicorp/stash-jenkins-postreceive-webhook/issues/92/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mohamicorp/stash-jenkins-postreceive-webhook/issues/92/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
