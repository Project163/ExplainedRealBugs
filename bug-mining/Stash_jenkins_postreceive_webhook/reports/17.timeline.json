My use case is - \n\nWe commit back the version number into the pom of our project after a successful build. \n\nSo when a change to a branch, say \"xyz\" triggers the jenkins job, jenkins builds \"release\" branch again as it sees a commit in \"release\" which was just a release number change (which I don't want to build).\n\nLet me explain it below:\n1. Change pushed to \"release\"\n2. Jenkins notified and job executes\n3. On successful job execution, the version number is updated and pushed back to \"release\" branch, so that \"release\" branch is ready for the next build\n4. Another change is now pushed to \"xyz\" but I don't intend this to cause execution of the Jenkins job\n5. However, jenkins sees that it has been triggered via the webhook and there is a change in \"release\" via step 3 which it hasn't seen before. So it builds \"release\"!\n\nSo because we want the version number of our pom pushed back to \"release\" just relying on jenkins to build \"release\" is not sufficient. We need to stop the webhook from firing if the change is not pushed to a pre-configured branch name.\n","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mohamicorp/stash-jenkins-postreceive-webhook/issues/comments/37972414/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"anuragkapur","id":864639,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg2NDYzOQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/864639?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/anuragkapur","html_url":"https://github.com/anuragkapur","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anuragkapur/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anuragkapur/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anuragkapur/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anuragkapur/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anuragkapur/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anuragkapur/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anuragkapur/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anuragkapur/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anuragkapur/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mohamicorp/stash-jenkins-postreceive-webhook/issues/comments/37973719","html_url":"https://github.com/mohamicorp/stash-jenkins-postreceive-webhook/issues/58#issuecomment-37973719","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mohamicorp/stash-jenkins-postreceive-webhook/issues/58","id":37973719,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM3OTczNzE5","user":{"login":"mikesir87","id":746837,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc0NjgzNw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/746837?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikesir87","html_url":"https://github.com/mikesir87","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikesir87/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikesir87/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikesir87/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikesir87/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikesir87/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikesir87/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikesir87/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikesir87/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikesir87/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-03-18T18:57:55Z","updated_at":"2014-03-18T18:57:55Z","body":"Ok.
