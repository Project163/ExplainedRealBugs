I've even seen this happen repeatedly for several commit links on the same PR.  Further, as long as these pages 404, I've seen that Jenkins is NOT getting notified about the commits, and thus no new builds.\n\nThe workaround here is to view the Diff tab on the PR.  It's as though Stash having to handle the Diff view is what actually creates the individual Commit pages, and once these Commit pages are available and not 404ing, then the Jenkins notifications happen and new builds happen.\n\nMy app versions are:  Stash v2.6.2; Jenkins v1.535.\n","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mohamicorp/stash-jenkins-postreceive-webhook/issues/comments/30012175/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"ashnazg","id":100170,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMDE3MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/100170?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashnazg","html_url":"https://github.com/ashnazg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashnazg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashnazg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashnazg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashnazg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashnazg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashnazg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashnazg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashnazg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashnazg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mohamicorp/stash-jenkins-postreceive-webhook/issues/comments/30015383","html_url":"https://github.com/mohamicorp/stash-jenkins-postreceive-webhook/issues/38#issuecomment-30015383","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mohamicorp/stash-jenkins-postreceive-webhook/issues/38","id":30015383,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMwMDE1Mzgz","user":{"login":"mikesir87","id":746837,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc0NjgzNw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/746837?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikesir87","html_url":"https://github.com/mikesir87","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikesir87/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikesir87/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikesir87/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikesir87/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikesir87/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikesir87/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikesir87/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikesir87/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikesir87/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2013-12-06T18:06:12Z","updated_at":"2013-12-06T18:06:12Z","body":"Hmm... nice to know.
