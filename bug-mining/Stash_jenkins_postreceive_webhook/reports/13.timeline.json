@mikesir87, indeed, we pass `null` as an argument there because we have no user information at that moment.\n\nI doubt it's possible to use any reasonable user account for those events as the plugin fetches revisions from Subversion server once in a while and these revisions may belong to different authors (even to those who are not yet registered in Stash).\n\nI had a look into Stash docs, and [getUser](https://developer.atlassian.com/static/javadoc/stash/2.10.0/api/reference/com/atlassian/stash/event/StashEvent.html#getUser(\\)) method is annotated as Nullable, so null check is required anyway.\n\nOn a related note, [RepositoryPushEvent docs](https://developer.atlassian.com/static/javadoc/stash/2.10.0/api/reference/com/atlassian/stash/event/RepositoryPushEvent.html) has the following statement:\n\n> Listeners that are interested in all ref changes, not just those stemming from pushes (such as pull request merges), should listen for RepositoryRefsChangedEvents instead.\n\nI think SubGit plugin should raise some relevant subclass of `RepositoryRefsChangedEvent` instead of `RepositoryPushEvent` as it makes more sense. But whatever event it is, we still can't provide any user information with
