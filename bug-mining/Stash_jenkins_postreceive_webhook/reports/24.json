It simply informs Jenkins that new commits are available. It doesn't force a build right now: the build queue could be full, or Jenkins may not even have a job for that git URL.\n\nHowever, the ability to notify Jenkins as soon as a pull request is merged, is really useful. Without it, we have to configure Jenkins to just poll git continually. Could we provide an option to disable or hide the button?\n","closed_by":{"login":"mikesir87","id":746837,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc0NjgzNw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/746837?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikesir87","html_url":"https://github.com/mikesir87","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikesir87/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikesir87/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikesir87/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikesir87/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikesir87/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikesir87/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikesir87/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikesir87/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikesir87/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mohamicorp/stash-jenkins-postreceive-webhook/issues/98/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mohamicorp/stash-jenkins-postreceive-webhook/issues/98/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
