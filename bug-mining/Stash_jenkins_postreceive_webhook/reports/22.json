I specify http proxy in Java system properties. (I add `-Dhttp.proxyHost=<proxy-hostname>` and `-Dhttp.proxyPort=<proxy-port-number>` to `JVM_SUPPORT_RECOMMENDED_ARGS` in `setenv.sh`.) In my test I found Jenkins Webhook ignored those proxy configurations and it tried to send HTTP request directly to the Jenkins server.\n\nI would like all the requests by the add-on respect the config, or a new add-on config to toggle the behaviour of sending the trigger (via proxy / directly).\n","closed_by":{"login":"mikesir87","id":746837,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc0NjgzNw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/746837?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikesir87","html_url":"https://github.com/mikesir87","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikesir87/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikesir87/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikesir87/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikesir87/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikesir87/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikesir87/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikesir87/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikesir87/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikesir87/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mohamicorp/stash-jenkins-postreceive-webhook/issues/93/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mohamicorp/stash-jenkins-postreceive-webhook/issues/93/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
