is on the latest Sierra and High Sierra, with an Xbox 360 controller connected to a USB-C port (using a USB-A to USB-C adapter) on a MacBook Pro 2017 model.\r\n\r\nThe controller must be connected on application startup (found using _glfwJoystickPresent_). Any controllers connected after startup are not detected (the callback is not triggered), and neither are disconnections of controllers detected initially (e.g., the joystick callback does not appear to function on MacOS).\r\n\r\nIt seems that a controller must be connected before _glfwInit_ is called for it to be detected. I was able to work around this error by re-initializing GLFW in an update loop every second (this application is solely for gamepad input). Using this method, I can successfully detect connections and disconnections (though I must manually call _glfwJoystickPresent_ during this phase for known controllers to decide if they have been disconnected.","closed_by":{"login":"elmindreda","id":133714,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMzcxNA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/133714?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda","html_url":"https://github.com/elmindreda","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/glfw/glfw/issues/1218/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/glfw/glfw/issues/1218/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
