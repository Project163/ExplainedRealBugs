frustrating that there is a target named \"vulkan\" exactly in the glfw cmake project. I am working on an application that uses Vulkan with GLFW, so it shocked the hell out of me that this was an issue.\r\n\r\nI *really* don't want to use ExternalProject or find_package for installed binaries, another nonsense. I want to just use add_subdirectory on both, but cannot.\r\n\r\nReally REALLY wished cmake had an option in add_subdirectory for including targets in namepsaces to prevent this problem like:\r\n\r\n`add_subdirectory(\r\n    glfw\r\n   \"some/path/to/glfw/subdir\"\r\n    NAMESPACE GLFW\r\n)` \r\n\r\nthat would import all targets in the subdir with a prefixed namespace GLFW:, but sadly, this is not a feature in cmake (yet).\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, can we please make our target names a lot less ambiguous? Cmake is just not that good at this.","closed_by":{"login":"elmindreda","id":133714,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMzcxNA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/133714?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda","html_url":"https://github.com/elmindreda","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/glfw/glfw/issues/1477/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/glfw/glfw/issues/1477/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
