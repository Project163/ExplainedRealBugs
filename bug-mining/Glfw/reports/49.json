first 'cmake .' fails because the Xf86vidmode library is not found (I don't believe it is available for cygwin).  Looking at the code, it seems that the Xf86vidmode is only a fallback if a recent enough Xrandr is not available.  I commented out the parts of the CMakeLists.txt and the src/\\* lines referring to the missing functions.  Now I am able to run 'cmake .' successfully.\n\nBut, when I try to make things, I get an error in src/x11_window.c where the CARD32 type is not defined.  I looked in src/glfw_config.h and it seems that the #defines are present but they are only #define-d and not set to 1.  When I made that change by hand, then I was able to compile the entire project (with some warnings about deprecated doxygen stuff).\n\nNow when I try running the examples, I get the following errors:\n ./boing.exe \nX Error of failed request:  BadRRCrtc (invalid Crtc parameter)\n  Major opcode of failed request:  140 (RANDR)\n  Minor opcode of failed request:  22 (RRGetCrtcGammaSize)\n  Crtc id in failed request: 0x0\n  Serial number of failed request:  56\n  Current serial number in output stream:  56\n\nAnd I've reached the limits of what I can figure out as I'm not familiar with Xrandr or what the correct answer would be at this point.  It seems like there may be an issue with the Xrandr code that might be shadowed by the availability of Xf86vidmode (purely a guess???)\n\nRegards,\nChris\n","closed_by":{"login":"elmindreda","id":133714,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMzcxNA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/133714?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda","html_url":"https://github.com/elmindreda","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/glfw/glfw/issues/406/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/glfw/glfw/issues/406/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
