looks like the call to _glfwPlatformPollEvents was added with the helper window in commit 4cd493dd9a461e9c06f9cae1ac27d015d38a71f7.\n\nI would like an option to avoid this call (or if it's not necessary remove it without an option). In my specific scenario I already have a GUI toolkit that has it's own Windows message loop. I'm simply using glfw for offscreen OpenGL for video post processing. The post processing effect is an optional piece of our software which is why I don't want to just call glfwInit on startup which would eliminate the problem. \n\nThe problem with _glfwPlatformPollEvents being called in glfwInit is that we may end up calling this while we have multiple video streams being received and displayed. While all of this is going on if there is heavy enough load then the Windows message queue may never be emptied and therefor glfwInit will never actually return until all of the messages are processed. I'd really rather there not be a message loop inside glfwInit, but if there must be it would be nice if it exited after it got the particular message it's looking for. In my case I don't see it ever doing anything in windowProc other than going to DefWindowProcW so I don't even think the poll is necessary at all, but I could be wrong.\n","closed_by":{"login":"elmindreda","id":133714,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMzcxNA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/133714?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda","html_url":"https://github.com/elmindreda","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/glfw/glfw/issues/886/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/glfw/glfw/issues/886/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
