!\n\nWhen window is maximized and not focused, glfwShowWindow changes focus but restores size of the window to the default (before maximized).\n\nwin32_window.c [ line 1155]\n\n```\nvoid _glfwPlatformShowWindow(_GLFWwindow* window)\n{\n    ShowWindow(window->win32.handle, SW_SHOWNORMAL);\n```\n\nfrom MSDN:\n\nSW_SHOWNORMAL\n\nActivates and displays a window. If the window is minimized or maximized, the system restores it to its original size and position. An application should specify this flag when displaying the window for the first time.\n\nSW_SHOW\n\nActivates the window and displays it in its current size and position.\n\nSo maybe there should be SW_SHOW insted of SW_SHOWNORMAL in the code above ? Or some statement that would determine if the show is invoked first time for that window and use SW_SHOWNORMAL once (?).\n","closed_by":{"login":"elmindreda","id":133714,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMzcxNA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/133714?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda","html_url":"https://github.com/elmindreda","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/glfw/glfw/issues/264/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/glfw/glfw/issues/264/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
