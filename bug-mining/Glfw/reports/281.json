3.3.1 throws the following error from `glfwPollEvents()` on my wayland+sway system:\r\n\r\n```\r\nX Error of failed request:  BadWindow (invalid Window parameter)\r\n  Major opcode of failed request:

problem to commit fe57e3c (2020-01-01).  The previous commit, 6b01aff (2020-01-01), works fine.  Both commits work okay under gnome3 though.\r\n\r\nI read [somewhere](https://www.gitmemory.com/issue/glfw/glfw/1620/572231113) that this problem might be related to running a tiling window manager with no window decorations, but I tested both with and without window decorations and in my case fe57e3c doesn't work either way.  \r\n\r\nHere's my test code:\r\n\r\n```c\r\n#include <stdio.h>\r\n#include <GLFW/glfw3.h>\r\n\r\nvoid quit(GLFWwindow *window, int key, int scancode, int action, int mods)\r\n{\r\n    if (key == GLFW_KEY_ESCAPE && action == GLFW_PRESS) {\r\n        glfwSetWindowShouldClose(window, GLFW_TRUE);\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\nvoid error_callback(int code, const char* description)\r\n{\r\n    printf(\"error: %s\\n\", description);\r\n}\r\n\r\nint main()\r\n{\r\n    glfwInit();\r\n\r\n    glfwWindowHint(GLFW_CONTEXT_VERSION_MAJOR, 3);\r\n    glfwWindowHint(GLFW_CONTEXT_VERSION_MINOR, 3);\r\n    glfwWindowHint(GLFW_OPENGL_PROFILE, GLFW_OPENGL_CORE_PROFILE);\r\n    glfwWindowHint(GLFW_OPENGL_FORWARD_COMPAT, GL_TRUE);\r\n    GLFWwindow *window = glfwCreateWindow(1280, 720, \"GLFW OpenGL\", NULL, NULL);\r\n    glfwMakeContextCurrent(window);\r\n\r\n    glfwSetErrorCallback(error_callback);\r\n    glfwSetKeyCallback(window, quit);\r\n\r\n    while (!glfwWindowShouldClose(window)) {\r\n\t\r\n\tprintf(\"polling events...\\n\");\r\n\r\n        glfwPollEvents();\r\n\r\n\tprintf(\"polled events\\n\");\r\n\r\n        glfwSwapBuffers(window);\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    glfwDestroyWindow(window);\r\n    glfwTerminate();\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote that `error_callback` isn't invoked, and `glfwPollEvent()` doesn't return; the program just aborts. \r\n\r\n```\r\nos: NixOS, kernel 4.19.98, sway 1.4\r\n```","closed_by":{"login":"elmindreda","id":133714,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMzcxNA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/133714?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda","html_url":"https://github.com/elmindreda","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/glfw/glfw/issues/1633/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/glfw/glfw/issues/1633/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
