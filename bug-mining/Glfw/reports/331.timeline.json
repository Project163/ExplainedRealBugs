to the glfw error handler should not be fatal.\r\nHowever an `assert(false)` in a debug build essentially makes it fatal - this can be very confusing.\r\n\r\nI ran into this issue on macOS 10.15.7.\r\nWhen AirPlay is used on macOS, GLFW will actually cause a warning (?) via the glfw error callback.\r\nThis would trigger the assertion, which would lead to exiting of the glfw platform demo.\r\nI've also reported this problem to GLFW: https://github.com/glfw/glfw/issues/1791 to fix the root issue eventually.\r\n\r\nWith the assertion removed, the demo will work as expected, even if airplay is currently being used.\r\n\r\nI assume that it's probably enough to report \"errors\" to `mbgl::Log`. Actual glfw errors should probably be handled when the glfw calls return unsuccessfully.\r\nI assume it will take some time until upstream glfw resolves this \"airplay is an error\", and even longer until the fix is widely deployed. Hence the decision to remove the assertion.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n*(It would be nice if you can tag this PR for hacktoberfest inclusion as described in https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/details#rules

where I rebuild the precompiled dependency libs first:\r\n1) git clone https://github.com/DaltonLens/DaltonLens.git\r\n2) go to cd DaltonLens/deps/\r\n3) ./update_dependencies_prebuilt_binaries.sh\r\n-> build looks like success and git status shows some libs are changed.\r\n3) open DaltonLens/DaltonLens/macOS/DaltonLens.xcodeproj in Xcode 13.2.1\r\n4) change all Signings (in DaltonLensLaunchAtLoginHelper as well as in DaltonLens) from your certificate to my own certificate\r\n5) just build all I could find (DaltonLensLaunchAtLoginHelper, DaltonLens, Dalton and DaltonTool) as Universal Binary (Intel + ARM)\r\n-> All builds clam to be successful with only warnings but no errors\r\n6) go to 'Products' in Xcode project tree and right click to \"show in Finder\"\r\n-> I start DaltonLens.app with double click and after a short moment an error message pops up that application was closed unexpected and under details there is a crash log.\r\n\r\nCould be the missing DaltonTool (at least I could not find it in the folder where the app is created and Xcode shows it in red) the reason? Or maybe it is not running under Big Sur and or M1 ? Or did I use wrong Xcode version?\r\n\r\nI actually did a very old fork of DaltonLens around 2018 and experiment with it a little bit on my own (especially with the Daltonize Correction for protanomaly). This old fork I can still build on M1 and Bid Sur with the mentioned Xcode. But since then you have changed a ton of stuff and I wanted to try my experiments on your newest version.\r\nI just repeat compiling my old for Universal binary. Here I even find the fresh compiled \"DaltonTool\" binary in the Products folder and the fresh compiled DaltonLens.app runs without a
