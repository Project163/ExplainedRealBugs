Joystick[0]/GLFW_JOYSTICK_1 should always represent the first joystick enumerated by the system.  With hidromancer, xpad (kernel) and xboxdrv, the driver reserves a block of devices and assigns the each physical device that connects to it the next available js\\* device within the block in ascending order.\n\nSo, for example, if you connect a usb xbox receiver, 4 devices become exposed to a GLFW application.  As far as GLFW can see all the devices are valid, but the user probably only has one controller connected.  If the enumeration is inverted and the application assigns GLFW_JOYSTICK_1 for, say, menu navigation.  The user would then have to connect 3 additional controllers to the receiver, using the 4th, in order to 'be' player one.\n\nMaking a case for literal mapping is a little trickier, but I think it's best that input API's expose the functions of the driver/hw as directly as possible with regard to crossplatform uniformity.  This is one of the reasons that I prefer GLFW to SDL and SFML.  SDL makes some ridiculous assumptions and implements them with dirty hacks (axis remapping and obscuration) which break a the uniform model.  SFML obtusely limits all hardware on all platforms to the worst joystick api on them all (mmsystem.)\n\nIf I create a udev joystick device under linux with axes 0-20 enabled, GLFW exposes all the axes without trying to second-guess the intent of the driver.  Through GLFW all axes are available and enumerated just as the driver provided them.  To me this is the only sane behaviour, since only the driver knows how the hardware works.  It's not much of a jump to apply the same principals to device enumeration as to axis/button enumeration.\n\nAnother good case for literal mapping of OS enumerated devices might be hotplugging.  The onus is already on the OS to handle the enumeration of devices as they are connected and lost in no predictable order.  We already have to consider this a reliable subsystem, and in the case of linux, the I've found the behaviour of udev to be simple and reliable.\n\nI think the case of having index 'holes' on init will be somewhat uncommon.  This is only expected to happen when, say, player1 disconnects, but player2 remains.  This might be because batteries are being swapped out, in which case, reconnecting the device will restore it to the first available index anyway.  Hidromancer has a mechanism to selectively change to any available udev vport with a block, but otherwise, the behaviour would be consistent with OS enum and most (if not all) consoles.\n","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/glfw/glfw/issues/comments/164306376/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"ghost","id":10137,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMTM3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10137?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost","html_url":"https://github.com/ghost","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/glfw/glfw/issues/comments/164307768","html_url":"https://github.com/glfw/glfw/issues/654#issuecomment-164307768","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/glfw/glfw/issues/654","id":164307768,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE2NDMwNzc2OA==","user":{"login":"elmindreda","id":133714,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMzcxNA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/133714?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda","html_url":"https://github.com/elmindreda","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-12-13T22:52:44Z","updated_at":"2015-12-13T22:52:44Z","body":"Ah, you want it because the USB Xbox receiver driver lies.

Thanks!\n\nI would like to point out again, however, this is not endemically an xbox receiver issue.  It has nothing to do with drivers or hardware lying, per se.  I have 3 Logitech  F710 Gamepads, each connects to their own USB port.  If I connect them one at a time, the third one I connect (which is /dev/input/js2) still ends up being recognized by GLFW as GLFW_JOYSTICK_1.  In this case there are no device nodes being block-reserved -- just one gamepad, one USB port, one driver instance, one device node each.\n\nThere always exists the possibility of holes in the enum, depending on when a device is lost.  Since, again, the OS bears the onus of enumerating, it still seems to me to best to trust the OS to handle it, rather than reimplement the wheel.\n\nI actually really like using GLFW for input becuase it properly exposes the driver as a flat list of buttons and axes without performing any dirty hacks.  Now... am I misunderstanding this, or is the next version you mentioned going to essentially overwrite the driver defined axis/button enum and break the flat model?\n","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/glfw/glfw/issues/comments/164607539/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"ghost","id":10137,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMTM3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10137?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost","html_url":"https://github.com/ghost","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/glfw/glfw/issues/comments/164608900","html_url":"https://github.com/glfw/glfw/issues/654#issuecomment-164608900","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/glfw/glfw/issues/654","id":164608900,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE2NDYwODkwMA==","user":{"login":"elmindreda","id":133714,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMzcxNA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/133714?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda","html_url":"https://github.com/elmindreda","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-12-15T01:04:54Z","updated_at":"2015-12-15T01:04:54Z","body":"I understand that it's not specific to your receiver device and that the bug applied to any set of more than one joystick.\n\nI know that holes are unavoidable once you start plugging things out, but due to a sentence in the GLFW API spec I need the initial set to be packed.\n\nThe remapping will _only_ apply to a specific list of devices that I know will be expected to behave like an Xbox controller.
