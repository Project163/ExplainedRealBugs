and version: MacOS Catalina 10.15.7\r\nCommit ID: 3eaf1255b29fdf5c2895856c7be7d7185ef2b241\r\nError Messages: None\r\n\r\n(NOTE: This also happens on 3.3 stable) \r\n\r\nIn my game engine, when it creates a GLFW window, it does so in windowed mode to start with in case loading the main resource archive takes a long time. I then set the window fullscreen later if configured to do so, otherwise it stays windowed.\r\n\r\nOn MacOS Catalina however, even with GLFW_MOUSE_PASSTHROUGH set to false, (I don't set the hint in the first place but I tested this to check) the mouse \"clicks-through\" the window and minimizes it if the engine starts in fullscreen. This state remains even if I then bring the window up again from the dock. Sometimes if I use my game engine's fullscreen toggle a couple of times it correctly focuses the window.\r\n\r\nZooming the window with the green button instead of using glfwSetWindowMonitor is not affected. Windowed mode is not affected. \r\n\r\nBig Sur and Monterey to my knowledge are not affected by this bug.","closed_by":{"login":"elmindreda","id":133714,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMzcxNA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/133714?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda","html_url":"https://github.com/elmindreda","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/glfw/glfw/issues/2377/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/glfw/glfw/issues/2377/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
