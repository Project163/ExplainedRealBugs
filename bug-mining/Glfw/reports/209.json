returns the exact same key and scan codes regardless of whether num lock is on or off. This makes it impossible to distinguish between KP_7 and KP_HOME for example. \r\n\r\nAlso glfwGetKeyName() returns NULL for numpad keys. \r\n\r\nThe list of glfw keys should be extended to add KP_HOME, KP_END, KP_INS, KP_DEL, KP_PG_DN and KP_PG_UP and glfw should return the appropriate key depending on what the underlying window system reports.\r\n\r\nOn X11, for example, xev is able to distinguish between KP_7 and KP_HOME, reporting them correctly.
