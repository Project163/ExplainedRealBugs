using glfw3 on macOS Sierra, it seems both `FORWARD_COMPAT` **and** `CORE_PROFILE` have to be supplied as hints for GL >= 3.2\r\n\r\nConfusingly though, the absence of either produces a distinct error message, [as per the code here](https://github.com/glfw/glfw/blob/8d6f265441959d0eff2d3fd97edfb99b98ce2777/src/nsgl_context.m#L140)\r\n\r\n* Without forward compat you're told `NSGL: The targeted version of macOS only supports forward-compatible contexts for OpenGL 3.2 and above`\r\n* Without core profile you're told `NSGL: The targeted version of macOS only supports core profile contexts for OpenGL 3.2 and above`\r\n\r\nSo you effectively *have* to specify both. \r\n\r\nI don't know enough about GL caps on macOS to know if the actual logic of this check is correct - but even if it is, I think this check should be condensed into a single error message (i.e. 'You must use a forward-compatible core profile') as it is pretty confusing as it stands","closed_by":{"login":"elmindreda","id":133714,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMzcxNA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/133714?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda","html_url":"https://github.com/elmindreda","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/glfw/glfw/issues/904/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/glfw/glfw/issues/904/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
