is a place for figuring out what we need to do for the 3.3 release. As long as 3.3 hasn't been released there is still time to comment.\r\n\r\n### Things that will go into 3.3\r\nThese are what I (elmindreda) will focus on getting merged before starting on any of the other ones.\r\n- [x] Content scale queries (`glfwGet*ContentScale`) #235, #439 (implicitly), #676, #677, #845, #898\r\n- [x] Joystick axis fixes (XInput y-axis, ~IOHID x-axis~) #1083 \r\n  - very little work\r\n- [x] Full window opacity (`GLFW_OPACITY`) #1089\r\n  - little work\r\n- [x] Lock key query (`glfwGetKeyLock`) #946\r\n  - little work, all platforms\r\n- [x] Gamepad mapping modifiers\r\n  - little work\r\n\r\n### Things that could go into 3.3\r\nMost of these are relatively isolated and can be done without much coordination, the one major exception being joystick state callbacks. If you want to take on one of them then please leave a comment below so we can avoid duplicate work. Also, in many cases there is already a work-in-progress branch, some of them already on GitHub. I'll start pushing the remaining ones as soon as I'm able.\r\n\r\nIf you are waiting for one of these features but would prefer that 3.3 not be delayed for it, please leave a comment. Also, if you have no personal interest in a feature but think it's worth delaying the release for it, please leave a comment and (optionally) explain why.\r\n\r\n- ~[ ] Joystick state callbacks (`glfwSetJoystick*Callback`) #601 (half of), #856~\r\n  - some work, all platforms, intersects with event time\r\n- ~[ ] Joystick state query (`glfwGetJoystickState`, `GLFWjoystickstate`) #601 (half of)~\r\n  - little work, shared code only\r\n- ~Event time (`glfwGetEventTime`) #1012~\r\n- ~EGLDevice backend (no API change) #786~\r\n- ~[ ] Disable screensaver via libdbus (no API change) #854~\r\n  - some work, Unix only\r\n- ~Native handle attachment (function name needed) #25~\r\n- ~IME functions (pre-edit event, pre-edit window position, IME toggle) #41, #658~\r\n- [x] macOS window occlusion (design needed) #680 \r\n  - unknown amount of work\r\n\r\nThere are also many very valuable ways to contribute other than making feature PRs.\r\n\r\nI know some of you are very familiar with the internals and conventions of GLFW. You could team up with and mentor someone new to the project who is taking on one of the above features and get the PR from promising to ready to merge.\r\n\r\nDocumentation bug reports and PRs are always welcome. There has been a lot of documentation added or changed since the last release. There will be mistakes in it, as well as awkward phrasings and poor explanations. The compilation and build guides are especially terrible and could use both improvements, expansion and (especially for the GUI parts) lots of images (default system DPI, default UI theme).\r\n\r\n~The Doxygen custom CSS needs to be updated since Doxygen broke tons of the current one in a recent release. Most importantly the colors of the new dynamic menus. This one doesn't have an issue so open one if you're taking this on.~ Done by @siavashserver in #1100 \r\n\r\nIs your project using GLFW? Are you still using 3.2.1 or earlier? Try running it on 3.3 and see if everything works. If not, please open an issue ASAP.\r\n\r\nDo you have any joysticks or controllers laying around? There have been major changes to the macOS joystick backend, the Linux one has been replaced entirely and the SDL_gamecontrollerdb support needs all the testing it can get.\r\n\r\nSince we just added a new parser with `glfwUpdateGamepadMappings`, run fuzzers against it and report or fix any bugs they find.\r\n\r\nMeta-contributions: suggest new suggestions for this
