on our forums in post [Maximising Window differences from 3.2 to 3.3 ](http://discourse.glfw.org/t/maximising-window-differences-from-3-2-to-3-3/1338).\r\n\r\nI have confirmed the issue and have a fix in testing which I'll create a PR for shortly, however this turns out to be a slightly complex and subtle area.\r\n\r\n**Details**\r\n\r\nWhen the window hint GLFW_MAXIMIZED is set to GLFW_TRUE and a window is created it appears with maximized style but not with a maximized size.\r\n\r\nIt should instead appear maximized as well as in the maximized style.\r\n\r\n**Notes**\r\n\r\nRelated to issue
