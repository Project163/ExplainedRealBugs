code in win32_window.c:\r\n```\r\nvoid _glfwPlatformShowWindow(_GLFWwindow* window)\r\n{\r\n    ShowWindow(window->win32.handle, SW_SHOW);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nI believe should be:\r\n```\r\nvoid _glfwPlatformShowWindow(_GLFWwindow* window)\r\n{\r\n    ShowWindow(window->win32.handle, SW_SHOWNA);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nRight now if you call `glfwCreateWindow()` with the `GLFW_FOCUSED` hint set to FALSE, the code in glfwCreateWindow does:\r\n```\r\n_glfwPlatformShowWindow(window);\r\nif (wndconfig.focused)\r\n    _glfwPlatformFocusWindow(window);\r\n```\r\nAnd _glfwPlatformShowWindow() alone with SW_SHOW \"activates\" the Windows. Now honestly, I am confused about the exact meaning of \"activation\" in the Win32 api but essentially it looks like we are losing the focus, and this defeat the purpose of GLFW_FOCUSED as documented:  `GLFW_FOCUSED specifies whether the windowed mode window will be given input focus when created. This hint is ignored for full screen and initially hidden windows. `\r\n\r\nI will post a PR shortly to make it easy to test that change. I think it should probably be checked/confirmed by people who are more expert of the Win32 api that I am. \r\n\r\n(PS/1: My usage context is I am trying to get this feature working in my GLFW backends: https://twitter.com/ocornut/status/950430111710482433 / the code create undecorated window dynamically and it is a problem and overly noticeable by the end-user if the parent window lose its focus.)\r\n\r\n(PS/2: Out of curiosity I traced the history for `_glfwPlatformShowWindow()`: \r\nMay 2014: b91116e2bc8e1abe83b2f486b9cb9b1f0fc1109b Changed `SW_SHOWNORMAL` to `SW_SHOW` for #264\r\nJan 2013: b72a97d5318ca497224739411d806bc4b217cc0d Refactor, didn't affect functionalities\r\nAug 2012, 596132c3a1becceb0ba6d10991d52a85ba8f201c Initial version)\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nB)\r\nNote that my proposed PR only fixes glfwCreateWindow().\r\n`glfwShowWindow()` always calls `_glfwPlatformShowWindow` + `_glfwPlatformFocusWindow`, which seems redundant with the the fact that `glfwFocusWindow()` exists. \r\nMy intuition it that it would it be more correct and consistent to remove that call to `_glfwPlatformFocusWindow()` in `glfwShowWindow()`, however: that extra call was added in 89f438de5a862802717a5d6e32ebfe462775cccf \"Fix window focus regression\" (March 2016) so I imagine there is more to it.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThank you very much.\r\nO.\r\n  ","closed_by":{"login":"elmindreda","id":133714,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMzcxNA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/133714?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda","html_url":"https://github.com/elmindreda","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/glfw/glfw/issues/1179/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/glfw/glfw/issues/1179/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
