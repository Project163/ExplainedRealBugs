 I am working on OS X 10.9.5, glfw was installed through brew which reports version \"stable 3.0.4\".\n\nThe title says pretty much all. I am using the window title to display basic textual information, so making a call to glfwSetWindowTitle() each frame. This call does not change the title --which remains at the value set by glfwCreateWindow()-- unless I also call glfwPollEvents().\nSince I do not see an entry in glfwSetWindowTitle() documentation requiring to call the poll method, am I right to assume it is a bug ?\n\nFYI: The glfwPollEvents() fix was found here: https://www.opengl.org/discussion_boards/showthread.php/176229-glfwSetWindowTitle-not-working-for-me?p=1230516&viewfull=1#post1230516\n\nThank you for taking the time to read this issue and maintain this project !\n","closed_by":{"login":"elmindreda","id":133714,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMzcxNA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/133714?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda","html_url":"https://github.com/elmindreda","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/glfw/glfw/issues/495/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/glfw/glfw/issues/495/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
