current methods of setting WM_CLASS are:\r\n\r\n1) Use the title set a creation time. Does not allow setting the name and class parts of WM_CLASS\r\n2) Use an init hint. Does nto allow setting different WM_CLASS for different windows in the same application.\r\n\r\nMy proposed method addresses both od these shortcomings, by encoding the WM_CLASS and title values into a single string demarcated by ASCII start-of-header and record separator bytes (which do not occur in the utf-8 encoding). If the title does not start with start-of-header, the old behavior from (1) is used.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/glfw/glfw/issues/1139/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/glfw/glfw/issues/1139/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"actor":{"login":"s-ol","id":1731279,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MzEyNzk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1731279?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/s-ol","html_url":"https://github.com/s-ol","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s-ol/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s-ol/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s-ol/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s-ol/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s-ol/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s-ol/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s-ol/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s-ol/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s-ol/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-09-23T10:21:28Z","updated_at":"2018-09-23T10:21:28Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ocornut/imgui/issues/1542","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ocornut/imgui","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ocornut/imgui/issues/1542/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ocornut/imgui/issues/1542/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ocornut/imgui/issues/1542/events","html_url":"https://github.com/ocornut/imgui/issues/1542","id":286874781,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWUyODY4NzQ3ODE=","number":1542,"title":"Multi-viewports

Use the 'docking' branch to test multi-viewports.\r\n\r\n## December 2019: See Glossary: https://github.com/ocornut/imgui/wiki/Glossary#multi-viewports-terms\r\n\r\nJanuary 2020: If you want to implement multi-viewports in your custom engine, the easiest path is to read the comment around `ImGuiPlatformIO` along with the bottom sections of e.g. imgui_impl_glfw+imgui_impl_opengl3 to learn from it. \r\n\r\n## For Linux/Mac specific issues please post in #2117.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nCreating this thread to discuss and tag commits related to an upcoming feature. \r\n\r\nIt somehow relates to Docking (#2109) in the sense that current work on docking created growing expectations to get this working. But it's also mostly separate code, and for various reasons I think this will probably go in master before Docking. It will need testing and feedback.\r\n\r\nIf you follow the Docking thread you may have seen this already: [...]\r\nAnd more recently I improved transition and it's somewhat magical:\r\n![imgui_platform_20180108](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8225057/34685569-16309c5e-f4a9-11e7-9147-3dc23e083437.gif)\r\n\r\nWhat happens here essentially if that the code creates borderless (undecorated) windows with a dedicated DirectX/OpenGL context on the fly, create imgui viewport to cover this os window, and move the window there..\r\n\r\nBasically it consist in two parts:\r\n- dear imgui will support a new concept called \"viewport\". A single imgui context can drive multiple virtualized regions, as shown in those GIF. Using a single context makes sharing state natural (things like settings, tree nodes state or cross windows drag and drop). There are still various problems to solve related to persistence, mouse position, etc. but overall it's not a crazily complex feature.\r\n\r\n- To support this feature the backend code (imgui_impl_xxxx files) needs to be reworked obviously. It puts additional complexity on that code and not all engine will support it. That part needs to be both optional and as out of the way possible. I suspect we will need to iterate on that a lot, both to get the functionalities right, and because I worry a lot about the imgui first-time user experience and impression, and the additional complexity is very undesirable there. \r\nI suspect I may end up re-factoring a lot of the examples/ code.\r\n\r\nIf you are interested I will be looking for feedback and early adopters, hopefully starting in January some of this can be in a branch.\r\n\r\n
