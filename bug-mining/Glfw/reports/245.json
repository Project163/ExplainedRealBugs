screen working area is the desktop area of the display, excluding taskbars, docked windows, and docked tool bars. \r\n\r\nIn windows you get it with (using System.Windows.Forms):\r\n\r\n`Screen::WorkingArea`\r\n\r\nhttps://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.windows.forms.screen.workingarea\r\n\r\nIn java you get it by subtracting screen insets from screen dimensions for each screen since not all screens have these items on them:\r\n\r\n` Toolkit.getDefaultToolkit().getScreenInsets(graphicsConfiguration)`\r\n\r\nI don't know how Java gets them for OSX but it does somehow, possibly someone who knows something about OSX can chime in.\r\n\r\nEither method, getting the working area directly, or getting insets and subtracting from screen space works fine, but right now there is no way in GLFW, that I could find, to get this space.\r\n\r\nOne reason this is necessary is that right now GLFW does not maximize correctly when maximizing a window with no decorations. Instead of taking up the working area when `glfwMaximizeWindow()` is called it takes up the entire screen (the function works fine for a decorated window). I don't know if that was the intended behavior or not, so I'm not calling it a bug, but the developer needs to be able to decide which behavior they want for undecorated windows as well.\r\n\r\nThere are other reasons why having the working area is necessary especially for things like floating windows for notifications or other widgets. Generally you want those to not cover the task bar, but you don't want them to be decorated.","closed_by":{"login":"elmindreda","id":133714,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMzcxNA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/133714?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda","html_url":"https://github.com/elmindreda","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/glfw/glfw/issues/920/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/glfw/glfw/issues/920/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
