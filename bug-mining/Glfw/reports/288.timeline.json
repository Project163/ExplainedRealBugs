patch has the implementation for querying the work area on X11 and Windows.\r\n\r\n- **The X11 implementation**. I believe everything is done with this implementation. I tested with single monitor, but since the monitor is passed directly to the function, I don't think there will be any problem with it.\r\n\r\n- **The Windows implementation**. This implementation surely needs test on multiple monitors. I tested with a single monitor, and the work area retrieved was correct. However, we need to make sure that the ```HMONITOR``` that we grab the information from matches the ```_GLFWmonitor``` passed to the function.\r\n\r\n- **The Cocoa implementation**. The implementation for Cocoa is a draft and needs to be test and reviewed.\r\n\r\nThis patch is related to the issue

is an implementation for window transparency for mouse events requested in #1236. There are some things to discuss before merging.\r\n\r\n`GLFW_MOUSE_PASSTHRU` define and `mousePassthru` variable. I used terminology suggested in #1236. Naming is hard so if anyone has a better idea - speak up. Maybe we shuld do `PASSTHRU` -> `PASSTHROUGH` at least.\r\n\r\nIs `GLFW_MOUSE_PASSTHRU` defined in appropriate place and is it's value proper?\r\n\r\nI tried to add documentation comments but i did so without fully understanding what i am doing. In case anything is missing/incorrect please let me know.\r\n\r\n`libXext.so.6` - hope that \".6\" is pretty much same across all distributions. I may be wrong.\r\n\r\nCYGWIN - untested. Only reason why it would break is `libXext-6.so` being named something else i think.\r\n\r\nNot sure if i got all `_glfw.x11.xshape` right.\r\n\r\nWayland while i think is implemented correctly - does not work. I tested with gears example, setting `glfwWindowHint(GLFW_MOUSE_PASSTHRU, GLFW_TRUE);` before window creation. It may be that kwin compositor does not have required bits for this to work. If anyone runs Gnome wayland - i would greatly appreciate if you could test this PR. Otherwise i may get around to setting up a VM for a test, but i would love to avoid it if possible.\r\n\r\nX11/Windows/MacOS - everything works as

Expected behavior of the wanted feature\r\n\r\nThere’s already `--no-input-default-bindings` for ignoring all keyboard & mouse events, but I couldn’t find anything that would allow you to click/scroll/etc. through the mpv window so that the input event would be received by whatever application is **below** the mpv window. `--input-cursor=no` also exists, but this only hides the cursor when it’s over the mpv window.\r\n\r\nUse case: I’d like to overlay subtitles for audio-only streams and keep them visible all the time. I can already achieve this pretty nicely with `--no-video --force-window=yes --alpha=yes --background=\"#00000000\" --border=no --ontop=yes --osc=no --window-dragging=no` and setting the window geometry to something fitting. This way subtitles are the only thing that’s visible in the mpv window, and they stay visible on top of other windows, but there’s still the annoyance of having an area where I can’t interact with what’s below the mpv window. I’ve tried to optimize the geometry to keep the window as small as possible, but unfortunately there needs to be a decent amount of width and height for all subtitles to fit, and sometimes there are 4+ lines of text visible at the same time.\r\n\r\nI’m using Fedora on Gnome 3.36 (both X11 and Wayland available).\r\n\r\nIf this functionality is already available in mpv, please point me to the right direction and close the issue.
