have also encountered this issue.  GLFW (3.0.2) detects the joystick (a Logitech Extreme 3D), but does not identify its axes or buttons.  I've done some digging and the problem arises because the code in _glfwInitJoysticks (cocoa_joystick.m) for enumerating the HID elements of the joystick only gets a single array element (representing the \"root\" of the device).  That element is an \"Application Collection\" (kIOHIDElementCollectionTypeApplication), which is represented by a dictionary.  The function addJoystickElement expects it to have an kIOHIDElementKey field (which would be the children elements), but it does not, so the axis and button elements are not detected.\n\nI don't know if this situation is because of a bug in Apple's code for enumerating the elements of the device or in GLFW's query.  I did notice that Apple's sample code (e.g., HID_Dumper) uses a different set of library function from IOHIDLib.h for enumerating HID devices and elements of those devices.\n","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/glfw/glfw/issues/comments/24008413/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"JohnReppy","id":5407038,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0MDcwMzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5407038?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JohnReppy","html_url":"https://github.com/JohnReppy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JohnReppy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JohnReppy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JohnReppy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JohnReppy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JohnReppy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JohnReppy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JohnReppy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JohnReppy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JohnReppy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/glfw/glfw/issues/comments/24009432","html_url":"https://github.com/glfw/glfw/issues/78#issuecomment-24009432","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/glfw/glfw/issues/78","id":24009432,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI0MDA5NDMy","user":{"login":"JohnReppy","id":5407038,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0MDcwMzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5407038?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JohnReppy","html_url":"https://github.com/JohnReppy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JohnReppy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JohnReppy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JohnReppy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JohnReppy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JohnReppy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JohnReppy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JohnReppy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JohnReppy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JohnReppy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2013-09-07T20:50:01Z","updated_at":"2013-09-07T20:50:01Z","body":"I have a patch to cocoa_joystick.m that fixes the problem (at least for my controller).
