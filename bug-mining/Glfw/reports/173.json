just implemented camera movements and noticed that the camera moved forward for a bit after releasing W. After some investigation I noticed that glfwSetKeyCallback triggered another shorter sequence of GLFW_PRESS, GLFW_REPEAT and GLFW_RELEASE after I've release the key. The longer I hold the key the longer the second sequence is.\n\nTo make sure it wasn't something in my code I downloaded the getting started example and added a simple `printf(\"%i  \", action);`\n\nThe output looked like this:\n\n`1 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 0 1 2 2 2 2 0`\n\nWhere the first 0 is when I actually released the key and the rest of the sequence are phantom key events.\n\nI'm running GLFW 3.1.2 using the offical package on ArchLinux x64\n","closed_by":{"login":"elmindreda","id":133714,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMzcxNA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/133714?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda","html_url":"https://github.com/elmindreda","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/glfw/glfw/issues/747/reactions","total_count":3,"+1":3,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/glfw/glfw/issues/747/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
