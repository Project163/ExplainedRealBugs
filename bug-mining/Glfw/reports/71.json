to reproduce this issue are:\n1. Launch the `events` test.\n2. Hold down a key (for example, caps lock, any key will do).\n3. Use a keyboard shortcut to switch desktops (e.g. ctrl+alt+arrow down).\n   - The window doesn't lose focus, maybe a bug?\n4. Release the key.\n   - The application doesn't ever see this.\n5. Switch back to the screen with the `events` test on it.\n   - The window still has focus.\n6. Press another key.\n   - BUG: The application still thinks the keys (caps lock+ctrl+alt).\n\nFor reference, the `events` test logs the following during this:\n\n```\nstephen@stephen-laptop:~/Desktop/glfw/tests$ ./events \nLibrary initialized\nCreating windowed mode window 1 (640x480)\nMain loop starting\n00000000 to 1 at 0.044: Window position: 65 24\n00000001 to 1 at 0.046: Window refresh\n00000002 to 1 at 0.067: Window focused\n00000003 to 1 at 0.069: Window was restored\n00000004 to 1 at 0.069: Window position: 65 52\n00000005 to 1 at 0.069: Window refresh\n00000006 to 1 at 0.070: Window refresh\n00000007 to 1 at 1.194: Key 0x0118 Scancode 0x0042 (CAPS LOCK) (with no mods) was pressed\n00000008 to 1 at 2.099: Key 0x0155 Scancode 0x0025 (LEFT CONTROL) (with no mods) was pressed\n00000009 to 1 at 2.152: Key 0x0156 Scancode 0x0040 (LEFT ALT) (with control) was pressed\n0000000a to 1 at 3.327: Window position: 65 -716\n0000000b to 1 at 7.763: Window position: 1431 -716\n0000000c to 1 at 8.105: Window position: 1431 52\n0000000d to 1 at 10.816: Window position: 1431 -716\n0000000e to 1 at 10.995: Window position: 65 -716\n0000000f to 1 at 11.838: Window position: 65 52\n00000010 to 1 at 20.177: Key 0x0041 Scancode 0x0026 (A) (with no mods) was pressed\n00000011 to 1 at 20.177: Character 0x00000041 (A) with modifiers (with no mods) input\n00000012 to 1 at 20.177: Character 0x00000041 (A) input\n00000013 to 1 at 20.276: Key 0x0041 Scancode 0x0026 (A) (with no mods) was released\n00000014 to 1 at 25.345: Window close\n```\n- Ubuntu 14.04 / unity 7.2.3.\n","closed_by":{"login":"elmindreda","id":133714,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMzcxNA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/133714?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda","html_url":"https://github.com/elmindreda","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/glfw/glfw/issues/405/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/glfw/glfw/issues/405/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
