If no character is entered in notepad, then no character should occur in GLFW.\n\nI agree with that. Except it should do that on Windows/OS X/Linux accordingly. Perhaps this depends on region setting, making it harder and inconsistent.\n\nI've seen Alt as a possible key modifier (i.e. alt+key = results in an alternate character), but never Control or Super. Perhaps it is possible under some configurations, I just haven't seen it.\n\nIf the above cannot be implemented within GLFW, then passing modifier flag along with the key input is the only sane alternative that will support all input needs (basically, by pushing the problem upwards for the user application to handle).\n","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/glfw/glfw/issues/comments/31503571/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"dmitshur","id":1924134,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5MjQxMzQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1924134?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmitshur","html_url":"https://github.com/dmitshur","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmitshur/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmitshur/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmitshur/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmitshur/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmitshur/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmitshur/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmitshur/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmitshur/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmitshur/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/glfw/glfw/issues/comments/31746469","html_url":"https://github.com/glfw/glfw/issues/203#issuecomment-31746469","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/glfw/glfw/issues/203","id":31746469,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMxNzQ2NDY5","user":{"login":"wintertime","id":6032572,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYwMzI1NzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6032572?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wintertime","html_url":"https://github.com/wintertime","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wintertime/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wintertime/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wintertime/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wintertime/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wintertime/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wintertime/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wintertime/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wintertime/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wintertime/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-01-07T15:26:17Z","updated_at":"2014-01-07T15:31:04Z","body":"I guess you are using a US-keyboard?

is needed to correctly and **_reliably_** distinguish character events from mod+key combinations, due to the change in #40.\n\nSee the relevant discussion [here](https://github.com/glfw/glfw/commit/9c20737b60037dbbda5552a45b5af9e1314cc701#commitcomment-4744485) for context of why this is needed, and why there is no possible way to have fully reliable character input with the current API (if there is, I'd love to be corrected).\n\nBefore:\n\n```\n0000001b to 1 at 3.602: Key 0x0058 Scancode 0x0007 (X) (with super) was pressed\n0000001c to 1 at 3.602: Character 0x00000078 (x) input\n0000001d to 1 at 3.742: Key 0x0058 Scancode 0x0007 (X) (with super) was released\n```\n\nThere was no way to reliably ignore the x character input when Cmd+X (shortcut for Cut) is pressed.\n\nAfter:\n\n```\n0000001b to 1 at 3.602: Key 0x0058 Scancode 0x0007 (X) (with super) was pressed\n0000001c to 1 at 3.602: Character 0x00000078 (x) (with super) input\n0000001d to 1 at 3.742: Key 0x0058 Scancode 0x0007 (X) (with super) was released\n```\n\nNow it's easy to ignore the character x from being typed when the user presses

WM_SYSCHAR) but not when CTRL modified is pressed. Making it hard for an application to process shortcuts (e.g. CTRL+S) while relying on translated characters.\n\nI have looked into it, surprising enough it appears that it is a bit of a pain to retrieve this information under Windows.\n\nAdding this at the end of message handler for keys messages appears to fix it, albeit in a rather ugly way:\n\n```\n        case WM_KEYDOWN:\n        case WM_SYSKEYDOWN:\n        case WM_KEYUP:\n        case WM_SYSKEYUP:\n[...]\n            if ((uMsg == WM_KEYDOWN || uMsg == WM_SYSKEYDOWN) && (mods & GLFW_MOD_CONTROL))\n            {\n                static BYTE keys[256] = { 0 };\n                WCHAR buf[4];\n                int buf_sz;\n                int n;\n                keys[VK_SHIFT] = (mods & GLFW_MOD_SHIFT) ? 0x80 : 0;\n                buf_sz = ToUnicodeEx(wParam, scancode, keys, buf, 4, 0, NULL);\n                for (n = 0; n < buf_sz; n++)\n                    _glfwInputChar(window, buf[n], getKeyMods(), FALSE);\n            }\n\n            break;\n```\n\nAs I understand it, DefWindowProc generates WM_CHAR / WM_SYSCHAR messages from WM_KEYDOWN / WM_SYSKEYDOWN messages, and code above replicated the effect for me. It looks a little dodgy but I haven't spotted a flaw with it yet. \n\nIt might fail on certain edge cases (I don't know them) but I am tempted to say that it can't be a regression since currently we get nothing under Windows when CTRL is held. \n\n(With Microsoft IME active when holding is doesn't popup anyway so I typically get the Latin character in this case, which is desirable)\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/glfw/glfw/issues/672/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/glfw/glfw/issues/672/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
