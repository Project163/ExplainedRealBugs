using Arch Linux, and been having problems with setting up Ikemen-Go to use my DS4 controller.\r\nFirst of all, I can't change the controller configuration through the in-game joystick config GUI as it doesn't capture any input from my controller, making me unable to edit it.\r\nTo fix this, I had to use `jstest` to get the ID number of each button and then manually map it to the config.json file. This also had problems since I couldn't figure out the ID numbers for the joystick and the D-Pad as they're axis, not buttons. Strangely enough the only movement I could get was moving left, by pressing Up on the D-Pad.\r\nThen I decided to just add the game to my steam library as a non-steam game and use its built-in controller remapping, mapping each button and axis to a keyboard key.\r\nThis works, but it's not perfect nor
