calls to `glfwGetJoystickButtons` and `glfwGetJoystickAxes`, `count` is always 0. I have the following code, which I believe is correct:\n\n``` c++\nfor (int i=GLFW_JOYSTICK_1; i <= GLFW_JOYSTICK_LAST; ++i) {\n    if (glfwJoystickPresent(i) == GL_TRUE) {\n        int nbuttons, naxes;\n        const unsigned char *pressed = glfwGetJoystickButtons(i, &nbuttons);\n        const float *axes = glfwGetJoystickAxes(i, &naxes);\n        printf(\"%d %d -- %p %p\\n\", nbuttons, naxes, pressed, axes);\n    }\n}\n```\n\nIt outputs `0 0 -- 0x100c239f0 0x100c264c0`, and this tells me that, even though GLFW didn't catch any errors, something weird is happening internally. I'm not familiar with the HID API, but I can debug this further if you need more information.\n\nHopefully, this isn't just me being stupid.\n\nSystem: OS X 10.8.2, AMD Radeon HD 6770M, Xbox 360 wired controller, latest GLFW 3.0.1 from github as of now.\n","closed_by":{"login":"elmindreda","id":133714,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMzcxNA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/133714?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda","html_url":"https://github.com/elmindreda","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/glfw/glfw/issues/78/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/glfw/glfw/issues/78/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
