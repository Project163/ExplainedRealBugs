cmake 3.15 \"CMAKE_MSVC_RUNTIME_LIBRARY\" was introduced to solve the problem that GLFW's USE_MSVC_RUNTIME_LIBRARY_DLL  addresses.\r\n\r\nCmake Documentation:\r\nhttps://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/release/3.15.html#variables\r\nhttps://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/variable/CMAKE_MSVC_RUNTIME_LIBRARY.html#variable:CMAKE_MSVC_RUNTIME_LIBRARY\r\n\r\nI propose 2 things.\r\n\r\n1.)\r\nIf the client is using cmake 3.15 or above then don't bother making this variable at all. It really only confuses things since the official cmake approach will override whatever GLFW does anyway. This creates unnecessary build complexity/confusion.\r\nSince users will have a cmake-gui option that doesn't do anything.\r\n\r\n2.)\r\nIf this variable continues to exist prefix it with GLFW_* to make it clear what project it belongs to. In cmake-gui/ccmake you can order cache variables by Groups (Groups essentially just be prefixes). You can see what I mean in the picture below.\r\n \r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/31327577/95607904-62f41680-0a2a-11eb-89f3-3702caaeed66.png)\r\n\r\nIn larger cmake projects, not using grouped entries confuses regular developers. Personally the first time I saw it, I thought it was part of cmake like BUILD_SHARED_LIBS.","closed_by":{"login":"elmindreda","id":133714,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMzcxNA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/133714?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda","html_url":"https://github.com/elmindreda","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/glfw/glfw/issues/1783/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/glfw/glfw/issues/1783/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
