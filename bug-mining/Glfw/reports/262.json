we resize a window on MacOS using `glfwSetWindowSize()` - window visually move down. Bottom of the window remains stationary. This is because MacOS positions windows from the bottom-left corner while glfw positions windows from the top-left corner. A workaround to this issue is to move window upwards by the difference of current and new window size. glfw does not do that when window is resized.\r\n\r\nHere is workaround code:\r\n```cpp\r\nstatic void ImGui_ImplGlfw_SetWindowSize(ImGuiViewport* viewport, ImVec2 size)\r\n{\r\n    ImGuiViewportDataGlfw* data = (ImGuiViewportDataGlfw*)viewport->PlatformUserData;\r\n#if __APPLE__\r\n    // Windows are positioned by bottom-left corner on MacOS. ImGui windows are positioned by top-left corner. When we\r\n    // change size of a window we must move it as well in order to create illusion of positioning by top-left corner.\r\n    int x, y, width, height;\r\n    glfwGetWindowPos(data->Window, &x, &y);\r\n    glfwGetWindowSize(data->Window, &width, &height);\r\n    glfwSetWindowPos(data->Window, x, y - height + size.y);\r\n#endif\r\n    glfwSetWindowSize(data->Window, (int)size.x, (int)size.y);\r\n}\r\n```","closed_by":{"login":"elmindreda","id":133714,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMzcxNA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/133714?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda","html_url":"https://github.com/elmindreda","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/glfw/glfw/issues/1553/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/glfw/glfw/issues/1553/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
