issue has been moved from SourceForge.\n\n> Tested under Windows 8, but probably exists for prior versions, `_glfw.monitorCallback` is only being called on physical device connects/disconnects. The cause of this is that it relies on the `WM_DEVICECHANGE`/`DBT_DEVNODES_CHANGED` message which is, of course, only sent when a physical device is connected or disconnected from the system. This means that enabling or disabling displays (e.g., turning extended display settings on/off) does not trigger a callback and cannot be re-enumerated without restarting the program.\n> \n> By using Spy++ to watch notifications sent when displays were enabled/disabled I was able to identify a few notifications that are triggered through this action, of which `WM_DISPLAYCHANGE` is the most promising (the others tended to get sent multiple times). As a proof of concept, I modified `windowProc` in `win32_window.c`, but I have concerns about it's suitability as a permanent solution. Off the top of my head, though, I see two reasons why this solution might not be a good one:\n> - it means that display connects/disconnects will result in `_glfwInputMonitorChange` being called twice as a result of handling both 'WM_DEVICECHANGE`and`WM_DISPLAYCHANGE`.\n> - it means that initiating a video mode change will result in `_glfwInputMonitorChange` being called unnecessarily.\n> \n> There is probably a better way of handling this scenario, but Windows isn't my thing and I don't really know how else to integrate support for handling display enabling/disabling with the existing methods for handling notifications.\n> \n> Regardless, as enabling/disabling monitors without disconnecting them is a common usage scenario this is something that probably should be supported.\n","closed_by":{"login":"elmindreda","id":133714,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMzcxNA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/133714?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda","html_url":"https://github.com/elmindreda","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/glfw/glfw/issues/53/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/glfw/glfw/issues/53/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
