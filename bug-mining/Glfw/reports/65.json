Mac OS X Yosemite and Mavericks with glfw 3.1.1,  when the desired fullscreen video mode is the current one, the doc says the video mode will not be changed and that a borderless full screen window is created. However, when this is the case, any loss of focus in the app (command line app for me) result in the disappearance of this fullscreen window, no matter what the GLFW_AUTO_ICONIFY hint is.
