initialisation is that some programs may expect to have an alpha channel if they require one and store things into it, even if it isn’t used for composition.\r\n\r\nI’m not sure how to solve this

\r\n\r\nwith https://github.com/glfw/glfw/commit/6281f498c875f49d8ac5c5a02d968fb1792fd9f5 that's included in GLFW 3.3.7+, the `EGL_PRESENT_OPAQUE_EXT` attribute is unconditionally used in the `eglCreateWindowSurface()` call (assuming the client code sets `glfwWindowHint(GLFW_CONTEXT_CREATION_API, GLFW_EGL_CONTEXT_API)` to pick EGL over GLX). When using GLFW built for X11 (in my case the [glfw-x11](https://archlinux.org/packages/extra/x86_64/glfw-x11/) ArchLinux package), with NVidia drivers (in particular 535.54.03, other versions probably have the same problem) I get the following error:\r\n\r\n```\r\nEGL: Failed to create window surface: An unrecognized attribute or attribute value was passed in the attribute list\r\n```\r\n\r\nI checked with `apitrace trace --api=egl`, the `EGL_PRESENT_OPAQUE_EXT` was the only attribute passed in the attribute list, and using GLFW 3.3.6 (which doesn't set this attribute yet) worked. As far as I could tell, `EGL_EXT_present_opaque` is reported as supported by NVidia, it's just that the driver doesn't seem to recognize it correctly on X11. With Mesa (where `eglinfo` reports the extension as supported as well), everything works. In other words, this doesn't seem to be a bug in GLFW, but -- as far as I can tell -- in NVidia drivers.\r\n\r\nOn Wayland, from what I could gather in https://github.com/glfw/glfw/issues/1434 and https://github.com/glfw/glfw/issues/1803, this is essential to do there to prevent the window from being transparent by accident, and there I assume the NVidia driver works correctly (relevant changes being in https://github.com/NVIDIA/egl-wayland/commit/e1165add0492e7b4b2c7c0ce76011e6f31067642 I think). However, there's also this: https://github.com/kovidgoyal/kitty/issues/5479\r\n\r\nApart from waiting for NVidia to fix this (if it gets fixed at all), I'm not sure what would be the best workaround. Some ideas:\r\n\r\n- Don't set `EGL_EXT_present_opaque` attributes at all on an X11 build. As far as I could tell, using GLFW 3.3.6 (which doesn't set this attribute) wasn't causing any rendering artifacts or accidental transparency on X11. To me this seems like the easiest path to success.\r\n- Treat `EGL_EXT_present_opaque` as not supported on NVidia + X11, even if it reports it as being supported. Depending on whether you have any scaffolding for driver-specific workarounds in GLFW.\r\n- I saw there's `GLFW_TRANSPARENT_FRAMEBUFFER`, maybe it could be (ab)used in some way to control whether the `EGL_EXT_present_opaque` attribute gets used or not? Seems a bit messy though, and it'd move the responsibility of working around driver bugs to unsuspecting users.\r\n- Or maybe there's some way to \"fake\" the EGL extension list GLFW uses, so I could convince it that `EGL_EXT_present_opaque` isn't supported? Which is again moving the responsibility of working around driver bugs to the user, but at least something.\r\n\r\nThank you!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/glfw/glfw/issues/2365/reactions","total_count":3,"+1":3,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/glfw/glfw/issues/2365/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
