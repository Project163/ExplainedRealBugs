Otherwise, glfw based applications will behave differently than all other applications on systems where the behavior of num lock has been changed. \r\n\r\nThe ideal solution would be a key callback API that reports logical key names as reported by the OS after any keyboard layout/lock key mapping etc takes place. This will not break existing applications, which could continue to use the old API. The new API could either use a new callback function or a switch that changes the behavior of the existing one at runtime.

If you want to take on one of them then please leave a comment below so we can avoid duplicate work. Also, in many cases there is already a work-in-progress branch, some of them already on GitHub. I'll start pushing the remaining ones as soon as I'm able.\r\n\r\nIf you are waiting for one of these features but would prefer that 3.3 not be delayed for it, please leave a comment. Also, if you have no personal interest in a feature but think it's worth delaying the release for it, please leave a comment and (optionally) explain why.\r\n\r\n- ~[ ] Joystick state callbacks (`glfwSetJoystick*Callback`) #601 (half of), #856~\r\n  - some work, all platforms, intersects with event time\r\n- ~[ ] Joystick state query (`glfwGetJoystickState`, `GLFWjoystickstate`) #601 (half of)~\r\n  - little work, shared code only\r\n- ~Event time (`glfwGetEventTime`) #1012~\r\n- ~EGLDevice backend (no API change) #786~\r\n- ~[ ] Disable screensaver via libdbus (no API change) #854~\r\n  - some work, Unix only\r\n- ~Native handle attachment (function name needed) #25~\r\n- ~IME functions (pre-edit event, pre-edit window position, IME toggle) #41, #658~\r\n- [x] macOS window occlusion (design needed) #680 \r\n  - unknown amount of work\r\n\r\nThere are also many very valuable ways to contribute other than making feature PRs.\r\n\r\nI know some of you are very familiar with the internals and conventions of GLFW. You could team up with and mentor someone new to the project who is taking on one of the above features and get the PR from promising to ready to merge.\r\n\r\nDocumentation bug reports and PRs are always welcome. There has been a lot of documentation added or changed since the last release. There will be mistakes in it, as well as awkward phrasings and poor explanations. The compilation and build guides are especially terrible and could use both improvements, expansion and (especially for the GUI parts) lots of images (default system DPI, default UI theme).\r\n\r\n~The Doxygen custom CSS needs to be updated since Doxygen broke tons of the current one in a recent release. Most importantly the colors of the new dynamic menus. This one doesn't have an issue so open one if you're taking this on.~ Done by @siavashserver in #1100 \r\n\r\nIs your project using GLFW? Are you still using 3.2.1 or earlier? Try running it on 3.3 and see if everything works. If not, please open an issue ASAP.\r\n\r\nDo you have any joysticks or controllers laying around? There have been major changes to the macOS joystick backend, the Linux one has been replaced entirely and the SDL_gamecontrollerdb support needs all the testing it can get.\r\n\r\nSince we just added a new parser with `glfwUpdateGamepadMappings`, run fuzzers against it and report or fix any bugs they find.\r\n\r\nMeta-contributions: suggest new suggestions for this
