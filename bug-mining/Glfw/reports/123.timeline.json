what I was able to figure out through my own testing, there are some issues with winmm for joystick handling on Windows 8.1.  Its difficult to find any reliable data on winmm and the consensus is that it was replaced with directinput.\n\nThis was tested on WIndows 8.1 Pro x64\nThe symptoms has to do with connecting Xbox 360 wireless controllers while a process is running.  I only have 3 controllers so I'm not sure on the behavior of a 4th controller.\n\nRepro steps:\n1. Start windows process\n2. Connect controller 0, verify receiving input correctly\n3. Step 2 with controller 1\n4. Connect controller 2.\n\nAt this point, something odd happens.  glfw creates separate pointers for the buttons, presence, and axes all correctly and all the data being passed into winmm are correct.  But the data retrieved by the windows functions for controller 2 is ACTUALLY the data from controller 1!\n\nThere's some sort of weird overlap that happens with the windows joystick pointers where, when requesting data from the 3rd connected controller, it returns data from the 2nd.\n\nThis behavior does not occur if all 3 controllers are connected before the process is started!  I've been tackling this for the better part of a week and my conclusion is that WIndows 8 broke winmm in this specific case.\n\nThis issue isnt with glfw per se, I am mostly interested in hearing any feedback from anyone with more knowledge of winmm or, especially, someone able to reproduce this issue on their own.\n\nIs it possible to upgrade to dinput?  Is that planned?  I'm interested in hearing the possibilities! \n\nThank you for taking a look!\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/glfw/glfw/issues/337/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/glfw/glfw/issues/337/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":220723768,"node_id":"MDEzOkFzc2lnbmVkRXZlbnQyMjA3MjM3Njg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/glfw/glfw/issues/events/220723768","actor":{"login":"elmindreda","id":133714,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMzcxNA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/133714?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda","html_url":"https://github.com/elmindreda","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"assigned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2015-01-19T00:58:53Z","assignee":{"login":"elmindreda","id":133714,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMzcxNA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/133714?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda","html_url":"https://github.com/elmindreda","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"actor":{"login":"elmindreda","id":133714,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMzcxNA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/133714?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda","html_url":"https://github.com/elmindreda","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-02-22T19:37:23Z","updated_at":"2015-02-22T19:37:23Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/glfw/glfw/issues/446","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/glfw/glfw","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/glfw/glfw/issues/446/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/glfw/glfw/issues/446/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/glfw/glfw/issues/446/events","html_url":"https://github.com/glfw/glfw/issues/446","id":58145794,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU1ODE0NTc5NA==","number":446,"title":"Expose

controller detection bug happens when the game has more than one controller and player 1 unplugs their controller while the game is running. When they restart the game (with only player 2 still plugged in) GLFW registers player 2's controller as Joystick_1. Then when player 1 re-plugs their controller in they make player 2's controller end up registering to Joystick_2 as well. Thus making player 2's controller registered to both Joystick_1 and Joystick_2 leaving player 1's controller not registered to any Joysticks. Is there a way that GLFW can grab the controller's player index from the xbox drivers?

the plethora of controllers I own (from cheapo knock-offs to the real deal) I have now added the Nvidia shield controller to my collection.

GLFW isn't giving any errors, it isn't assigning it to a different number in the list of available controllers (I made a for loop to search through all of the 16 predefined controllers).\n\nSo I thought at least I'd let people over here know about this issue, and later (after I get some sleep) I will be checking with the 8 or so other pc game controllers I have to see if they give the same outcome.\nI will post back here if I find out anymore.

I've been using GLFW for quite some time, in side projects and through [Monkey](https://github.com/blitz-research/monkey). If this is still an issue, I'd be happy to add XInput support. I've already written several dynamic-linking setups, similar to [what Dolphin does](https://github.com/dolphin-emu/dolphin/blob/49ea15b9502d98f08c47429ce93827073cefdaad/Source/Core/InputCommon/ControllerInterface/XInput/XInput.cpp#L77). Only, you know, it doesn't tend to break _as much_. I'm not very familiar with DirectInput, however. That being said, with both WinMM and XInput, what would be a benefit of supporting DirectInput? Also, what would be the best way to structure a change like this? Conditional support when compiling? Support WinMM as a fall-back?\n\nEither way, I'm quite familiar with C and very familiar with C++. [This project](https://github.com/Regal-Internet-Brothers/IOSync/blob/1b70968e1fd85f031a9a159d2195899aeee73521/IOSync/src/devices/native/winnt/Real_XInput_Wrapper.cpp#L103), and [this project](https://github.com/Regal-Internet-Brothers/xinput/blob/bdd1590eea3bb8cefdcb58854c152f7915cb51e3/native/xinput.cpp#L303) both use function-pointers, 'LoadLibrary', and 'GetProcAddress'. They also support 'XInputGetStateEx' when available, meaning the guide button (Button 10) works.\n\nIf you're not interested, I understand. I'm also not the first guy to go to, where git is concerned.\n","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/glfw/glfw/issues/comments/140906122/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"ImmutableOctet","id":3187882,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxODc4ODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3187882?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ImmutableOctet","html_url":"https://github.com/ImmutableOctet","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ImmutableOctet/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ImmutableOctet/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ImmutableOctet/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ImmutableOctet/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ImmutableOctet/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ImmutableOctet/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ImmutableOctet/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ImmutableOctet/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ImmutableOctet/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"actor":{"login":"tikhomirov","id":36554,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2NTU0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/36554?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tikhomirov","html_url":"https://github.com/tikhomirov","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tikhomirov/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tikhomirov/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tikhomirov/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tikhomirov/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tikhomirov/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tikhomirov/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tikhomirov/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tikhomirov/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tikhomirov/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-10-17T21:16:57Z","updated_at":"2015-10-17T21:16:57Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/glfw/glfw/issues/615","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/glfw/glfw","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/glfw/glfw/issues/615/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/glfw/glfw/issues/615/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/glfw/glfw/issues/615/events","html_url":"https://github.com/glfw/glfw/pull/615","id":111985541,"node_id":"MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0NDc5OTU1MjA=","number":615,"title":"Add
