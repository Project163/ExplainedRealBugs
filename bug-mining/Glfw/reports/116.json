is a bit of a trivial issue (and is clearly related to running on a virtual machine) but I thought I would bring it up anyways. After calling glfwInit() on a Windows XP virtual machine the glfw error callback says \"No monitors found\". This happens before calling any OpenGL or other glfw functions so I believe this is not due to the obvious hardware rendering limitations of using a virtual machine but some problem actually getting the monitor.\n\n**Steps to reproduce:**\n\nRun the following code on a Windows XP virtual machine (vmware):\n\n```\n#include \"GLFW/glfw3.h\"\n\nvoid error_func(int ec, const char* errStr);\n\nint main(int argc, char *argv[])\n{\n    GLFWwindow* cWindow;\n\n    glfwSetErrorCallback(error_func);\n\n    if (!glfwInit())\n    {\n        printf(\"Failed to initialize GLFW\");\n    }\n}\n\nvoid error_func(int ec, const char* errStr)\n{\n    printf(\"\\n %s \\n\",errStr);\n}\n```\n","closed_by":{"login":"elmindreda","id":133714,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMzcxNA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/133714?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda","html_url":"https://github.com/elmindreda","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/glfw/glfw/issues/441/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/glfw/glfw/issues/441/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
