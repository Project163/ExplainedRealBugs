Assumptions\n- Using OS X 10.9.5\n- Using a fresh clone of master branch from git repository\n- see: [_Environmental Details_](#user-content-env) section for more detail.\n#### Steps to reproduce:\n- Step One: run cmake\n  \n  ``` shell\n  $ cmake .\n  ```\n  - _Step One's observed output(some omitted for brevity):_\n  \n  ``` shell\n  ...\n  -- Building GLFW only for the native architecture\n  CMake Warning (dev) at examples/CMakeLists.txt:31 (add_executable):\n    Policy CMP0037 is not set: Target names should not be reserved and should\n    match a validity pattern.  Run \"cmake --help-policy CMP0037\" for policy\n    details.  Use the cmake_policy command to set the policy and suppress this\n    warning.\n  \n    The target name \"Split View\" is reserved or not valid for certain CMake\n    features, such as generator expressions, and may result in undefined\n    behavior.\n  This warning is for project developers.  Use -Wno-dev to suppress it.\n  ...\n  ```\n- Step Two: run make\n  `shell\n  $ make\n  `\n  - _Step Two's observed output(some omitted for brevity):_\n  \n  ``` shell\n  ...\n  [ 35%] Built target Simple\n  examples/CMakeFiles/Split View.dir/build.make:76: *** missing separator.  Stop.\n  make[1]: *** [examples/CMakeFiles/Split View.dir/all] Error 2\n  make: *** [all] Error 2\n  ```\n#### <a name=\"env\"></a>Environmental Details:\n\n``` shell\n$ cmake -version\ncmake version 3.0.2\n\nCMake suite maintained and supported by Kitware (kitware.com/cmake).\n$ make -version\nGNU Make 3.82\nBuilt for x86_64-apple-darwin13.0.0\nCopyright (C) 2010  Free Software Foundation, Inc.\nLicense GPLv3+: GNU GPL version 3 or later <http://gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html>\nThis is free software: you are free to change and redistribute it.\nThere is NO WARRANTY, to the extent permitted by law.\n$ git --version\ngit version 2.0.1\n```\n#### My Workaround:\n\nAfter reading:\n\n``` shell\n$ cmake --help-policy CMP0037\nCMP0037\n-------\n\nTarget names should not be reserved and should match a validity pattern.\n\nCMake 2.8.12 and lower allowed creating targets using ``add_library()``,\n``add_executable()`` and ``add_custom_target()`` with unrestricted\nchoice for the target name.  Newer cmake features such\nas ``cmake-generator-expressions(7)`` and some\ndiagnostics expect target names to match a restricted pattern.\n\nTarget names may contain upper and lower case letters, numbers, the underscore\ncharacter (_), dot(.), plus(+) and minus(-).  As a special case, ALIAS\ntargets and IMPORTED targets may contain two consequtive colons.\n\nTarget names reserved by one or more CMake generators are not allowed.\nAmong others these include \"all\", \"help\" and \"test\".\n\nThe OLD behavior for this policy is to allow creating targets with\nreserved names or which do not match the validity pattern.\nThe NEW behavior for this policy is to report an error\nif an add_* command is used with an invalid target name.\n\nThis policy was introduced in CMake version 3.0.  CMake version\n3.0.2 warns when the policy is not set and uses OLD behavior.  Use\nthe cmake_policy command to set it to OLD or NEW explicitly.\n```\n\nI implemented a fix in [one of my fork's branches](https://github.com/virtuoushub/glfw/commit/eaab71a8b2ce260a138c5e4f2a2f33246792de2f) that allowed `$ make` to complete successfully.\n","closed_by":{"login":"elmindreda","id":133714,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMzcxNA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/133714?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda","html_url":"https://github.com/elmindreda","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/glfw/glfw/issues/388/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/glfw/glfw/issues/388/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
