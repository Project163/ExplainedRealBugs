to the docs at http://www.glfw.org/docs/latest/group__context.html#ga1c04dc242268f827290fe40aa1c91157 you can call glfwMakeContextCurrent with \"NULL to detach the current context\". \nYet this will always segfaults as glfwMakeContextCurrent() doesn't check for handle/window being NULL:\n\n```\n    _GLFWwindow* window = (_GLFWwindow*) handle;\n\n    _GLFW_REQUIRE_INIT();\n\n    if (window->context.api == GLFW_NO_API)\n    {\n        _glfwInputError(GLFW_NO_WINDOW_CONTEXT, NULL);\n        return;\n    }\n\n    _glfwPlatformMakeContextCurrent(window);\n```\n\nChanging that to:\n\n```\n    _GLFWwindow* window = (_GLFWwindow*) handle;\n\n    _GLFW_REQUIRE_INIT();\n\n    if (window && window->context.api == GLFW_NO_API)\n    {\n        _glfwInputError(GLFW_NO_WINDOW_CONTEXT, NULL);\n        return;\n    }\n\n    _glfwPlatformMakeContextCurrent(window);\n```\n\nfixes things for me.\n","closed_by":{"login":"elmindreda","id":133714,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMzcxNA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/133714?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda","html_url":"https://github.com/elmindreda","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/glfw/glfw/issues/631/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/glfw/glfw/issues/631/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
