propose two new window hints. I think it's very useful to have them available when developing and debugging OpenGL apps, because they can allow for shorter turnaround times when making/testing changes (e.g., see [here](https://twitter.com/shurcooL/status/338102646399451136)).\n\nGLFW_ALWAYS_ON_TOP (or similar) - default false - when set to true, the window that is created is set to float on top of (most) other windows.\n\nGLFW_NO_FOCUS_AT_CREATION (or similar) - default false - when set to true, the window that is created does not automatically set itself to be the focused/selected window (the user can of course click it to select it, it just doesn't get selected at window creation time).\n\nI'm pretty sure it should be possible to achieve both these effects in all OSes.\n\nI know for OS X, the first hint can be achieved by adding this to `createWindow()` at [src/cocoa_window.m#L859](https://github.com/glfw/glfw/blob/master/src/cocoa_window.m#L859):\n\n```\n[window->ns.object setLevel:NSFloatingWindowLevel];\n```\n\nAnd the second hint can be achieved by **not** calling this at [src/cocoa_window.m#L803](https://github.com/glfw/glfw/blob/master/src/cocoa_window.m#L803):\n\n```\nSetFrontProcess(&psn);\n```\n\nThank
