description\r\n\r\nOnly 1 of my 2 connected PS3 gamepads work. The second on is not detected, but it's motion sensor is. I'm running on Arch Linux and I've got 2 PS3 controllers connected through bluetooth. \r\n\r\nGLFW detects these controlles properly:\r\n\r\n```c\r\n ➤ gcc -lglfw glfw_gamepad_enumerate.c -o glfw_gamepad_enumerate && ./glfw_gamepad_enumerate\r\nGP  1: 1 'Lenovo TrackPoint Keyboard II'\r\nGP  2: 1 'Sony PLAYSTATION(R)3 Controller'\r\nGP  3: 1 'Sony PLAYSTATION(R)3 Controller'\r\nGP  4: 1 'Telink Wireless Receiver Consumer Control'\r\nGP  5: 0 '(null)'\r\nGP  6: 0 '(null)'\r\nGP  7: 0 '(null)'\r\nGP  8: 0 '(null)'\r\n ➤ cat glfw_gamepad_enumerate.c\r\n\r\n#include <stdio.h>\r\n#include <GLFW/glfw3.h>\r\n\r\nint main(void) {\r\n\r\n  if (!glfwInit()) return 111;\r\n\r\n  printf(\"GP  1: %d '%s'\\n\", glfwJoystickPresent(GLFW_JOYSTICK_1), glfwGetJoystickName(GLFW_JOYSTICK_1));\r\n  printf(\"GP  2: %d '%s'\\n\", glfwJoystickPresent(GLFW_JOYSTICK_2), glfwGetJoystickName(GLFW_JOYSTICK_2));\r\n  printf(\"GP  3: %d '%s'\\n\", glfwJoystickPresent(GLFW_JOYSTICK_3), glfwGetJoystickName(GLFW_JOYSTICK_3));\r\n  printf(\"GP  4: %d '%s'\\n\", glfwJoystickPresent(GLFW_JOYSTICK_4), glfwGetJoystickName(GLFW_JOYSTICK_4));\r\n  printf(\"GP  5: %d '%s'\\n\", glfwJoystickPresent(GLFW_JOYSTICK_5), glfwGetJoystickName(GLFW_JOYSTICK_5));\r\n  printf(\"GP  6: %d '%s'\\n\", glfwJoystickPresent(GLFW_JOYSTICK_6), glfwGetJoystickName(GLFW_JOYSTICK_6));\r\n  printf(\"GP  7: %d '%s'\\n\", glfwJoystickPresent(GLFW_JOYSTICK_7), glfwGetJoystickName(GLFW_JOYSTICK_7));\r\n  printf(\"GP  8: %d '%s'\\n\", glfwJoystickPresent(GLFW_JOYSTICK_8), glfwGetJoystickName(GLFW_JOYSTICK_8));\r\n\r\n  glfwTerminate();\r\n  return 0;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nI'm using glfw 3.3.8-1 and this works correctly. However, running a similar example with raylib yields a missing GamePad:\r\n\r\n```c\r\nklm@kc ~/o/r/e/core ➤ gcc core_input_gamepad_enumerate.c -o core_input_gamepad_enumerate -lraylib && ./core_input_gamepad_enumerate | grep ^GP\r\nGP  0: Lenovo TrackPoint Keyboard II\r\nGP  1: Sony PLAYSTATION(R)3 Controller Motion Sensors\r\nGP  2: Sony PLAYSTATION(R)3 Controller\r\nGP  3: Sony PLAYSTATION(R)3 Controller Motion Sensors\r\nGP  4: not evailable\r\nGP  5: not evailable\r\nGP  6: not evailable\r\nGP  7: not evailable\r\nGP  8: not evailable\r\nGP  9: not evailable\r\nGP 10: not evailable\r\nGP 11: not evailable\r\nGP 12: not evailable\r\nGP 13: not evailable\r\nGP 14: not evailable\r\nGP 15: not evailable\r\nklm@kc ~/o/r/e/core ➤ cat core_input_gamepad_enumerate.c\r\n#include \"raylib.h\"\r\n#include <stdio.h>\r\n\r\nint main() {\r\n  InitWindow(100, 100, \"raylib [core] example - gamepad input enumeration\");\r\n  SetTargetFPS(60);\r\n\r\n  // workaround: gamepads aren't detected in first frame\r\n  BeginDrawing(); EndDrawing();\r\n\r\n  BeginDrawing();\r\n  for(int gamepad = 0 ; gamepad < 16 ; gamepad++) {\r\n    if (IsGamepadAvailable(gamepad)) {\r\n      printf(\"GP %2d: %s\\n\", gamepad, GetGamepadName(gamepad));\r\n    } else {\r\n      printf(\"GP %2d: not evailable\\n\", gamepad);\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n  EndDrawing();\r\n\r\n  CloseWindow();\r\n  return 0;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nEach gamepad has a \"normal\" variant and a motion sensor variant, reported separately. The motion sensor is used to get accelerometer input. GLFW reports there gamepads differently, but I don't think it matters. As you can see, raylib can find both motion sensors correctly, but only the first regular gamepad is detected.\r\n\r\nThe official core_input_gamepad example (latest build) also has this problem as I browse through the gamepads by pressing right-arrow.\r\n\r\n### Environment\r\n\r\nArch Linux\r\n\r\n```sh\r\n ➤ ldd core_input_gamepad\r\n\tlinux-vdso.so.1 (0x00007ffd593f0000)\r\n\tlibm.so.6 => /usr/lib/libm.so.6 (0x00007f7b72ca0000)\r\n\tlibOpenGL.so.0 => /usr/lib/libOpenGL.so.0 (0x00007f7b72c75000)\r\n\tlibGLX.so.0 => /usr/lib/libGLX.so.0 (0x00007f7b72c43000)\r\n\tlibGLU.so.1 => /usr/lib/libGLU.so.1 (0x00007f7b72bed000)\r\n\tlibc.so.6 => /usr/lib/libc.so.6 (0x00007f7b72a03000)\r\n\t/lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2 => /usr/lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2 (0x00007f7b72f05000)\r\n\tlibGLdispatch.so.0 => /usr/lib/libGLdispatch.so.0 (0x00007f7b7294b000)\r\n\tlibX11.so.6 => /usr/lib/libX11.so.6 (0x00007f7b72806000)\r\n\tlibstdc++.so.6 => /usr/lib/libstdc++.so.6 (0x00007f7b72400000)\r\n\tlibgcc_s.so.1 => /usr/lib/libgcc_s.so.1 (0x00007f7b727e1000)\r\n\tlibxcb.so.1 => /usr/lib/libxcb.so.1 (0x00007f7b727b6000)\r\n\tlibXau.so.6 => /usr/lib/libXau.so.6 (0x00007f7b727b1000)\r\n\tlibXdmcp.so.6 => /usr/lib/libXdmcp.so.6 (0x00007f7b727a7000)\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Issue Screenshot\r\n\r\n### Code Example\r\n\r\nSee snippets above.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/raysan5/raylib/issues/3194/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/raysan5/raylib/issues/3194/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":11486713266,"node_id":"REFE_lADOAJFXBc5DEQYUzwAAAAKsqVWy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/glfw/glfw/issues/events/11486713266","actor":{"login":"RoBaertschi","id":72601088,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcyNjAxMDg4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/72601088?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/RoBaertschi","html_url":"https://github.com/RoBaertschi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RoBaertschi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RoBaertschi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RoBaertschi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RoBaertschi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RoBaertschi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RoBaertschi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RoBaertschi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RoBaertschi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RoBaertschi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"388f2cdc3a3a2ffb11c4c3e02115c67ab4c73063","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/RoBaertschi/glfw/commits/388f2cdc3a3a2ffb11c4c3e02115c67ab4c73063","created_at":"2024-01-15T10:54:11Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
