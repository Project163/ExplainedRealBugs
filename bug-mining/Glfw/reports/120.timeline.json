this is a question.\n\nIn the current GLFW API, is it possible to take an existing window that was opened in normal \"windowed\" mode and make it go \"fullscreen\" (either \"windowed fullscreen\" or otherwise) but _without_ closing the existing window and opening a new window?\n\nFrom my reading of http://www.glfw.org/docs/latest/window.html#window_creation, it sounds like the API does not provide such ability, is that correct? (Please let me know if the question is unclear.)\n\nI just want to confirm that's the case. Perhaps I am missing something, maybe it's possible to do the above via `glfwSetWindowSize` or so.\n\nThe reason I ask is because there are some operating systems/platforms where it's possible to do such an operation without having to destroy the window and the associated GL context, and I'd like to see if I can implement such a backend while staying true to the GLFW API.\n\nThank you!\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/glfw/glfw/issues/523/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/glfw/glfw/issues/523/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"actor":{"login":"elmindreda","id":133714,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMzcxNA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/133714?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda","html_url":"https://github.com/elmindreda","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-06-22T09:36:37Z","updated_at":"2015-06-22T09:36:37Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/glfw/glfw/issues/537","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/glfw/glfw","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/glfw/glfw/issues/537/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/glfw/glfw/issues/537/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/glfw/glfw/issues/537/events","html_url":"https://github.com/glfw/glfw/issues/537","id":89858527,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU4OTg1ODUyNw==","number":537,"title":"Allow

If there is a way to stop the context being deleted and sharing it between windows then please let me know\n\nThis framework is fantastic even without this, it's what GLUT should have been, thanks.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/glfw/glfw/issues/537/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/glfw/glfw/issues/537/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/glfw/glfw/issues/comments/135598707","html_url":"https://github.com/glfw/glfw/issues/43#issuecomment-135598707","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/glfw/glfw/issues/43","id":135598707,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEzNTU5ODcwNw==","user":{"login":"theagentd","id":1215113,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMTUxMTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1215113?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/theagentd","html_url":"https://github.com/theagentd","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/theagentd/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/theagentd/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/theagentd/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/theagentd/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/theagentd/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/theagentd/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/theagentd/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/theagentd/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/theagentd/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-08-28T01:27:41Z","updated_at":"2015-08-28T01:27:41Z","body":"Is there an ETA on this?

of 3.2 there is code available in GLFW to go fullscreen without destroying a window. \nhttps://github.com/glfw/glfw/issues/43\nhttps://github.com/glfw/glfw/commit/94ccaead5b8436756729759132b22893005071ff\n\nIt still requires a bit of work on our end (the way they do it is a bit weird, but it works) and we will still need to track non-fullscreen positions, but it could be a good basis for fixing some of the fullscreen issues we are seeing on Windows (#5155 not sure if this one is completely related) and Linux (#5129)\n\nI have run into a fair number of small issues with fullscreen on Windows with 0.9 - 0.9.3, mainly with trying to go fullscreen on a second monitor from code ( ie not dragged to the monitor ).  And the way we go fullscreen making it hard to debug when the app crashes ( it doesn't allow you to tab away from the window ). \n\nIt feels like a good time to update ofAppGLFWWindow to use new 3.2 features and try and and make it more stable overall. \n\nI did a quick test with the new API on windows - using it directly in ofApp. \n'f' puts a window fullscreen on the monitor it is on or if its top left corner is outside of any monitor, the closest one.  \n'w' makes it a window again - but it doesn't currently restore the position \n\nI am going to try this on OS X. \nWould be great if someone could try it on Linux. \n\nIf it seems to work well it could allow us to remove some of the platform specific windowing code from ofAppGLFWWindow.  We will still need to do something custom probably for multi-window fullscreen, but I think letting GLFW do as much as possible would be ideal. \n\n```\n//--------------------------------------------------------------\nvoid ofApp::keyPressed(int key) {\n\n    if (key == 'f') {\n\n            shared_ptr<ofAppGLFWWindow> ptr = dynamic_pointer_cast<ofAppGLFWWindow>(ofGetCurrentWindow());\n            if (ptr) {\n                int count = 0;\n                GLFWmonitor** monitors = glfwGetMonitors(&count);\n\n                //check each existing monitor and see if the window top left is inside any of them \n                // if not match by closest position \n\n                int winPosX, winPosY = 0;\n                glfwGetWindowPos(ptr->getGLFWWindow(), &winPosX, &winPosY);\n                ofPoint winPos(winPosX, winPosY); \n\n                int closestIndex = -1;\n                float closestDist = 9999999.0;\n\n                for (int d = 0; d < count; d++) {\n                    if (monitors[d] != NULL) {\n                        int x, y = 0;\n                        glfwGetMonitorPos(monitors[d], &x, &y);\n                        const GLFWvidmode* mode = glfwGetVideoMode(monitors[d]);\n                        ofRectangle rect(x, y, mode->width, mode->height);\n\n                        //if we are inside a monitor - make this the one to go fullscreen on \n                        if (rect.inside(x, y)) {\n                            closestIndex = d;\n                            break; \n                        }\n\n                        //otherwise if we are not inside a monitor look for closest monitor\n                        float dist = (winPos - rect.getTopLeft()).length();\n                        if (dist < closestDist) {\n                            closestDist = dist; \n                            closestIndex = d; \n                        }\n                    }\n                }\n\n                if (closestIndex >= 0) {\n                    const GLFWvidmode* mode = glfwGetVideoMode(monitors[closestIndex]);\n                    glfwSetWindowMonitor(ptr->getGLFWWindow(), monitors[closestIndex], winPosX, winPosY, mode->width, mode->height, mode->refreshRate);\n                }\n            }\n\n    }\n\n    if (key == 'w') {\n        shared_ptr<ofAppGLFWWindow> ptr = dynamic_pointer_cast<ofAppGLFWWindow>(ofGetCurrentWindow());\n        glfwSetWindowMonitor(ptr->getGLFWWindow(), NULL, 40, 40, 1280, 720, 0);\n        ofSetVerticalSync(true);\n    }\n}\n```\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openframeworks/openFrameworks/issues/5158/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openframeworks/openFrameworks/issues/5158/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/glfw/glfw/issues/comments/249284287","html_url":"https://github.com/glfw/glfw/issues/43#issuecomment-249284287","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/glfw/glfw/issues/43","id":249284287,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI0OTI4NDI4Nw==","user":{"login":"jgandert","id":3063858,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwNjM4NTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3063858?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgandert","html_url":"https://github.com/jgandert","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgandert/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgandert/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgandert/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgandert/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgandert/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgandert/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgandert/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgandert/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgandert/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-09-23T19:40:33Z","updated_at":"2016-09-23T19:40:33Z","body":"@elmindreda Does this restore the window on the monitor it was previously on?
