\r\n\r\nI'm using GLFW in a Cocoa app, I can create and interact with a GLFW window just fine, however, void ```_glfwPlatformDestroyWindow``` crashes in the call to ```[_glfw.ns.autoreleasePool drain];```\r\n\r\nThis happens whenever I try to call ```glfwDestroyWindow(window);```, either from inside the window close callback, or from another message. \r\n\r\nIn fact, ANY glfw call that invokes ``` [_glfw.ns.autoreleasePool drain];```, such as ```void _glfwPlatformPollEvents(void)``` results in a segfault. \r\n\r\nI've got a git repo that demonstrates this issue:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/AndySomogyi/CocoaGLFW\r\n\r\nI basically took the GLFW example, and hooked up to a Cocoa app, the exact file that interacts with GLFW is \r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/AndySomogyi/CocoaGLFW/blob/master/GLFWTest.cpp\r\n\r\nIt's actually *REALLY* important that I can use GLFW with the native UI, as our app will use WPF on Windows, and Cocoa on Mac.
