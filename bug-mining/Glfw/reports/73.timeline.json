case this can't be solved I am proposing to implement a workaround that sleeps until the next vertical refresh. IMHO this is a better solution that just doing nothing as it is currently. The current implementation is not really portable because on Linux & Mac OS glfwSwapInterval(1) will correctly synchronize with the vertical refresh while on Windows it does nothing, thus causing projects to run at lightning speed. I've already played around with a workaround that waits until the next vertical refresh and it's working quite well but of course there is the disadvantage that it will hog the CPU because you need to poll the performance counter because Win32's Sleep() function is not precise enough for this kind of task. See here for some more elaborations on this topic by me: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/30437756/glfwswapbuffers-and-vertical-refresh-on-windows\n\nOf course I'm still hoping that you can come up with a nice solution which works everywhere and doesn't hog the CPU but in case it's not possible, I'd suggest to use a polling timer to do the vertical refresh synchronization for portability's and consistency's sake.\n","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/glfw/glfw/issues/comments/107246066/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"afalkenhahn","id":6772528,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY3NzI1Mjg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6772528?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/afalkenhahn","html_url":"https://github.com/afalkenhahn","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afalkenhahn/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afalkenhahn/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afalkenhahn/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afalkenhahn/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afalkenhahn/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afalkenhahn/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afalkenhahn/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afalkenhahn/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/afalkenhahn/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":324637156,"node_id":"MDE3OkRlbWlsZXN0b25lZEV2ZW50MzI0NjM3MTU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/glfw/glfw/issues/events/324637156","actor":{"login":"elmindreda","id":133714,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMzcxNA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/133714?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda","html_url":"https://github.com/elmindreda","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"demilestoned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2015-06-07T11:34:56Z","milestone":{"title":"3.2"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":324637157,"node_id":"MDE1Ok1pbGVzdG9uZWRFdmVudDMyNDYzNzE1Nw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/glfw/glfw/issues/events/324637157","actor":{"login":"elmindreda","id":133714,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMzcxNA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/133714?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda","html_url":"https://github.com/elmindreda","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"milestoned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2015-06-07T11:34:56Z","milestone":{"title":"3.1.2"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":324637158,"node_id":"MDE1Ok1pbGVzdG9uZWRFdmVudDMyNDYzNzE1OA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/glfw/glfw/issues/events/324637158","actor":{"login":"elmindreda","id":133714,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMzcxNA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/133714?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda","html_url":"https://github.com/elmindreda","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"milestoned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2015-06-07T11:34:56Z","milestone":{"title":"3.1.2"},"perf

been following the GIT builds for PCSX2 for roughly a year now (since accurate blending was introduced in GSOGL), and every GIT build after the 1.4.0 stable release that I have used has had problems with stuttering. The emulator reports 100% speed and 60 FPS and the game timers and physics run at full speed, but the video is very choppy. Normally, this would only happen when I'm recording with Nvidia Shadowplay or playing in windowed mode, but now it happens in fullscreen mode and windowed mode. Switching to software rendering does not fix the issue. Because of this, I'm stuck on 1.4.0 stable (which works pretty well but lacks fast accurate blending and some other fixes that are very useful, especially in the Gran Turismo series). Also, in the most recent builds with the large framebuffer option included, Gran Turismo 3 and 4 both cause massive slowdowns during races and replays at anything higher than 2x native resolution. This never happened in stable release 1.4.0 nor any of the GIT builds leading to it. My settings are as follows:\n\nEE Round: Chop/Zero\nEE Clamping: Full\nVU Round: Chop/Zero\nVU Clamp: Extra+Preserve Sign\nVsync is disabled in Core GS options, enabling does not fix visual stutter.\nAll speedhacks enabled except for Fast CD/DVD access, EE cyclerate and VU cycle stealing\nNo manual gamefixes enabled\n--GS Plugin settings:\nAdapter: Nvidia GeForce GTX 1080\nRenderer: OpenGL (Hardware)\nInterlacing (F5): Auto\nAllow 8-bit textures: ON\nLarge Framebuffer: ON\nInternal Resolution: 3x Native\nTexture Filtering: Bilinear (PS2)\nCRC Hack Level: Partial (OpenGL Recommended)\nHW Hacks: None (tried safe accurate blending, only caused slowdowns)\nAccurate Date: ON\nBlending Unit Accuracy: High (Recommended high-end PC)\n\nPC Specs:\nMoBo: Gigabyte GA-Z97X-Gaming 7\nCPU: Intel Core i7 4790K\nRAM: 32GB 1600 MHz\nGPU: Nvidia GeForce GTX 1080 FE\nDrive where PCSX2 and OS load from: Samsung 950 PRO 256GB NVMe M.2 SSD\nDrive where .ISO files load from: WD Caviar Blue 1TB 7200 RPM HDD\n\nAs I said before, this has only started happening in GIT builds for 1.5.0.
