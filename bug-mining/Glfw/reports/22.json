the structure given from `glfwGetVideoMode(monitor)` should be the width and the height value swapped if the monitor is left or right rotated (or at least the rotation status should be exposed).\n\nAlso `glfwCreateWindow()` behaves on rotated monitor differently in windowed (w/h correct) and fullscreen (w/h swapped) mode.\n\nNote: The wm (XEvent ConfigureNotify) provides (however after a while) the right w/h values.\nE.g. ubuntu's unity-compiz sends after the switch on the monitor [1680 0]1050x1680 (rotated) the window to fullscreen:\n\n```\nXEvent:ConfigureNotify [0
