[documentation](https://www.glfw.org/docs/3.4/group__window.html#gacccb29947ea4b16860ebef42c2cb9337) for `glfwGetWindowAttrib` says:\n\n> **Wayland**: The Wayland protocol provides no way to check whether a window is iconfied, so `GLFW_ICONIFIED` always returns GLFW_FALSE\n\nThe [documentation](https://www.glfw.org/docs/3.4/group__window.html#gac793e9efd255567b5fb8b445052cfd3e) for `glfwSetWindowIconifyCallback` does not mention whether the callback is supported on Wayland, which is kind of confusing. The [window guide](https://www.glfw.org/docs/3.4/window_guide.html#window_iconify) does not mention this either.\n\nThis becomes even more confusing when you notice that the documentation for `glfwSetWindowPosCallback` [does](https://www.glfw.org/docs/3.4/group__window.html#ga08bdfbba88934f9c4f92fd757979ac74) explicitly mention the callback will never be called on Wayland.\n\nFrom my testing the iconify callback is never called on Wayland. Having this mentioned in the documentation should clear up confusions, especially when people want to use these callbacks to speed up access to the window states on non-main threads.","closed_by":{"login":"elmindreda","id":133714,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMzcxNA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/133714?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda","html_url":"https://github.com/elmindreda","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/glfw/glfw/issues/2746/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/glfw/glfw/issues/2746/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
