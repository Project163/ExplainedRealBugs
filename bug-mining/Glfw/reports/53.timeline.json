spent some time debugging to try to find the source of #531, and found that the root cause seems to be related to [glfw.PollEvents()](https://github.com/fyne-io/fyne/blob/1df1ac1c3bae631e0300e53c653a82ad745c89a5/internal/driver/glfw/loop.go#L84) blocking while the window is being actively resized (see glfw/glfw#408 and glfw/glfw#424). While this call blocks, [freeDirtyTextures()](https://github.com/fyne-io/fyne/blob/1df1ac1c3bae631e0300e53c653a82ad745c89a5/internal/driver/glfw/loop.go#L131) is never called, which has the effect of textures not being updated. Unsure if this is intentional behavior or not, but I don't see scaling content during resize to be desirable in most cases. The recommended fix referenced by the glfw issues seems to be to do processing in window refresh callbacks, which are already present in fyne. I therefore added a call to freeDirtyTextures() in [glfw/window.go>window.refresh()](https://github.com/fyne-io/fyne/blob/1df1ac1c3bae631e0300e53c653a82ad745c89a5/internal/driver/glfw/window.go#L473). Since freeDirtyTextures() used a *glDriver receiver that was never referenced in the function body, I simply removed the receiver to make it easily callable from window.refresh(). If this is not desirable, another means could be found to obtain a glDriver instance from window.refresh().\r\n\r\nFurther, I wanted to add a flag to objects so they could be selectively refreshed during resize, instead of all or none. I accomplished this by adding a method signature to CanvasObject called SkipRefreshDuringResize(), which returns a bool, and implementing this in all the necessary places. Most implementations (including BaseWidget) use a public bool field called RefreshDuringResize, which is returned (inverted) from SkipRefreshDuringResize(). This has the effect of all objects defaulting to not being refreshed during resize. There could be some \"gotcha\" places where widgets maintain lists of child CanvasObjects, and the flag doesn't get propagated from the parent. I ran into this (and fixed it using an alternate constructor) for Icon, but possibly there are other places that might need attention.\r\n\r\nThe selective freeing of dirty textures is accomplished by modifying freeDirtyTextures() to:\r\n- Take a new bool parameter called \"resizing\". When called from [repaintWindow()](https://github.com/fyne-io/fyne/blob/1df1ac1c3bae631e0300e53c653a82ad745c89a5/internal/driver/glfw/loop.go#L116), false is passed for resizing. When called from window.refresh(), true is passed.\r\n- Do not execute canvas.painter.Free(obj) if resizing true and obj.SkipRefreshDuringResize() is true.\r\n- If any of the above calls to Free() are skipped, add the root object (the one retrieved from canvas.refreshQueue) to a map to mark it as needing to be re-added to the queue.\r\n- At the end of the function, use the map to re-add all objects still needing refresh to refreshQueue by calling canvas.Refresh().\r\n\r\nI'm not in love with the above approach, as it means a lot of reading objects off the refreshQueue channel just to put them back. Would be better if there was some means of peeking objects instead of just removing them, but as best I can tell, this isn't possible with channels. Could think about using a different data structure (a slice?), but unsure if a channel is being used because of concurrency considerations (is it?).\r\n\r\nI updated the fyne_demo app to refresh the big icon on the Graphics tab during resize, but not the checkered background, to demonstrate that some objects can be refreshed while others aren't.\r\n\r\nAnyway, I've tested this on Windows 10 1903 (18362.476), and macOS Catalina 10.15.1. I don't have a Linux system to test on at present, or any mobile platforms.\r\n\r\nFixes #531\r\n\r\n**Checklist**\r\n\r\n- [x] Tests included - where it seemed appropriate/reasonable\r\n- [x] Lint and formatter run with no errors\r\n Note: I think so, but not 100% sure exactly what to run to check this. I'm using VSCode with the Go extension, which I believe does auto linting and formatting, and I don't see it complaining about anything. I tried running \"gofmt -w .\" as suggested [here](https://github.com/fyne-io/fyne/wiki/Contributing), on the root of my local fyne repo, and it made 771 changes according to git (looks like changes to every file), so I'm not sure what I'm doing wrong there.\r\n- [x] Tests all pass\r\n\r\n(where applicable)\r\n\r\n- [x] Public APIs match existing style - I think so, but open to discussion.\r\n- [ ] Any breaking changes have a deprecation path or have been discussed - NA\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/fyne-io/fyne/issues/560/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/fyne-io/fyne/issues/560/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
