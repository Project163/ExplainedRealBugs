decided to include GLFW sources in my project [raylib](https://github.com/raysan5/raylib) to avoid dependencies issues that I found in some platforms

module... but I got an error due to the multiple `internal.h` inclusions.\r\n\r\nTo solve that, just added a `#pragma once` at the beginning [of the file](https://github.com/raysan5/raylib/blob/develop/src/external/glfw/src/internal.h#L28).
