3.0 and 3.5:\r\n\r\n```\r\n-- CUDA_ARCHITECTURES=3.0;3.5;5.0;5.2;3.2;3.7;5.3;6.0;6.1;6.2;7.0+PTX\r\n-- CUDA_NVCC_FLAGS=-gencode;arch=compute_30,code=sm_30;-gencode;arch=compute_35,...\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe problem was that since CUDA 11, `compute_30` is deprecated, as documented\r\n[here](https://arnon.dk/matching-sm-architectures-arch-and-gencode-for-various-nvidia-cards/)\r\n\r\n> |Fermi† | Kepler† | Maxwell‡ | Pascal | Volta | Turing | Ampere | Lovelace\\* |

\"Support for Kepler sm_30 and sm_32 architecture based products is dropped.\", i.e. 3.2 should go alongside the 3.0, 3.5, and 3.7 in the table within the blog post (reproduced above)\r\n\r\n- As noted, Fermi and Kepler are deprecated from CUDA 9 and 11 upwards (respectively I presume),\r\n  i.e. in CUDA 11, Kepler is deprecated, and with it (30, 32, 35, 37)\r\n- Additionally, note that from CUDA 12 the Maxwell architectures (50, 52, 53) will be deprecated\r\n\r\nThis explains why `compute_30` was throwing an error and suggests how to fix it. Simply test if\r\nthe CUDA version is greater than or equal to 11, and then skip the architectures from 37 and below.\r\n\r\nTo resolve this I changed the `Gpufit/Gpufit/CMakeLists.txt` to create an empty list instead, and while I was\r\nfixing it for my current architecture I thought I should also future proof it for CUDA 12 and post it here\r\n\r\n```cmake\r\nelseif( CUDA_ARCHITECTURES STREQUAL All )\r\n# All does not include the latest PTX!\r\n  set( CUDA_ARCHITECTURES \"\" )\r\n  if( CUDA_VERSION VERSION_LESS \"11.0\" )\r\n    list( INSERT CUDA_ARCHITECTURES \"3.0\" \"3.5\" )\r\n

\"+PTX\" )\r\nendif()\r\n```\r\n\r\n- I cross referenced against the CUDA docs [for Ampere](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/ampere-compatibility-guide/index.html), [Volta](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/volta-compatibility-guide/index.html), and [Turing](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/turing-compatibility-guide/index.html)\r\n\r\n- I considered using `VERSION_GREATER_EQUAL` but apparently [this breaks backward compatibility with cmake pre-3.7](https://github.com/glfw/glfw/issues/1584)\r\n- When building, I had to skip this control flow block altogether by passing cmake `-DCUDA_ARCHITECTURES=\"8.0 8.6+PTX\"`, perhaps this could be recommended in the docs.\r\n\r\nHappy to submit a pull request with this if you'd like me to.\r\n\r\n-
