own a 3440x1440p monitor and I am looking to run a game (Minecraft) in 2560x1080p in full screen mode to get a performance increase with path-tracing compatible shaders. I currently use the Optifine mod which provides several resolutions to change the game to but none of which are 2560x1080. I scoured through the internet to find a way to accomplish this and I eventually stumbled upon another GitHub issue stating that Minecraft (specifically the Optifine mod) grabs the compatible resolutions from the LWJGL library. Anyway, I'm wondering if there's a way, if any, to add this resolution to the LWJGL library and how exactly to do it. \r\n\r\nI'm sorry if this isn't the correct location to ask this, I just wasn't able to access the LWJGL forums as it requires some coding knowledge to register.
