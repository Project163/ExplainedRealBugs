to reproduce:\r\n\r\n- switch the keyboard to some variant of French AZERTY\r\n- run a program that calls `glfwGetKeyName(GLFW_KEY_2, 0)`\r\n\r\nThis should return \"é\". On a system with locale fr_FR.UTF-8, this should be \"\\xC3\\xA9\" but it returns \"\\xE9\", the same character but in ISO8859-15 encoding (this is a limitation of `XkbTranslateKeySym`).\r\n\r\nI would expect `glfwGetKeyName` to return unicode keynames across all platforms, regardless of the user's locale.\r\n\r\nThis is related to #837.\r\n\r\nAn easy solution is to use the a public domain keysym dataset compiled by Markus G.
