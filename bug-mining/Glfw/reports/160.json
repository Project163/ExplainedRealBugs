don't know if it is worth something but just in case I am creating this issue.\r\n\r\nOS: Linux Mint 18\r\nCommit: c3fd757b\r\n\r\nJust added GLFW as a submodule (on commit c3fd757b, which is master right now) of a project and upon calling 'glfwInit()' my standard library (compiled from sources, thus in \"debug\" mode) gives me the following message:\r\n\r\n`/home/path/to/glfw/glfw/src/x11_monitor.c:117:9: runtime error: null pointer passed as argument 2, which is declared to never be null`\r\n\r\nThe line in question is:\r\n\r\n`memcpy(disconnected, _glfw.monitors, _glfw.monitorCount * sizeof(_GLFWmonitor*));`\r\n\r\nAside from this message, there are no consequences, I am still able to create a window after that.\r\n\r\nIn my case _glfw.monitors is indeed null, however _glfw.monitorCount is 0 and thus the code is requesting to copy 0 bytes of a null pointer. I don't particularly see this as a problem but my memcpy does give me this annoying message.\r\n\r\nI bisected to find the first commit in which the message appears and it's from commit 04f559e2 \"Restructure monitor enumeration\".","closed_by":{"login":"elmindreda","id":133714,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMzcxNA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/133714?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda","html_url":"https://github.com/elmindreda","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/glfw/glfw/issues/950/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/glfw/glfw/issues/950/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
