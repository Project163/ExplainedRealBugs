GLFW uses the EWMH full screen mechanism where available, which leaves almost all such logic up to the window manager. In effect, all GLFW is doing is moving the window to the right monitor and then telling the WM \"full screen, please\".\n\nAs for possible workarounds, you can try forcing non-EWMH full screen by tinkering with `detectEWMH` in `x11_init.c`, which will also disable iconification, or use a windowed mode window and move it to the correct position.\n\nI'm going to look into whether using [`_NET_WM_FULLSCREEN_MONITORS`](http://standards.freedesktop.org/wm-spec/wm-spec-latest.html#idp6368280) can help solve this properly.\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/glfw/glfw/issues/comments/28833812/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"elmindreda","id":133714,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMzcxNA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/133714?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda","html_url":"https://github.com/elmindreda","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"actor":{"login":"capnm","id":4047289,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwNDcyODk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4047289?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/capnm","html_url":"https://github.com/capnm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/capnm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/capnm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/capnm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/capnm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/capnm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/capnm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/capnm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/capnm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/capnm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-04-17T15:56:09Z","updated_at":"2014-04-17T15:56:09Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/glfw/glfw/issues/277","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/glfw/glfw","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/glfw/glfw/issues/277/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/glfw/glfw/issues/277/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/glfw/glfw/issues/277/events","html_url":"https://github.com/glfw/glfw/issues/277","id":31631517,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWUzMTYzMTUxNw==","number":277,"title":"Full
