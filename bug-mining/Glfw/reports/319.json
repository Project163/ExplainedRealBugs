windows on swaywm and rootston are always transparent.\r\nCurrent method to make sure window is opaque, set_opaque_region, according to wayland protocol description, is just an optimization hint. I don't think it would necessarily make window opaque.\r\nAccording to [wayland mailing list](https://lists.freedesktop.org/archives/wayland-devel/2014-March/013651.html), the proper way to make it opaque is to use a buffer without alpha channel.\r\nTo reproduce, comment out the transparent framebuffer hint line in the gears example and run it on swaywm or rootston.\r\nAlthough it can be fixed by manually calling glfwWindowHint(GLFW_ALPHA_BITS, 0), I think this should be default on wayland.","closed_by":{"login":"linkmauve","id":7755816,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc3NTU4MTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7755816?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/linkmauve","html_url":"https://github.com/linkmauve","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linkmauve/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linkmauve/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linkmauve/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linkmauve/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linkmauve/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linkmauve/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linkmauve/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linkmauve/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linkmauve/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/glfw/glfw/issues/1434/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/glfw/glfw/issues/1434/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
