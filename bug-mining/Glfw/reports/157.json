_glfwInitVulkan with _GLFW_FIND_LOADER, and gets as far as vkEnumerateInstanceExtensionProperties before falling foul of the lack of driver support.\r\n\r\nThis might be considered an edge-case not a worth the effort to fix, but it makes it a pain for applications to report a sensible response to the user when they don't have a complete Vulkan
