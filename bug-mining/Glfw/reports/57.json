of all let me thank you for GLFW. I think it is a very well run project (implementation wise, documentation, etc.)\n\nI have a bunch of [small test apps](https://github.com/apitrace/apitrace-tests/tree/master/apps/gl) that use GLFW, but after upgrading from GLFW 3.0 to 3.1 they refuse to run on MacOSX, because `CGDisplayIsAsleep()` returns true for the one and only monitor on the test machine.\n\nI think it would be better to not fail in such case.  Not all OpenGL apps need user intervention, there are many cases where an app might want to run without user (e.g., automatic image processing, etc.)\n","closed_by":{"login":"elmindreda","id":133714,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMzcxNA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/133714?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda","html_url":"https://github.com/elmindreda","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/glfw/glfw/issues/430/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/glfw/glfw/issues/430/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
