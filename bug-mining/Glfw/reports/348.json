seems I can't set the hints `GLFW_X11_CLASS_NAME` and `GLFW_X11_INSTANCE_NAME` individually, meaning, if I do alone either:\r\n\r\n```C\r\nglfwWindowHintString(GLFW_X11_CLASS_NAME, \"my fancy class\");\r\n```\r\n\r\nor \r\n\r\n```C\r\nglfwWindowHintString(GLFW_X11_INSTANCE_NAME, \"my instance\");\r\n```\r\n\r\nthe class and instance parts of the ICCCM `WM_CLASS` are still set by default by the window title.\r\n\r\nIf, however, I set them both in the same program:\r\n\r\n```C\r\n// order is irrelevant\r\nglfwWindowHintString(GLFW_X11_CLASS_NAME, \"my fancy class\");\r\nglfwWindowHintString(GLFW_X11_INSTANCE_NAME, \"my instance\");\r\n```\r\n\r\nthen `xprop` shows that indeed the class and instance parts have been set accordingly.\r\n\r\nI am using x11
