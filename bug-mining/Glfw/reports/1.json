loving this new GLFW because it makes the most obvious things possible, such as the ability to write a program that starts off in a hidden window, say for example, for running graphics scripts in the background without wanting to have window pop up and disrupt my active work on my computer. I don't know if there is a more obvious way to do that, but this way definitely works very well. However, I am still having one minor issue with it. The hidden window is still taking focus. For example, if I'm typing on a terminal while a separate script is running that opens my glfw-based programs in a hidden window, what I'm typing quits going to the terminal I'm on. The focus goes to hidden window. Is there a way to prevent that from happening? If so, could someone let me know how? If not, I'd like to request a way to do so.\nThanks,\nSean\n","closed_by":{"login":"elmindreda","id":133714,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMzcxNA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/133714?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda","html_url":"https://github.com/elmindreda","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/glfw/glfw/issues/93/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/glfw/glfw/issues/93/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
