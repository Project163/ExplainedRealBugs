is two bugs. The incorrect dimensions are fixed with 70c349f36ba6f6371c411cb5372d168a0f24b541. The black screen will be trickier.\n\n[Capturing the display](https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/GraphicsImaging/Conceptual/QuartzDisplayServicesConceptual/Articles/DisplayCapture.html) is what blacks it out. Capturing it with `kCGCaptureNoFill` still blacks it out, at least on my machine. Not capturing it makes everything work... except for messing up the desktop and all other running applications.\n\nCapturing displays doesn't play well with proper [full screen windows](https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/GraphicsImaging/Conceptual/OpenGL-MacProgGuide/opengl_fullscreen/opengl_cgl.html), which I switched to with 6743761c2c3893f95125dfd12b28620b9cf3dfa5.\n\nI could use the old full screen view method if mode setting is required, but that would lose the benefits of the current full screen window path like working Cmd+Tab.\n\nThe correct solution, i.e. not using mode setting and rendering to a texture if lower-resolution rendering is required, won't sit well with some users. I'm postponing that fight until GLFW 4.\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/glfw/glfw/issues/comments/61856226/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"elmindreda","id":133714,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMzcxNA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/133714?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda","html_url":"https://github.com/elmindreda","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/glfw/glfw/issues/comments/62062813","html_url":"https://github.com/glfw/glfw/issues/378#issuecomment-62062813","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/glfw/glfw/issues/378","id":62062813,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYyMDYyODEz","user":{"login":"SephiRok","id":686553,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4NjU1Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/686553?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SephiRok","html_url":"https://github.com/SephiRok","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SephiRok/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SephiRok/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SephiRok/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SephiRok/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SephiRok/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SephiRok/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SephiRok/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SephiRok/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SephiRok/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-11-06T22:25:45Z","updated_at":"2014-11-07T13:05:02Z","body":"Yeah ... note on [capturing the display](https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/GraphicsImaging/Conceptual/QuartzDisplayServicesConceptual/Articles/DisplayCapture.html):\n`Note: None of these drawing options require a window.
