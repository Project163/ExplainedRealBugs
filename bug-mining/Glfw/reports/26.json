calls to XRRGetScreenResources can be very long (due to hardware polling), maybe would be better to use XRRGetScreenResourcesCurrent when this performance penalty can be noticeable, ie:\n\n_glfwPlatformGetVideoModes\n_glfwPlatformGetVideoMode\n_glfwPlatformGetMonitorPos (also?)\n(always in X11 platform)\n\nI measured in my system an improvement of 3 orders of magnitude between XRRGetScreenResources and XRRGetScreenResourcesCurrent, and of 2 orders of magnitude in the execution time of the function glfwGetVideoMode between the two alternatives.\n\nMaybe the rest of \"setters\" functions in x11_monitor.c can be left with XRRGetScreenResources, and also the one in initExtensions (x11_init.c), since I think, although I'm not sure, that these functions are not prone to be called very often, like in every render frame.\n\n(Also, I've to say that I don't have much experience in Github...I think I did well but I was not sure if what I've to do is open an issue like I did or send a patch via pull request, so...I wait for your comments!)\n","closed_by":{"login":"elmindreda","id":133714,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMzcxNA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/133714?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda","html_url":"https://github.com/elmindreda","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/glfw/glfw/issues/347/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/glfw/glfw/issues/347/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
