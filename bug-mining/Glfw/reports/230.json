`IsWindows8Point1OrGreater` and `IsWindows10OrGreater` fail on Windows 10. This is because Windows 10 deprecates `VerifyVersionInfo`.\r\n> While you can still call the deprecated functions, if your application does not specifically target Windows 8.1 or Windows 10, you will get Windows 8 version (6.2.0.0).\r\n\r\nhttps://msdn.microsoft.com/en-gb/library/windows/desktop/dn481241(v=vs.85).aspx\r\n\r\nAmong other things, this leads to per-monitor DPI not behaving correctly on Windows 10.\r\n```\r\nif (IsWindows8Point1OrGreater())\r\n    SetProcessDpiAwareness(PROCESS_PER_MONITOR_DPI_AWARE);\r\nelse if (IsWindowsVistaOrGreater())\r\n    SetProcessDPIAware();\r\n```\r\nThis requires application to provide app manifest.\r\nInternet suggests 2 solutions to this problem, if you want to avoid including app manifest:\r\n1. Use `RtlGetVersion`\r\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/questions/36543301/detecting-windows-10-version\r\n2. Query version of `kernel32.dll` (this will not work well with compatibility options).\r\n\r\nNow, while I could mess around with app manifest myself, GLFW tests and examples will still behave incorrectly.","closed_by":{"login":"elmindreda","id":133714,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMzcxNA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/133714?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda","html_url":"https://github.com/elmindreda","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/glfw/glfw/issues/1294/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/glfw/glfw/issues/1294/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
