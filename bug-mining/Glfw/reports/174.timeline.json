fullscreen mode to windowed mode does not respect the `glfwSetWindowMonitor` arguments.\n\nGLFW 3.2.0 Cocoa NSGL chdir menubar retina dynamic (d97044d9acc0c76433edda5a75b3196957906ca5)\nOS X 10.11.4\nIntel Iris Graphics 6100\n#### Details\n\nWhile in fullscreen mode, calling `glfwSetWindowMonitor(window, NULL, xpos, ypos, width, height, 0);` does not result in a window at `xpos, ypos` with `width x height` dimensions, but rather covers the entire screen (like having double-clicked on the window title bar). Printing all events gives the following sequence:\n\n```\nBEFORE RESTORE to: 520,176 - 640 x 480\n6.252: Window framebuffer resized to 3300 x 2002\n6.253: Window resized to 1650 x 1001\n6.256: Window framebuffer resized to 1650 x 1001\n6.260: Window refreshed\n6.270: Window framebuffer resized to 640 x 480\n6.271: Window resized to 640 x 480\n6.273: Window refreshed\nAFTER RESTORE\n6.277: Window framebuffer resized to 1680 x 1001\n6.278: Window resized to 1680 x 1001\n6.281: Window refreshed\n6.310: Window framebuffer resized to 3360 x 2002\n6.322: Window refreshed\n```\n\nA workaround seems to be:\n\n``` c\nglfwSetWindowMonitor(window, NULL, xpos, ypos, width, height, 0);\nglfwPollEvents();\nglfwSetWindowMonitor(window, NULL, xpos, ypos, width, height, 0);\n```\n\nI also randomly inserted a `_glfwPlatformPollEvents();` in `cocoa_window.m` after `_glfwInputWindowMonitorChange(window, monitor);` at line 1220. This also fixes the issue and produces the following output:\n\n```\nBEFORE RESTORE to: 520,176 - 640 x 480\n    BEFORE INNER POLL EVENTS\n11.455: Window moved to 0, 0\n11.456: Window framebuffer resized to 3300 x 2100\n11.459: Window refreshed\n    AFTER INNER POLL EVENTS\n11.510: Window framebuffer resized to 3300 x 2002\n11.511: Window resized to 1650 x 1001\n11.537: Window framebuffer resized to 3300 x 2002\n11.547: Window refreshed\n11.574: Window framebuffer resized to 1280 x 960\n11.574: Window resized to 640 x 480\n11.579: Window refreshed\nAFTER RESTORE\n```\n\nNote also that, even though with the workarounds the window ends-up in the correct shape, window position events are missing.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/glfw/glfw/issues/748/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/glfw/glfw/issues/748/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/glfw/glfw/issues/comments/227304283","html_url":"https://github.com/glfw/glfw/issues/682#issuecomment-227304283","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/glfw/glfw/issues/682","id":227304283,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIyNzMwNDI4Mw==","user":{"login":"mokafolio","id":10217168,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMjE3MTY4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10217168?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mokafolio","html_url":"https://github.com/mokafolio","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mokafolio/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mokafolio/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mokafolio/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mokafolio/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mokafolio/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mokafolio/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mokafolio/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mokafolio/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mokafolio/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-06-20T23:56:26Z","updated_at":"2016-06-21T00:28:31Z","body":"Does anybody know if this is fixed?

A animated triangel with different color per vertex. In fullscreen the window is black. The only thing I change between runs is the forth argument to glfwCreateWindow. Either it's nullptr for windowed mode or it's the monitor pointer for fullscreen.\r\n\r\nIf I change the fullscreen line to:\r\nwindow = glfwCreateWindow(3360, 2100, \"Simple example\", monitor, nullptr);\r\nThen I actually see the animated triangle but in't not centered. It is spinning in the bottom half of the screen. Also the frame buffer is then reported as:\r\nFramebuffer size w: 2560, h: 1600\r\n\r\nIf I change it to:\r\nwindow = glfwCreateWindow(2560, 1600, \"Simple example\", monitor, nullptr);\r\n\r\nI see just the tip of the spinning triangle at the bottom of the screen, most of it is outside. And the frame buffer is reported as:\r\nFramebuffer size w: 2048, h: 1280\r\n\r\nIsn't this strange.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/glfw/glfw/issues/953/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/glfw/glfw/issues/953/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":1015888848,"node_id":"MDE0OlVubGFiZWxlZEV2ZW50MTAxNTg4ODg0OA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/glfw/glfw/issues/events/1015888848","actor":{"login":"elmindreda","id":133714,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMzcxNA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/133714?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda","html_url":"https://github.com/elmindreda","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"unlabeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2017-03-27T00:41:04Z","label":{"name":"blocking","color":"fbca04"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/glfw/glfw/issues/comments/289511612","html_url":"https://github.com/glfw/glfw/issues/682#issuecomment-289511612","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/glfw/glfw/issues/682","id":289511612,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI4OTUxMTYxMg==","user":{"login":"elmindreda","id":133714,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMzcxNA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/133714?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda","html_url":"https://github.com/elmindreda","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-03-27T16:42:56Z","updated_at":"2017-03-27T16:42:56Z","body":"I started on this again today and found it had been fixed already.
