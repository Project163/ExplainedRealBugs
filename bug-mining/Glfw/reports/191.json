Before init() type glfwSetInputMode(window, GLFW_CURSOR, GLFW_CURSOR_DISABLED);\r\n- Defocus the window (i press the windows key) \r\n- Try to click the X button on the top bar\r\nResult: mouse gets recaptured and the window stays open\r\n\r\nI also tried calling glfwSetWindowFocusCallback and inside that function setting to GLFW_CURSOR_DISABLED when focused and GLFW_CURSOR_NORMAL when unfocused, but it made no difference besides the cursor being visible when hovering over the window while defocused.\r\n\r\nThis is unexpected behavior to me because the X button lights up making you think it can be clicked. Also, other games that capture the mouse let you close this way (none of the ones I tested use GLFW as far as I know).\r\n\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"elmindreda","id":133714,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMzcxNA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/133714?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda","html_url":"https://github.com/elmindreda","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/glfw/glfw/issues/1071/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/glfw/glfw/issues/1071/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
