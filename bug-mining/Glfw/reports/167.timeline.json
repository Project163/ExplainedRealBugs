you! That seems to explain every part of the behavior you describe.\r\n\r\nGLFW isn't listing your actual primary monitor because it doesn't have a display device (e.g.  `\"\\\\.\\DISPLAY1\\Monitor0\"`), but it doesn't switch to using adapter devices (e.g. `\"\\\\.\\DISPLAY1\"`) for GLFW monitors because the other adapter device _does_ have one (adapter device-only GLFW monitors has so far been a VMware specific workaround). Since the convention in GLFW is that the first monitor in the array is the primary one, the display device of the second adapter device implicitly becomes primary.\r\n\r\nAt this point I would like to know more about your \"Emacs\" monitor? What is it? Hardware or emulated? How is it connected? Is the Windows display dialog and/or device manager aware of it?
