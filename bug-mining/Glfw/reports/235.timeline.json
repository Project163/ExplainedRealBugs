From the [Cocoa Event Handling Guide](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/EventOverview/HandlingMouseEvents/HandlingMouseEvents.html):\r\n\r\n> By default, a mouse-down event in a window that isn’t the key window simply brings the window forward and makes it key; the event isn’t sent to the NSView object over which the mouse click occurs. The NSView can claim an initial mouse-down event, however, by overriding acceptsFirstMouse: to return YES. The argument of this method is the mouse-down event that occurred in the non-key window, which the view object can examine to determine whether it wants to receive the mouse event and potentially become first responder. You want the default behavior of this method in, for example, a control that affects the selected object in a window. However, in certain cases it’s appropriate to override this behavior, such as for controls that should receive mouseDown: messages even when the window is inactive. Examples of controls that support this click-through behavior are the title-bar buttons of a window.\r\n","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/glfw/glfw/issues/comments/364642551/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"GreenLightning","id":1459067,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0NTkwNjc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1459067?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/GreenLightning","html_url":"https://github.com/GreenLightning","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GreenLightning/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GreenLightning/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GreenLightning/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GreenLightning/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GreenLightning/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GreenLightning/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GreenLightning/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GreenLightning/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GreenLightning/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/glfw/glfw/issues/comments/364708659","html_url":"https://github.com/glfw/glfw/issues/1209#issuecomment-364708659","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/glfw/glfw/issues/1209","id":364708659,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM2NDcwODY1OQ==","user":{"login":"bsekura","id":7552761,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc1NTI3NjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7552761?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bsekura","html_url":"https://github.com/bsekura","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bsekura/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bsekura/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bsekura/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bsekura/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bsekura/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bsekura/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bsekura/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bsekura/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bsekura/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-02-11T00:40:29Z","updated_at":"2018-02-11T00:40:29Z","body":"Thank
