have written a simple app that uses the \"windowed full screen\" window, as described by the documentation: http://www.glfw.org/docs/latest/window.html#window_windowed_full_screen.\n\nThe window is correctly created and fills the whole monitor (which is the primary monitor obtained via glfwGetPrimaryMonitor(). I set the video mode parameters via the respective glfwWindowHint() function to those obtained via glfwGetVideoMode() of that monitor.\n\nNow, when the window is displayed on the monitor (which is an external monitor attached via DisplayPort), and when I then mouse-left-click on a different monitor (laptop display), the GLFW window is minimized and also glfwGetFramebufferSize() reports then 0, 0.\n\nI am on Windows 7 64-bit.\nAnd I was using a custom CMake / Visual Studio 2015 amd64 static library Build of GLFW git branch \"master\" on the current revision 4188c2...\n\nI think that even when mouse-clicking on the space of a different monitor, the GLFW window should stay intact on the other monitor.\n- Kai\n","closed_by":{"login":"elmindreda","id":133714,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMzcxNA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/133714?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda","html_url":"https://github.com/elmindreda","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/glfw/glfw/issues/447/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/glfw/glfw/issues/447/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
