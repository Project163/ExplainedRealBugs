used the code directly from the HTML guide for creating \"windowed full screen\" windows to modify the Boing demo application.  Specifically, I replaced this line:\r\n```c\r\n   window = glfwCreateWindow( 400, 400, \"Boing (classic Amiga demo)\", NULL, NULL );\r\n```\r\nwith the following code:\r\n```c\r\n   GLFWmonitor* monitor = glfwGetPrimaryMonitor();\r\n   const GLFWvidmode* mode = glfwGetVideoMode(monitor);\r\n   glfwWindowHint(GLFW_RED_BITS, mode->redBits);\r\n   glfwWindowHint(GLFW_GREEN_BITS, mode->greenBits);\r\n   glfwWindowHint(GLFW_BLUE_BITS, mode->blueBits);\r\n   glfwWindowHint(GLFW_REFRESH_RATE, mode->refreshRate);\r\n   window = glfwCreateWindow( mode->width, mode->height, \"Boing (classic Amiga demo)\", monitor, NULL );\r\n```\r\nThe fullscreen window is created correctly and initially works fine, but problems ensue when command-tabbing from and then back to the Boing application.  First, when command-tabbing from Boing to another application, the fullscreen window is iconified rather than simply hidden.  Second, a number of issues occur when command-tabbing back to the Boing application: (1) the fullscreen window remains iconified and does not reappear; (2) when you click on the Boing application in the Dock, the fullscreen window is de-iconified, but then is immediately hidden (and remains hidden) leaving you with only the menu bar; (3) if you then click anywhere but the menu bar, the fullscreen window re-appears, but then is immediately iconified.\r\n\r\nThis, at least, is the general behavior.  However, if you repeatedly command-tab back to the Boing application (or try to activate it by clicking on its icon in the Dock), the fullscreen window will sometimes no longer re-appear at all.\r\n\r\nDesirable behavior would be that the fullscreen window is simply hidden and then restored (rather than being iconified and de-iconified) when command-tabbing from and to the Boing application.  Also, it would be desirable to be able to disable command-tabbing when in fullscreen mode, particularly per a user's request.\r\n\r\nThis test was performed with the latest GLFW code (downloaded directly from GitHub on August 26, 2016) on a late 2011 MacBook Pro running OS X 10.11.6 and built with Xcode 7.3.1.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"elmindreda","id":133714,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMzcxNA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/133714?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda","html_url":"https://github.com/elmindreda","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/glfw/glfw/issues/848/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/glfw/glfw/issues/848/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
