`_glfw.ns.autoreleasePool` is drained and re-allocated on every call to `glfwPollEvents`. This is fine for most GLFW programs, i.e. doing memory clean-up once per frame.\n\nIt is a problem though for programs that only create (multiple) hidden GLFW windows for offscreen rendering/computation. Such programs may never call `glfwPollEvents`, there's never a need to and the documentation doesn't mention any memory-management side effects. The end result is that a lot of memory ends up leaking when the hidden windows are destroyed.\n\nThe proposal is that `glfwDestroyWindow` should also drain and re-allocate the `_glfw.ns.autoreleasePool`. This fixes the leak and there's no need to call `glfwPollEvents`.\n","closed_by":{"login":"elmindreda","id":133714,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMzcxNA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/133714?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda","html_url":"https://github.com/elmindreda","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/glfw/glfw/issues/721/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/glfw/glfw/issues/721/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
