#1173 is merged, libwayland-client will be the last Wayland-specific shared object GLFW links against.\r\n\r\nThe main issue with this library is that protocol headers, generated by `wayland-scanner` and provided either alongside libwayland for `wayland-client-protocol.h`, or built by GLFW (see e.g. `build/src/wayland-idle-inhibit-unstable-v1-client-protocol.h`), have `static inline` functions calling into it.\r\n\r\nI haven’t been able to figure out how to make those functions defined in the protocol header call our own function aliases, the ones defined in `_glfw.wl` and loaded during `glfwInit()`.\r\n\r\nTo make it worse, these protocol headers also depend on `wl_interface` symbols which aren’t functions, exported by libwayland-client.so or internal to GLFW for other protocols, and I haven’t been able to change them using our usual `#define` dance either.\r\n
