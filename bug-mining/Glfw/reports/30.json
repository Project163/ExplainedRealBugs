seems to have a problem with fullscreen modes if one screen is set on top of another (working in X11 with XRandr).\n\nI normally set up my screens like this: 'xrandr --output DVI-I-1 --auto --pos 0x0 --primary --output DVI-D-0 --below DVI-I-1 --output HDMI-0 --auto --pos 100x100'.  In english, that's a large 1920x1080 monitor (DVI-D-0) for my primary screen, another large 1920x1080 monitor (DVI-I-1) above the main screen for rendering output, and then a sub-region of the rendering screen which shows the output targeted at a small 1280x800 monitor (HDMI-0).  \n\nThe reason I'm superimposing my screens is because I'm doing software development for the Oculus Rift. It's viewed by the system as a monitor, but you can't really see normal desktop stuff through it very well, so having the output for it overlaid on one of my other monitors is usually helpful for debugging.\n\nHere's how it looks when I create a GLFW window using this code\n\n```\nglfwWindowHint(GLFW_DECORATED, 0);\nwindow = glfwCreateWindow(w, h, \"glfw\", NULL, NULL);\n```\n\nI see this:\n![Good Render](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/6620757/Screen1_small.png)\n\nBut when I try to do full screen with this code\n\n```\n  GLFWmonitor * target = ...;\n  window = glfwCreateWindow(w, h, \"glfw\", target, NULL);\n```\n\nI see this:\n![Bad Render](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/6620757/Screen2_small.png)\n\nThe Rift display is still showing the same sub-region of the top screen, meaning I see something approximately like this:\n\n![Bad Rift Render](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/6620757/Rift_small.png)\n\nWhen I don't do superimposition, but instead set the Rift outside the areas covered by the existing monitors, then I don't have a problem, and the Rift display looks correct. I'd rather not have to use xrandr to reset the screen layouts every time I want to test something for fullscreen.\n","closed_by":{"login":"elmindreda","id":133714,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMzcxNA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/133714?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda","html_url":"https://github.com/elmindreda","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/glfw/glfw/issues/175/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/glfw/glfw/issues/175/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
