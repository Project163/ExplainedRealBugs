like #228 and #229, in my application when it starts there is a pause during the call to [`_glfwSetVideoMode`](https://github.com/glfw/glfw/blob/4918514eafd620f63916c62c82a5c67636f64848/src/x11_monitor.c#L100). I discovered that if I prevented this call from happening, then I got the full screen window I wanted, but without the ugly pauses on startup and shutdown.\n\nTo fix this, I can set this hint in my application:\n\n``` c\nglfwWindowHint(glfw.RefreshRate, GLFW_DONT_CARE)\n```\n\nSo my question is: why isn't this the default? It seems that instead zero is being used as the default, which is causing it on my machine to pick a refresh rate of 40 instead of 60, hence requiring the mode change.\n\nFor the record, I'm using the version of glfw3 shipped with the go bindings on this commit: https://github.com/go-gl/glfw3/commit/552448f8d9d8f248f6764868fb8b75cb9ca45e97\n\nLabels: X11\n","closed_by":{"login":"elmindreda","id":133714,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMzcxNA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/133714?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda","html_url":"https://github.com/elmindreda","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/glfw/glfw/issues/354/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/glfw/glfw/issues/354/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
