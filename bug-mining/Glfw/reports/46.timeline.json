If I understand you correctly, the problem is that GLFW only exposes the \"screens\", not physical \"monitors\". But an external API you're using works with physical \"monitors\", and you're unable to correlate the two.\n\nGiven that it's not GLFW's business to be modifying anything to do with physical monitors (that's up to the user and the OS), it makes sense that the original API only exposed virtual screens (the domain where GLFW plays).\n\nI wonder how to best solve this. There's the approach of exposing physical screens (in read-only form) in GLFW, and another approach is get external APIs to use the virtual screens the way GLFW does.

was actually curious about that.  You do conversion of the WCHAR to standard char for the display name made available by glfwGetMonitorName, but that's presumably because the latter API is cross-platform, and so the wide characters would be unsuitable.  But might it not also be reasonable to provide this device string as a char \\* as well by using the same narrowing functionality, or alternatively using the ascii functions directly, like EnumDisplayDevicesA and DISPLAY_DEVICEA.  I'm a big fan of the views expressed at http://www.utf8everywhere.org/ and prefer avoiding touching non-8-bit chars if I can possibly avoid it.

This goes back to my original comments about the iteration of the monitors done in win32_monitors.c.  If I have a cloned display, the GLFW monitors only picks up one of the clones, whichever is at index 0, because it only ever calls EnumDisplayDevices for a given adapter with a 0 index:  https://github.com/glfw/glfw/blob/master/src/win32_monitor.c#L142\n\nThe display string from the output loop is something like ////.//DISPLAY0 ////.//DISPLAY1 while the inner loop provides names like ////.//DISPLAY1/Monitor0 and  ////.//DISPLAY1/Monitor1 (using forward slash cause git seems to be wigging out on backslash).  In the case of the cloned display, glfw will pretty much always return  ////.//DISPLAY1/Monitor0 for the cloned display, while the Oculus SDK might be returning ////.//DISPLAY1/Monitor1, because the former represents the monitor and the latter represents the actual Rift hardware.  \n\nThe only way I can see to resolve this would be for glfw to provide all the platform specific monitors in its list, regardless of whether they're cloned or not, essentially doing an inner loop in the win32_monitor.c function mentioned above, similar to the code in the first answer to this stack overflow question: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9524309/enumdisplaydevices-function-not-working-for-me\n\nThe downside is that multiple GLFW monitors will now be reporting the exact same video mode and positions.  An alternative might be a glfwFindMonitor(void *) that takes either a displayID or a char \\* (depending on the platform) and finds the GLFWmonitor that corresponds to the requested device string.  In the case of cloned displays it would have to be smart enough to do the two levels of EnumDisplayDevices and be able to correlate the device string provided with whichever monitor might be cloned to that display.\n","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/glfw/glfw/issues/comments/32222171/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"jherico","id":1533642,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MzM2NDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1533642?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jherico","html_url":"https://github.com/jherico","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jherico/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jherico/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jherico/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jherico/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jherico/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jherico/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jherico/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jherico/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jherico/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/glfw/glfw/issues/comments/32985767","html_url":"https://github.com/glfw/glfw/issues/212#issuecomment-32985767","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/glfw/glfw/issues/212","id":32985767,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMyOTg1NzY3","user":{"login":"elmindreda","id":133714,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMzcxNA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/133714?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda","html_url":"https://github.com/elmindreda","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-01-22T01:39:10Z","updated_at":"2014-01-22T01:39:10Z","body":"@jherico
