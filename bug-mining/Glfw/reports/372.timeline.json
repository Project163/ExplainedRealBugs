I can certainly understand that the broad platform specter to review and test for is a far larger burden on top of that again. \n\nPlease enlighten me if my conclusion is wrong, but I think it’s fine to remove support for these platforms for new and future versions of GLFW when taking into consideration the costs in supporting them.
