reports various valid video modes on a Mac Book Pro Retina 15\" early 2013:\n\n```\n640x480\n800x600\n1024x768\n1280x800\n1440x900\n1680x1050\n2048x1280\n2560x1600\n2880x1800\n```\n\nThe first issue is that not all possible resolutions are reported. Here's what the display really supports according to SwitchResX, which also allows setting those modes:\n\n![http://libgdx.badlogicgames.com/uploads/Screen%20Shot%202016-01-03%20at%2023.04.36-IOKaSoTsRz.png](http://libgdx.badlogicgames.com/uploads/Screen%20Shot%202016-01-03%20at%2023.04.36-IOKaSoTsRz.png)\n\nAs a test, i simply modified [simple.c](https://github.com/glfw/glfw/blob/master/examples/simple.c#L89), passing in any of the video mode resolutions that GLFW reports. Here's the results for various resolutions set in line 89, using the primary monitor:\n\n800x600\n![http://libgdx.badlogicgames.com/uploads/Screen%20Shot%202016-01-03%20at%2023.08.17-cGh6gJ3lSa.png](http://libgdx.badlogicgames.com/uploads/Screen%20Shot%202016-01-03%20at%2023.08.17-cGh6gJ3lSa.png)\n\n1280x800\n![http://libgdx.badlogicgames.com/uploads/Screen%20Shot%202016-01-03%20at%2023.09.25-wPQnDQ5anU.png](http://libgdx.badlogicgames.com/uploads/Screen%20Shot%202016-01-03%20at%2023.09.25-wPQnDQ5anU.png)\n\n1440x900\n![http://libgdx.badlogicgames.com/uploads/Screen%20Shot%202016-01-03%20at%2023.10.23-5ClAKXH3FU.png](http://libgdx.badlogicgames.com/uploads/Screen%20Shot%202016-01-03%20at%2023.10.23-5ClAKXH3FU.png)\n\n1680x1050\n![http://libgdx.badlogicgames.com/uploads/Screen%20Shot%202016-01-03%20at%2023.12.09-eKMd9CKkAH.png](http://libgdx.badlogicgames.com/uploads/Screen%20Shot%202016-01-03%20at%2023.12.09-eKMd9CKkAH.png)\n\n2880x1800\n![http://libgdx.badlogicgames.com/uploads/Screen%20Shot%202016-01-03%20at%2023.13.04-ZKSGzdRuxg.png](http://libgdx.badlogicgames.com/uploads/Screen%20Shot%202016-01-03%20at%2023.13.04-ZKSGzdRuxg.png)\n\nOnly 1440x900 and 2880x1800 work. This seemed a bit to convenient (the latter being a multiple of the former), so i checked my system settings. Low and behold:\n\n![http://libgdx.badlogicgames.com/uploads/Screen%20Shot%202016-01-03%20at%2023.13.50-aX6cYaLdof.png](http://libgdx.badlogicgames.com/uploads/Screen%20Shot%202016-01-03%20at%2023.13.50-aX6cYaLdof.png)\n\nIt looks only resolutions that are a multiple of the currently set screen resolution work. To test this theory, i set the current scaled resolution to this:\n\n![http://libgdx.badlogicgames.com/uploads/Screen%20Shot%202016-01-03%20at%2023.14.31-0SrT1qWnRp.png](http://libgdx.badlogicgames.com/uploads/Screen%20Shot%202016-01-03%20at%2023.14.31-0SrT1qWnRp.png)\n\nAnd as expected, only 1680x1050 worked, the others showed either a black screen or an incomplete triangle.\n\nThis must obviously have something to do with HDPI scaling. I used `GLFW_USE_RETINA` for this build.\n\nDisabling `GLFW_USE_RETINA` does not help:\n\n![http://libgdx.badlogicgames.com/uploads/Screen%20Shot%202016-01-03%20at%2023.20.31-Ow7SNCd1zE.png](http://libgdx.badlogicgames.com/uploads/Screen%20Shot%202016-01-03%20at%2023.20.31-Ow7SNCd1zE.png)\n\nI'd be happy to help any way i can to resolve this issue.\n","closed_by":{"login":"elmindreda","id":133714,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMzcxNA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/133714?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda","html_url":"https://github.com/elmindreda","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/glfw/glfw/issues/682/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/glfw/glfw/issues/682/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
