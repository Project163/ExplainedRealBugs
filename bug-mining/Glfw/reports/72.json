everyone,\nI want to iconify a fullscreen window. The problem is when I try to do it, something very strange happens: callback is called, GLFW window loses focus, other windows gain focus, but the black screen - the one that used to represent my fullscreen application - still remains. I mean, I still see my application and I can't see other windows until I do an Alt-Tab.\n\nP. S. Configuration: 2 monitors as 1 window, NVidia drivers 349.16, Linux Mint 17.1 Cinnamon 64-bit (2.4.8), X11\nP. P. S. And due to documentation, when glfwIconifyWindow is called, the original video mode should be restored. That does not happen.\n","closed_by":{"login":"elmindreda","id":133714,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMzcxNA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/133714?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda","html_url":"https://github.com/elmindreda","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/glfw/glfw/issues/531/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/glfw/glfw/issues/531/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
