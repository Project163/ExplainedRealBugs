[requested](https://github.com/glfw/glfw/issues/899#issuecomment-730074468):\r\n\r\nFrom #899, which was fixed to make `glfwMaximizeWindow()` maximize to workarea rather than to full screen size.\r\n\r\n> This is still an issue for windows created with glfwWindowHint(GLFW_MAXIMIZED, GLFW_TRUE) and glfwWindowHint(GLFW_DECORATED, GLFW_FALSE).\r\n> A possible workaround is to call glfwMaximizeWindow() after window creation.\r\n\r\nA similar fix as with https://github.com/glfw/glfw/commit/80d181f12dbb3b19fa649638252fa90eacf3d6a2 is required for the initial creation of the window here.\r\n\r\nBest,\r\nJonathan","closed_by":{"login":"elmindreda","id":133714,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMzcxNA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/133714?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda","html_url":"https://github.com/elmindreda","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/glfw/glfw/issues/1806/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/glfw/glfw/issues/1806/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
