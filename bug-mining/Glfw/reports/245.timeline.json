implementation is on my branch: https://github.com/felipefs/glfw/tree/workarea\r\n\r\nIt seems the only way to retrieve the work area of a monitor on Windows is by using the handle ```HMONITOR``` and the function ```GetMonitorInfo```. So far, the only way I know to get ```HMONITOR``` is by making a callback and pushing it to ```EnumDisplayMonitors```, but it would still require a way to match the ```HMONITOR``` with the specified ```_GLFWmonitor``` (which I don't know how to do in this case).\r\n\r\nHere is what I have so far (**updated**):\r\n```c\r\nstatic BOOL CALLBACK MonitorEnumProc(HMONITOR hMonitor, HDC hdcMonitor, LPRECT lprcMonitor, LPARAM dwData)\r\n{\r\n    RECT *workarea = (RECT *)dwData; /* How to correctly grab this pointer? */\r\n    MONITORINFO monitorInfo;\r\n    GetMonitorInfo(hMonitor, &monitorInfo); / * Are we sure that this hMonitor is correspondent to our _GLFWmonitor? */\r\n    workarea->left = monitorInfo.rcWork.left;\r\n    workarea->top = monitorInfo.rcWork.top;\r\n    workarea->right = monitorInfo.rcWork.right;\r\n    workarea->bottom = monitorInfo.rcWork.bottom;\r\n    return TRUE;\r\n}\r\n\r\nvoid _glfwPlatformGetMonitorWorkarea(_GLFWmonitor* monitor, int* xpos, int* ypos, int *width, int *height)\r\n{\r\n    HDC dc;\r\n    RECT workarea;\r\n\r\n    dc = CreateDCW(L\"DISPLAY\", monitor->win32.adapterName, NULL, NULL);\r\n\r\n    if (!EnumDisplayMonitors(dc, NULL, MonitorEnumProc, (LPARAM)&workarea)) /* We pass the workarea rect as pointer */\r\n        return;\r\n\r\n    DeleteDC(dc);\r\n\r\n    *xpos = workarea.left;\r\n    *ypos = workarea.top;\r\n    *width = workarea.right;\r\n    *height = workarea.bottom;\r\n}\r\n```\r\nI suppose I need to make ```data``` a type that will hold the sent ```_GLFWmonitor``` and hold the returned ```HMONITOR```. Anyone knows a better way than using this ugly callback?\r\n\r\n> @felipefs I'd prefer a single branch and PR per feature, but you can make a PR of it before implementing for all platforms if you prefer and then add new commits as needed.\r\n\r\nOk!","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/glfw/glfw/issues/comments/292304100/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"felselva","id":4709242,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3MDkyNDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4709242?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/felselva","html_url":"https://github.com/felselva","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/felselva/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/felselva/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/felselva/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/felselva/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/felselva/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/felselva/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/felselva/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/felselva/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/felselva/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":1032928602,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MTAzMjkyODYwMg==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/glfw/glfw/issues/events/1032928602","actor":{"login":"felselva","id":4709242,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3MDkyNDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4709242?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/felselva","html_url":"https://github.com/felselva","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/felselva/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/felselva/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/felselva/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/felselva/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/felselva/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/felselva/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/felselva/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/felselva/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/felselva/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2017-04-06T20:20:10Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":1032928603,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDEwMzI5Mjg2MDM=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/glfw/glfw/issues/events/1032928603","actor":{"login":"felselva","id":4709242,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3MDkyNDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4709242?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/felselva","html_url":"https://github.com/felselva","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/felselva/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/felselva/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/felselva/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/felselva/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/felselva/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/felselva/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/felselva/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/felselva/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/felselva/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2017-04-06T20:20:10Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/glfw/glfw/issues/comments/292386773","html_url":"https://github.com/glfw/glfw/issues/920#issuecomment-292386773","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/glfw/glfw/issues/920","id":292386773,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI5MjM4Njc3Mw==","user":{"login":"felselva","id":4709242,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3MDkyNDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4709242?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/felselva","html_url":"https://github.com/felselva","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/felselva/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/felselva/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/felselva/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/felselva/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/felselva/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/felselva/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/felselva/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/felselva/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/felselva/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-04-07T01:13:24Z","updated_at":"2017-04-07T19:12:55Z","body":"Aaand

patch has the implementation for querying the work area on X11 and Windows.\r\n\r\n- **The X11 implementation**. I believe everything is done with this implementation. I tested with single monitor, but since the monitor is passed directly to the function, I don't think there will be any problem with it.\r\n\r\n- **The Windows implementation**. This implementation surely needs test on multiple monitors. I tested with a single monitor, and the work area retrieved was correct. However, we need to make sure that the ```HMONITOR``` that we grab the information from matches the ```_GLFWmonitor``` passed to the function.\r\n\r\n- **The Cocoa implementation**. The implementation for Cocoa is a draft and needs to be test and reviewed.\r\n\r\nThis patch is related to the issue https://github.com/glfw/glfw/issues/920.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/glfw/glfw/issues/989/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":2,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/glfw/glfw/issues/989/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
