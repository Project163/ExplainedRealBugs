\r\n\r\nI rarely use cmake/make on my UNIX distributions, and as such I have limited knowledge to how to use said programs. I am a web dev trying to learn WebGL through OpenGL, and the formulation of the step \"Compiling the library\" on the page [Compiling GLFW](http://www.glfw.org/docs/latest/compile_guide.html#compile_deps_x11) is a bit obscure. \r\n\r\nI suggest that rather than the current:\r\n\r\n```md\r\n## Compiling the library\r\nYou should now have all required dependencies and the project files or makefiles necessary to compile GLFW.\r\nGo ahead and compile the actual GLFW library with these files, as you would with any other project.\r\n\r\n...\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe following be used:\r\n\r\n```md\r\n## Compiling the library\r\nYou should now have all required dependencies and the project files or makefiles necessary to compile GLFW.\r\nYou can now compile the GLFW library with these files. You can generally do so with \r\n\r\n\\```\r\ncd <glfw-root-dir>\r\nmake install\r\n\\```\r\n```\r\n\r\nCheers! 👍 ","closed_by":{"login":"elmindreda","id":133714,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMzcxNA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/133714?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda","html_url":"https://github.com/elmindreda","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/glfw/glfw/issues/1088/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/glfw/glfw/issues/1088/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
