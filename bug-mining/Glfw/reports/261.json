is a bug in how GLFW detects duplicate reported video modes in [_glfwPlatformGetVideoModes](https://github.com/glfw/glfw/blob/master/src/win32_monitor.c#L418), respectively _glfwCompareVideoModes and [compareVideoModes](https://github.com/glfw/glfw/blob/51bb76c7c3de934b2dd3affcdc297a32e4817835/src/monitor.c#L56-L57).\r\nWhen the OS reports both the resolutions 1920x1440 _and_ 2560x1080, then the latter will be [filtered out](https://github.com/glfw/glfw/blob/master/src/win32_monitor.c#L424) by GLFW since both resolutions have the same screen area (width x height) and are therefore considered equal, which is incorrect.","closed_by":{"login":"elmindreda","id":133714,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMzcxNA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/133714?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda","html_url":"https://github.com/elmindreda","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/glfw/glfw/issues/1555/reactions","total_count":3,"+1":3,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/glfw/glfw/issues/1555/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
