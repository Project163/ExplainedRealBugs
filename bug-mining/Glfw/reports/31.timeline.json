My instinct is always to ask for the current refresh rate and resolution, but why might I want different?\n\nIt depends on the application, really. Hence it is a choice. Most applications default to the current screen mode, yes.\n\nAn example of when you might want something different, is if your application is fill-rate limited: rendering at a lower screen resolution (e.g. half) would reduce visual quality, obviously, but would also improve performance (some console games do this for instance).\n\n> The problem with picking something other than what's set with GLFW_DONT_CARE is that it will cause a mode change and potentially graphical glitches.\n\nNo graphical glitches should occur, if they do then it's a bug in the graphics driver and.. well.. there isn't anything you can do about that except report it to the respective driver developers.\n\nThat being said, if you want to explicitly avoid these buggy drivers going with the current screen mode is a good choice.\n","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/glfw/glfw/issues/comments/60078406/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"emidoots","id":3173176,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxNzMxNzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3173176?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/emidoots","html_url":"https://github.com/emidoots","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emidoots/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emidoots/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emidoots/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emidoots/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emidoots/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emidoots/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emidoots/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emidoots/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emidoots/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":301369290,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDMwMTM2OTI5MA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/glfw/glfw/issues/events/301369290","actor":{"login":"Scorpiour","id":4977956,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5Nzc5NTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4977956?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scorpiour","html_url":"https://github.com/Scorpiour","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scorpiour/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scorpiour/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scorpiour/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scorpiour/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scorpiour/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scorpiour/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scorpiour/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scorpiour/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Scorpiour/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"9f1a6a6aa9560c6785a36750786c094694b0b844","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Scorpiour/glfw/commits/9f1a6a6aa9560c6785a36750786c094694b0b844","created_at":"2015-05-11T03:19:15Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
