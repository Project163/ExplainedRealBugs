include GLFW directly in my own CMAKE project, and I noticed that the Visual Studio solution has lots of GLFW projects in it which add noise to the overall view of my project.\n\nIf you add the FOLDER property to set_target_properties, the GLFW projects can be grouped together making it much easier to see your own projects.  My suggested changes are the following:\n\nglfw/src/CMakeLists.txt:\nset_target_properties(glfw PROPERTIES OUTPUT_NAME \"${GLFW_LIB_NAME}\" FOLDER \"GLFW3/glfw\")\n\nglfw/examples/CMakeLists.txt:\nset_target_properties(${WINDOWS_BINARIES} PROPERTIES\n                                   LINK_FLAGS \"/ENTRY:mainCRTStartup\" FOLDER \"GLFW3/Examples\")\n\nglfw/tests/CMakeLists.txt:\nset_target_properties(${WINDOWS_BINARIES} ${CONSOLE_BINARIES} PROPERTIES\n                                   LINK_FLAGS \"/ENTRY:mainCRTStartup\" FOLDER \"GLFW3/Tests\")\n\nA user would then put the following near the top of their own CMakeLists.txt (I put it just under project(MyProject) ):\nset_property(GLOBAL PROPERTY USE_FOLDERS ON)\n\nThis makes the Visual Studio solution have a folder called GLFW3, under which are 3 more folders (Examples, glfw and Tests) which in turn contain their respective projects.\n\nI've tested this locally and it works just fine, though I'm not sure if you'd need to do more work for shared libraries or not (I'm using static libraries), and possibly this could also work for other IDEs?  I'm not an expert in CMAKE by any means, but this seems like a very cheap win.\n","closed_by":{"login":"elmindreda","id":133714,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMzcxNA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/133714?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda","html_url":"https://github.com/elmindreda","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/glfw/glfw/issues/328/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/glfw/glfw/issues/328/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
