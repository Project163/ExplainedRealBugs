change leads to some problems in conjunction with cairo, which uses `Window` to create surfaces in its GLX backend.\n\nI create a cairo surface for a GLFW window using `cairo_glx_device_create(Display *, GLXcontext)` and `cairo_gl_surface_create_for_window(cairo_device_t*, Window, int, int)`, which fails with an X error in `X_GLXMakeContextCurrent` on the first call to `cairo_paint`. This does not happen before commit 962497b.\n\nDoes this change somehow disassociate the GLX surface from the X11 Window? Is cairo at fault for using `Window` instead of `GLXWindow` here?\n\nI tested on Arch Linux, Intel(R) Ivybridge Mobile GPU, Mesa 11.2.2, OpenGL 3.0 using [this minimal test gist](https://gist.github.com/tobyp/53fbf1bdff40bbda8f2509a73821f07e)\n","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/glfw/glfw/issues/comments/234582419/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"tobyp","id":2053684,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwNTM2ODQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2053684?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tobyp","html_url":"https://github.com/tobyp","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tobyp/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tobyp/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tobyp/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tobyp/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tobyp/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tobyp/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tobyp/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tobyp/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tobyp/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/glfw/glfw/issues/comments/234584204","html_url":"https://github.com/glfw/glfw/issues/507#issuecomment-234584204","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/glfw/glfw/issues/507","id":234584204,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIzNDU4NDIwNA==","user":{"login":"tobyp","id":2053684,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwNTM2ODQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2053684?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tobyp","html_url":"https://github.com/tobyp","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tobyp/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tobyp/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tobyp/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tobyp/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tobyp/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tobyp/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tobyp/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tobyp/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tobyp/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-07-22T16:01:45Z","updated_at":"2016-07-22T16:01:45Z","body":"On Intel grarphics, the aforementioned X error occurs.
