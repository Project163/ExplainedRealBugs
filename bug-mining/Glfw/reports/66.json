using multiple windows on OS X Yosemite, creating a fullscreen window after non-fullscreen windows seems to destroy existing OpenGL context.\n\nFor example, the following code creates a non-fullscreen window `w0`, a fullscreen window `w1`, and a non-fullscreen window `w2`:\n\n```\n#include <GLFW/glfw3.h>\n#include <cstdio>\n\nint main()\n{\n        glfwInit();\n\n        GLFWmonitor *m = glfwGetPrimaryMonitor();\n\n        GLFWwindow *w0 = glfwCreateWindow(640,  480, \"0\", NULL, NULL);\n        printf(\"%s\\n\", glGetString(GL_VERSION)); // an OpenGL context is available\n\n        GLFWwindow *w1 = glfwCreateWindow(1440, 900, \"1 buggy\", m, w0);\n        printf(\"%s\\n\", glGetString(GL_VERSION)); // the existing OpenGL context is gone.  Is this a bug?\n\n        GLFWwindow *w2 = glfwCreateWindow(640,  480, \"2\", NULL, w1);\n        printf(\"%s\\n\", glGetString(GL_VERSION)); // an OpenGL context is available again\n\n        while(!glfwWindowShouldClose(w0) &&\n              !glfwWindowShouldClose(w1) &&\n              !glfwWindowShouldClose(w2))\n                glfwPollEvents();\n\n        glfwTerminate();\n\n        return 0;\n}\n```\n\nThe code outputs:\n\n```\n2.1 NVIDIA-10.2.7 310.41.25f01\n(null)\n2.1 NVIDIA-10.2.7 310.41.25f01\n```\n\nAfter the creation of `w0`, a valid OpenGL context is available as expected and `glGetString(GL_VERSION)` gives the correct OpenGL version string.  However, with the creation of `w1`, the existing OpenGL context gets destroyed (or become inactive).  Calling OpenGL functions may crash the program.  And `glGetString(GL_VERSION)` gives a `null`.  Creating a non-fullscreen window `w2` fixes this problem and a valid OpenGL context becomes available again.\n\nThis problem can also be fixed by calling `glfwMakeContextCurrent(w1);` right after the creation of `w1`.  However, is this an expected behavior?  Or is it a bug?\n","closed_by":{"login":"elmindreda","id":133714,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMzcxNA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/133714?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda","html_url":"https://github.com/elmindreda","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/glfw/glfw/issues/500/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/glfw/glfw/issues/500/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
