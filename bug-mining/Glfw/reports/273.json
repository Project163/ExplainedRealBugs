at VisPy we are using GLFW and noticed [some X failures](https://travis-ci.org/vispy/vispy/jobs/633974644#L7788) on Linux x86_64 platforms (at least). When using a window without decoration (with decoration things are fine), I get an X Error code:\r\n```\r\nX Error of failed request:  BadWindow (invalid Window parameter)\r\n  Major opcode of failed request:  40 (X_TranslateCoords)\r\n  Resource id in failed request:  0x0\r\n  Serial number of failed request:  242\r\n  Current serial number in output stream:  242\r\n```\r\n`git bisect` tells me that the offending commit is:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/glfw/glfw/commit/fe57e3c2921a1901390534e1e51053df70b5644b\r\n\r\nWhich at least makes some sense since there is a call to XTranslateCoordinates in there.\r\n\r\nI am a X and GLFW novice and my C debugging skills are not the best, but happy to help provide more information or try anything that might help.","closed_by":{"login":"elmindreda","id":133714,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMzcxNA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/133714?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda","html_url":"https://github.com/elmindreda","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/glfw/glfw/issues/1620/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/glfw/glfw/issues/1620/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
