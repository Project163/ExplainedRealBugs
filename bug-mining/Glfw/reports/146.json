came up in the context of cyglfw3, which is a python wrapper for GLFW3 written in cython. See https://github.com/adamlwgriffiths/cyglfw3/issues/22.\n\nPython2.7 uses a relatively old version of MSVC that does not include stdint.h. This means that any program (or in this case a CPython C extension) that includes glfw3.h won't compile with this version of MSVC because no stdint.h is available out of the box.\n\nI was able to work around this by adding a version of stdint.h to the includes directory of the GLFW binary distribution. To restore compatibility with this older version of MSVC, GLFW either needs to include a windows-specific version of stdint.h that only gets included on older versions of MSVC or drop the stdint.h import entirely.\n","closed_by":{"login":"elmindreda","id":133714,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMzcxNA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/133714?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda","html_url":"https://github.com/elmindreda","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/glfw/glfw/issues/821/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/glfw/glfw/issues/821/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
