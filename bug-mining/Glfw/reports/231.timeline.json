Weston, I don’t plan on supporting old versions as it isn’t a desktop environment and thus not something most users will end up using as their daily driver, and because this `wl_scaler` protocol would have to be embedded in GLFW’s sources rather than pulled from wayland-protocols.\r\n\r\nFor Kwin and possibly other compositors, a totally different approach could be used, where GLFW would instead ask the compositor to decorate our window itself, I’m only waiting for the protocol to end up in wayland-protocols, see: https://github.com/glfw/glfw/pull/1161#issuecomment-361238461\r\n\r\nEdit: I

trying to create a simple window using GLFW (master) using a Vulkan surface on Wayland (Sway 1.0beta2, but also having issues on the Weston reference compositor and Gnome Wayland). The below code is a minimal example, and has been ported from macOS (using MoltenVK) where it works fine and shows a blank window as expected.\r\n\r\nThe code runs and gives the following output: \r\n```\r\nGLFW 3.3.0 Wayland EGL clock_gettime evdev shared\r\nCreated GLFW window\r\nExtensions: VH_KHR_surface VH_KHR_wayland_surface\r\nCreated Vulkan instance\r\nVulkan surface created\r\n```\r\nHowever the window is not shown. If I try the code from https://github.com/glfw/glfw/blob/master/tests/vulkan.c (which creates a render loop) a window is created as expected. This may be a feature rather than a bug but I'm confused as to why it would work on macOS but not Wayland.\r\n\r\n```C\r\n#include <stdio.h>\r\n#include <stdlib.h>\r\n#include <string.h>\r\n#include
