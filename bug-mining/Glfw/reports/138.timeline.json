I have tested this on both DWM 6.1-3 and also on XUbuntu 16.04 LTS running XFCE 4.12 (with XFWM 4.12). I don't exactly know what values should be correct, but `GetWindowPos` returns the screen position of the client area, while a `SetWindowPosCallback` returns (x, y)-values of the actual window (client area + decorations). Below follows some observations.\n\nExample: DWM 6.1-3 has only a one pixel border decoration, `GetWindowPos` gives me (1, 1) whenever I call `SetWindowPos` with (0, 0), while `SetWindowPosCallback` give me the values (0, 0). According to the documentation, `GetWindowPos` and `SetWindowPosCallback` should be returning the _screen coordinates_ (the X11 root) of the _client area_ (the framebuffer) implying (1, 1)? ~~Meaning (if everything I have said and measured is correct), that both `SetWindowPos` and `SetWindowPosCallback` aren't correctly setting, and getting the position (not accounting for the window decorations), doing everything relative to a _window_~~.\n\nIf you would like to try this yourselves to indeed confirm this, I have made a small test program that will print the values of both `GetWindowPos` and `SetWindowPosCallback` whenever a window position event has happened. Hopefully (if this bug indeed exists), the values in each line should't match, whenever a displacement happens. Also, pressing 'T' will call `SetWindowPos`, try to assert that both `GetWindowPos` and `SetWindowPosCallback` return the same (x, y)-value, which should fail right now if there is a bug. The testing program: https://gist.github.com/CaffeineViking/8a8d1c77938070b86f3c5293d1a2cbba\n\nFinally, the patch provided by @Draghi [Draghi/glfw](https://github.com/Draghi/glfw) seems to fix the position inconsistency between `GetWindowPos` and `SetWindowPosCallback`, which now return the same value in my testing program. However, something fishy happens when attempting to call `SetWindowPos` and then querying either `GetWindowPos` or `SetWindowPosCallback`, at least for me. Both of these return positions which are double what they should really be. I don't why, but this happens on my setup. I'll investigate further.\n\nAnway, good work finding this bug @Draghi! Let's see if we can both figure out what's wrong here.\nUPDATE: I can also verify that the behaviour in XFWM is what @Draghi described, bit unlike DWM, additionally the patch seems to work a lot better now on XFWM, it doesn't return crazy values now.\n","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/glfw/glfw/issues/comments/229717167/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"CaffeineViking","id":5418661,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0MTg2NjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5418661?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/CaffeineViking","html_url":"https://github.com/CaffeineViking","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CaffeineViking/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CaffeineViking/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CaffeineViking/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CaffeineViking/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CaffeineViking/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CaffeineViking/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CaffeineViking/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CaffeineViking/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CaffeineViking/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":709427186,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50NzA5NDI3MTg2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/glfw/glfw/issues/events/709427186","actor":{"login":"notverymoe","id":5101853,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxMDE4NTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5101853?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/notverymoe","html_url":"https://github.com/notverymoe","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/notverymoe/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/notverymoe/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/notverymoe/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/notverymoe/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/notverymoe/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/notverymoe/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/notverymoe/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/notverymoe/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/notverymoe/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2016-06-30T16:44:50Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":709427187,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDcwOTQyNzE4Nw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/glfw/glfw/issues/events/709427187","actor":{"login":"notverymoe","id":5101853,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxMDE4NTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5101853?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/notverymoe","html_url":"https://github.com/notverymoe","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/notverymoe/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/notverymoe/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/notverymoe/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/notverymoe/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/notverymoe/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/notverymoe/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/notverymoe/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/notverymoe/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/notverymoe/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2016-06-30T16:44:50Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/glfw/glfw/issues/comments/229830676","html_url":"https://github.com/glfw/glfw/issues/800#issuecomment-229830676","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/glfw/glfw/issues/800","id":229830676,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIyOTgzMDY3Ng==","user":{"login":"notverymoe","id":5101853,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxMDE4NTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5101853?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/notverymoe","html_url":"https://github.com/notverymoe","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/notverymoe/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/notverymoe/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/notverymoe/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/notverymoe/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/notverymoe/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/notverymoe/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/notverymoe/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/notverymoe/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/notverymoe/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"

I think it would be best to wait @elmindreda's verdict on this, if this has happened before, chances are, changes to these might break behaviour for the other people too (leading to an endless loop of issues coming back up, fixing back and forth for specific WMs).\n\nUPDATE: I have further tested @Draghi's patch on various other distributions and window managers, it seems to behave correctly (after said patch). Without this patch, the behaviour is as @Draghi describes it, where `GetWindowPos` and `SetWindowPosCallback` don't match up, where only `SetWindowPosCallback` seems to retrieve the _screen relative_ _client area_ position, and `GetWindowPos` the actual _window position_. My tests have taken place with the previosly mentioned testing program on the following different setup:\n- Fedora 24 Workstation with the GNOME 3.20 DE and the Mutter 3.20 WM.\n- Linux Mint 18 with the Cinnamon 3.0 DE and the Muffin 3.0.5 WM.\n- XUbuntu 16.04 with the XFCE 4.12 DE and the XFWM 4.12 WM.\n\nAll of the above combinations display this bug (at least in the way I'm testing). By using the given patch, these issues seem to have been remedied. The mentioned functions now seem to comply with the doc. However, `SetWindowPos` still behaves funky on my DWM 6.1-3 setup, I will try to investigate this

@elmindreda's branch on various different systems. Below follow some short summaries of the observations I've made _before_ and _after_ applying the fix at the `x11-windowpos` branch. Might try more..\n- **XUbuntu 16.04 + XFCE 4.12 + XFWM 4.12:** before `x11-windowpos` both _polled_ and _callback_ values didn't match up. _Polled_ returned _window-relative_ positions, while _callbacks_ did return a _client-relative_. After applying `x11-windowpos` both _polled_ and _callback_ values return _client-relative_ positions. **Nice!!**\n- **Fedora 24 Workstation + GNOME 3.20 + Mutter 3.20:** before `x11-windowpos` _polled_ values return some _mystery-relative_ position, idk, while _callbacks_ returned the correct _client-relative_ positions. So, after applying `x11-windowpos`, _polled_ and _callback_ report the correct _client-relative_ positions. **Nice!!**\n- **Linux Mint 18 + Cinnamon 3.0 + Muffin 3.0.5:** before applying `x11-windowpos`, the _polled_ values returned _window-relative_ (i.e. with decorations) positions and _callbacks_ returned _client-relative_ area. After applying `x11-windowpos`, both _polled_ and _callbacks_ return the _client-relative_ positions. **Nice!!!**\n- **EDIT: OpenSUSE 42.1 + KDE Plasma 5.4.2 + KWin 5.4.2:** before `x11-windowpos` _polled_ values did return _window-relative_ positions, while _callbacks_ returned _client-relative_ values. After the patch, both _polled_ and _callback_ values seem to return the correct _client-relative_ positions. **Seems Nice Too!** :+1:
