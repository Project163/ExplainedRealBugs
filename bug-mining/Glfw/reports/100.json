Mint 17.2 (kernel 4.1.6).\n\nHaving a problem where all the joystick devices provided by udev are enumerated from last-to-first by GLFW.  So if I have 4 joystick devices, GFWL will expose the _highest_ enumerated /dev/input/js\\* (or /dev/input/event*) device provided by udev as joy[0]/GLFW_JOYSTICK_1.\n\nConsistently able to produce this output:\n/dev/input/js0  ->  /dev/input/event19  ->  GLFW_JOYSTICK_4 (joy[3])\n/dev/input/js1  ->  /dev/input/event20  ->  GLFW_JOYSTICK_3 (joy[2])\n/dev/input/js2  ->  /dev/input/event21  ->  GLFW_JOYSTICK_2 (joy[1])\n/dev/input/js3  ->  /dev/input/event22  ->  GLFW_JOYSTICK_1 (joy[0])\n\nReproduced on three machines running Mint 17.2, using both Hidromancer and the kernel xboxdrv.  Built GLFW from source using master; BUILD_SHARED_LIBS ON, RelWithDebInfo.\n\nI haven't experience this behaviour with any other application.  evtest, jstest-gtk and every other game and API (SD2/SFML/libudev) seems to address them in the correct order.  I verified GLFW_JOYSTICK_n macros are all correct.\n","closed_by":{"login":"elmindreda","id":133714,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMzcxNA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/133714?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda","html_url":"https://github.com/elmindreda","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/glfw/glfw/issues/654/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/glfw/glfw/issues/654/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
