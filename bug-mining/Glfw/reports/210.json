am working on better multi-windows support for dear imgui backends. To make cross-window drag and drop patterns easy to implement in a portable manner (bypassing the full OS machinery which is incredibly complicated for the end-user) I found it necessary to be able to query whether a window is being hovered by the mouse, regardless of it being focused or not. As far as I know this is not currently possible with GLFW. It's also not something we can track/compute without the window manager assistance.\r\n\r\n(Context, this is my use case: https://twitter.com/ocornut/status/946470996529336321 )\r\n\r\nIn the Win32 code, this information is currently provided by the function:\r\n`static GLFWbool cursorInClientArea(_GLFWwindow* window)`\r\n\r\nI don't know about other supported platforms, but may I suggest exposing it in GLFW?\r\nA suggestion would be to add an additional GLFW_HOVERED attribute that could be queried with:\r\n`glfwGetWindowAttrib(window, GLFW_HOVERED)`\r\n\r\nI could work on a PR for Win32 if useful but I don't have easy access nor knowledge of other platforms.\r\n\r\nThank you,\r\nOmar\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"elmindreda","id":133714,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMzcxNA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/133714?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda","html_url":"https://github.com/elmindreda","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/glfw/glfw/issues/1166/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/glfw/glfw/issues/1166/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
