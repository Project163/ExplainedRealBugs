noticed if you hook up `glfwSetCharCallback` (or `glfwSetCharModsCallback`), then HOLD DOWN a letter key—\"Q\" for example—the callback only gets called once, and never repeats.\r\n\r\nBut if you hold down another key—let's say \"E\"—it DOES repeat, which I would expect to be the correct behavior.\r\n\r\nThe only pattern I can figure that determines which keys repeat and which don't is that keys that normally have a little diacritics popup (see picture) DO repeat, and keys that don't have that popup, don't repeat.\r\n\r\n![screen shot 2017-05-08 at 3 48 35

results. I'll do a little more research, like if [disabling that popup](http://osxdaily.com/2011/08/04/enable-key-repeat-mac-os-x-lion/) changes this behavior.\r\n\r\nIt should also be noted that this only seems to affect `glfwSetCharCallback` and `glfwSetCharModsCallback`. `glfwSetKeyCallback` seems to function normally and repeats for all keys when held.\r\n\r\nTest code:\r\n```\r\n// main.cpp\r\n#include <GLFW/glfw3.h>\r\n#include <iostream>\r\n\r\nvoid charCallback(GLFWwindow * window, unsigned int codepoint, int mods) {\r\n    std::cout << \"char callback called with codepoint \" << codepoint << std::endl;\r\n}\r\n\r\nint main(void)\r\n{\r\n    GLFWwindow* window;\r\n\r\n    if (!glfwInit())\r\n        return -1;\r\n\r\n    window = glfwCreateWindow(640, 480, \"Hello World\", NULL, NULL);\r\n    if (!window)\r\n    {\r\n        glfwTerminate();\r\n        return -1;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    glfwMakeContextCurrent(window);\r\n\r\n    glfwSetCharModsCallback(window, charCallback);\r\n\r\n    while (!glfwWindowShouldClose(window))\r\n    {\r\n        glClear(GL_COLOR_BUFFER_BIT);\r\n        glfwSwapBuffers(window);\r\n        glfwPollEvents();\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    glfwTerminate();\r\n    return 0;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nBuilt and run with:\r\n`clang++ main.cpp -I . -L . -lglfw3 -framework Cocoa -framework IOKit -framework CoreVideo -framework OpenGL -o glfwbugtest && ./glfwbugtest`\r\nWhere the GLFW includes folder and libglfw3.a are in the same directory as main.cpp.","closed_by":{"login":"elmindreda","id":133714,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMzcxNA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/133714?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda","html_url":"https://github.com/elmindreda","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/glfw/glfw/issues/1010/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/glfw/glfw/issues/1010/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
