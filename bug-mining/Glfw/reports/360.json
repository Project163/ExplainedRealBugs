macOS keyboard generates a code for the \"fn\" key, though GLFW has no support for function keys.\r\nIs it possible to understand this key instead of returning an error?\r\n\r\nThis is a poor workaround that I have played with at the top of _glfwPlatformGetScancodeName :\r\n```c\r\n    if (scancode == 0x3F) { // macOS \"fn\" key\r\n        return NULL; // No GLFW support for Function
