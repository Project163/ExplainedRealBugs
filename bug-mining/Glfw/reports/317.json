trying to build up `glfw` from source on Ubuntu 20.04. It's a remote machine in which I'm only a normal user. At the `cmake` phase, it complains that it could not find `Xcursor`. I found that the complaint arises from line 209 of `src/CMakeLists.txt`:\r\n```\r\nif (NOT X11_Xcursor_INCLUDE_PATH)\r\n```\r\nSo, I installed `Xcursor`’s development package `libxcursor-dev`, among others, in my user space folder `.bin`. Then I set the value of `X11_Xcursor_INCLUDE_PATH` to the path containing the header file `X11/Xcursor/Xcursor.h`, i.e., the parent directory of X11, by `-D` command-line option of `cmake`:\r\n```\r\ncmake --clean-first .. .  <many other variables> -DX11_Xcursor_INCLUDE_PATH=$HOME/.bin/usr/include\r\n```\r\nAfter that, cmake finished successfully.\r\n\r\nThen, at the `make` phase, however, I received an error:\r\n```\r\n[  1%] Building C object src/CMakeFiles/glfw.dir/context.c.o\r\nIn file included from $HOME/testglfw/glfw/src/platform.h:62,\r\n                 from $HOME/testglfw/glfw/src/internal.h:330,\r\n                 from$HOME/testglfw/glfw/src/context.c:30:\r\n$HOME/testglfw/glfw/src/x11_platform.h:36:10: fatal error: X11/Xcursor/Xcursor.h: No such file or directory\r\n   36 | #include <X11/Xcursor/Xcursor.h>\r\n      |          ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\r\ncompilation terminated.\r\n```\r\nMy question is: since I have told `cmake` the directory containing `Xcursor`'s header `X11/Xcursor/Xcursor.h` via variable `X11_Xcursor_INCLUDE_PATH`, why can’t cmake set the `gcc`'s `-I` option accordingly? Does the `glfw` source code attempt to form the `-I` option in generated Makefile using values in `X11_Xcursor_INCLUDE_PATH` variable? If so, did I miss anything in the `cmake` phase for this purpose? If not, I'd like to request add this function to the glfw source, that is, when generating Makefile, the `gcc` command line can read the value of `X11_Xcursor_INCLUDE_PATH` variable as an extra include path for `#include <X11/Xcursor/Xcursor.h>`, if the user has specified this in `cmake` command line.\r\n\r\nPS, I know I can set environment variable to specify additional include path during make, but I just want to know whether I can use the value of `X11_Xcursor_INCLUDE_PATH` variable set in `cmake` command line to specify this, and request this function to `glfw` source if not. Thanks.","closed_by":{"login":"elmindreda","id":133714,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMzcxNA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/133714?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda","html_url":"https://github.com/elmindreda","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/glfw/glfw/issues/1999/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/glfw/glfw/issues/1999/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
