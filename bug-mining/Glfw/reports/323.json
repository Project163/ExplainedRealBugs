times to times, the empty event posted by a call to `glfwPostEmptyEvent` won't unblock a call to `glfwWaitEvent` in the main thread.\r\n\r\nA minimal program reproducing the issue [is available here](https://github.com/OlivierSohn/repro-evt)\r\nIt can be built and run on linux like so:\r\n```g++ main.cpp -std=c++14 -lglfw -lX11 -ldl -lpthread && ./a.out```\r\n\r\nIf the calls of `glfwPostEmptyEvent` and `glfwWaitEvent` don't overlap in time, then the bug will never happen, but if the 2 calls are concurrent, the bug happens, \"sometimes\".\r\n\r\nNote that on OSX, this bug never happens.\r\n\r\nGLFW Version (from glfwGetVersionString()):\r\n`3.2.1 X11 GLX EGL clock_gettime /dev/js Xf86vm shared`\r\n\r\nUbuntu version\r\n`18.04 LTS`\r\n\r\n- Note that I have tried posting \"several\" empty events at the same time: it doesn't help either, it just makes the bug a little less reproducible but doesnt fix it entirely.\r\n\r\nEdit : added the build command\r\nEdit2 : fixed the build
