docs of [`glfwSwapBuffers`](http://www.glfw.org/docs/latest/group__window.html#ga15a5a1ee5b3c2ca6b15ca209a12efd14) say that this call will vsync (to it's best ability in windowed mode i guess) if the swap interval is > 0.\n\nThis works if the window is partially visible (either full-screen or windowed mode). It actually doesn't \"vsync\" if the window is fully covered by another window or if the window is minimized. Is this by design? Only tested on Mac OS X.\n\nI'm not sure if this could/should be \"fixed\" in GLFW or if it's the responsibility of the application to take care of it. However, it should at least be documented in the glfwSwapBuffers docs that no vsync'ing happens in case the window is fully covered or minimized.\n","closed_by":{"login":"elmindreda","id":133714,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMzcxNA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/133714?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda","html_url":"https://github.com/elmindreda","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/glfw/glfw/issues/680/reactions","total_count":5,"+1":5,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/glfw/glfw/issues/680/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
