latest workaround for vsync'ed buffer swapping on systems with compositing enabled leads to stuttering when in fullscreen mode. In windowed mode it's working fine. \n\nI have three different test machines. \n\n1) XP with a Radeon 9250\n2) Vista with an ATI Mobility Radeon HD 2400 XT\n3) Windows 7 with an AMD Radeon HD 6450\n\nOn machine 1 it's working correctly in both windowed and fullscreen mode. On machines 2 and 3 only windowed mode is good. In fullscreen mode the movement is clearly not smooth and there's some stuttering / refresh artifacts.\n\nHere's the test code that I used:\n\n```\n#include <stdio.h>\n#include <stdlib.h>\n#include <string.h>\n\n#include <windows.h>\n\n#include <GLFW/glfw3.h>\n\nint main(void)\n{\n    GLFWwindow* window;\n    int i = 0, mode = 0;\n    GLFWmonitor **mons;\n    int count;\n\n    if(!glfwInit()) return -1;\n\n    mons = glfwGetMonitors(&count);\n\n    window = glfwCreateWindow(640, 480, \"Hello World\", *mons, NULL);\n    if(!window) {\n        glfwTerminate();\n        return -1;\n    }\n\n    glfwMakeContextCurrent(window);\n    glfwSwapInterval(1);\n\n    glMatrixMode(GL_PROJECTION);\n    glLoadIdentity();\n    glOrtho(0, 640, 0, 480, -1, 1);     \n    glDisable(GL_DEPTH_TEST);\n    glDisable(GL_BLEND);    \n    glDisable(GL_TEXTURE_2D);   \n    glMatrixMode(GL_MODELVIEW);\n    glLoadIdentity();\n\n    glColor3f(1.0, 1.0, 1.0);\n\n    while(!glfwWindowShouldClose(window)) {\n\n        glClear(GL_COLOR_BUFFER_BIT|GL_DEPTH_BUFFER_BIT);\n        glRecti(i, 190, i + 100, 290);      \n\n        glfwSwapBuffers(window);\n        glfwPollEvents();\n\n        if(!mode) {\n            i++;\n            if(i >= 539) mode = 1;\n        } else {\n            i--;\n            if(i <= 0) mode = 0;\n        }           \n    }\n\n    glfwTerminate();\n\n    return 0;\n} \n```\n\nIt simply moves a white box from left to right and back again. The aim is to have it moving without any refresh artefacts. Currently this only happens on the XP machine. On Vista and 7 it's stuttering with refresh artefacts in fullscreen mode. In windowed mode it works perfectly on all three systems.\n","closed_by":{"login":"elmindreda","id":133714,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMzcxNA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/133714?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda","html_url":"https://github.com/elmindreda","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/glfw/glfw/issues/519/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/glfw/glfw/issues/519/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
