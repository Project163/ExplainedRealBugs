left or right thumbstick on my Xbox 360 controller is located to the far bottom left (i.e. position -1, -1), glfwGetJoystickAxes returns 0 for both axes instead. All other values are unaffected (e.g. -1, -0.9). Other axes remain unaffected (left and right triggers are completely unaffected, and if the left thumbstick should read (-1, -1), then only it's axes will read (0, 0) while the right thumbstick returns the correct values and vice versa).\r\n\r\nThe issue was reproducible for me via test/joysticks.c.
