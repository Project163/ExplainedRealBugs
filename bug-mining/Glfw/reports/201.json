requested in [GLFW forum](http://discourse.glfw.org/t/positive-gamepad-axis-directions/956/11)...\r\n\r\n> But now that you asked for tests... In the [Joysticks Test](https://github.com/glfw/glfw/blob/master/tests/joysticks.c) the positive value of Y axis is **inverted** compared to DS4 and DS3 on **Windows** (8 and 10 at least). On linux it's ok ( all of the 4 models positive when down). The curious thing is that in [Gamepad HTML5 Test](http://html5gamepad.com/) the Y axis of Xbox gamepads is positive when down. In the Settings of Xbox gamepad on windows it's not inverted too.\r\n\r\n@elmindreda, I don't know if I'm right or this will fix all cases (or ruin everything :/) but reading the [MSDN spec](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/microsoft.directx_sdk.reference.xinput_gamepad(v=vs.85).aspx)...\r\n\r\n> **sThumbLX**\r\n> Left thumbstick x-axis value. Each of the thumbstick axis members is a signed value between -32768 and 32767 describing the position of the thumbstick. A value of 0 is centered. Negative values signify down or to the left. **Positive values signify up or to the right**. The constants XINPUT_GAMEPAD_LEFT_THUMB_DEADZONE or XINPUT_GAMEPAD_RIGHT_THUMB_DEADZONE can be used as a positive and negative value to filter a thumbstick input.\r\n\r\nA possible solution could be a minus signal [here](https://github.com/glfw/glfw/blob/master/src/win32_joystick.c#L714).\r\n\r\nWhat do you think?\r\nThanks!","closed_by":{"login":"elmindreda","id":133714,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMzcxNA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/133714?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda","html_url":"https://github.com/elmindreda","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/glfw/glfw/issues/1083/reactions","total_count":3,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":1,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/glfw/glfw/issues/1083/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
