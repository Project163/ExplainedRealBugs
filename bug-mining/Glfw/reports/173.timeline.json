You can also see that each phantom keypress has an old timestamp exactly identical to that of a keypress that was already received and processed, validating that HACK comment.\r\n\r\nMy guess is ibus doesn't send the keypress until the previous event is actually removed from the queue/forwarded/whatever, so it takes N processing loops to clear N keypress repeats. When FPS > key repeat rate, there is no issue, but otherwise they pile up and it takes many event loops to clear the backlog.\r\n\r\nThe solution is rather simple. Rather than filtering based on the last received timestamp, instead discard any events *older* by more than say 10ms than the most recent key event received, to account for noisy timestamps. The current code assumes the duplicate keypresses are adjacent in the event stream, which is false at low FPS. I'll make a PR soonish.","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/glfw/glfw/issues/comments/266182488/reactions","total_count":4,"+1":3,"-1":0,"laugh":1,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"jrkoenig","id":5673368,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NzMzNjg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5673368?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrkoenig","html_url":"https://github.com/jrkoenig","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrkoenig/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrkoenig/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrkoenig/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrkoenig/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrkoenig/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrkoenig/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrkoenig/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrkoenig/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrkoenig/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":889424083,"node_id":"MDE1Ok1pbGVzdG9uZWRFdmVudDg4OTQyNDA4Mw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/glfw/glfw/issues/events/889424083","actor":{"login":"elmindreda","id":133714,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMzcxNA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/133714?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda","html_url":"https://github.com/elmindreda","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"milestoned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2016-12-10T22:00:42Z","milestone":{"title":"3.3"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/glfw/glfw/issues/comments/266253732","html_url":"https://github.com/glfw/glfw/issues/747#issuecomment-266253732","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/glfw/glfw/issues/747","id":266253732,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2NjI1MzczMg==","user":{"login":"elmindreda","id":133714,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMzcxNA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/133714?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda","html_url":"https://github.com/elmindreda","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-12-11T01:08:01Z","updated_at":"2016-12-11T01:08:27Z","body":"@jrkoenig Thank you!

The output of a program then looks like this:\r\n```\r\nv\r\n^\r\nv\r\n^\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, that was a single long key press.\r\n\r\nThis issue is not present when working with GLFW in C, I've tested it.\r\n\r\nAlso, I have a locked main thread and so on, so the problem's not there.
