consider the following observations, which seem to apply to version 3.3.2 (latest release version) but do not apply on latest master commit (bb1d917c2fc0db03debf77c711fc37bef5231c88):\r\n\r\n1. `glfwInit` is a part of GLFW public API. Its [documentation](https://www.glfw.org/docs/latest/group__init.html#ga317aac130a235ab08c6db0834907d85e) says that the possible errors include `GLFW_PLATFORM_ERROR`. It does not say that `GLFW_INVALID_VALUE` is a possible error.\r\n\r\n2. `glfwInit` calls `_glfwPlatformInit`, which in turn calls `_glfwInitJoysticksLinux`, which in turn calls `openJoystickDevice`, which in turn calls `_glfwAllocJoystick`, which in turn calls `findValidMapping`.\r\n\r\n3. `findValidMapping`,  a part of GLFW internal API, calls `_glfwInputError(GLFW_INVALID_VALUE, \"Invalid button in gamepad mapping %s (%s), ...)` when it finds an invalid element for a joystick.\r\n\r\nBased on my current understanding, this seems unexpected given the documentation. Is there a bug, either in the documentation, or the implementation?\r\n\r\nIt seems this can trigger when running `glfwInit` with an Xbox One Wireless Controller plugged in. I can't reproduce this myself, this is based only on analyzing an issue report at https://github.com/libretro/ludo/issues/342 and https://github.com/go-gl/glfw/issues/292 and reading the code.\r\n\r\nThe Go wrapper `github.com/go-gl/glfw/v3.3/glfw` [accepts](https://github.com/go-gl/glfw/blob/5321531c36a27bf07a44ce335c3fc26b284183c3/v3.3/glfw/glfw.go#L36-L37) only `GLFW_API_UNAVAILABLE`¹ and `GLFW_PLATFORM_ERROR` error categories from `glfwInit`, and panics on any other error category. So it panics when it sees `GLFW_INVALID_VALUE`, leading to issue https://github.com/go-gl/glfw/issues/292.\r\n\r\nI'm reporting this here to understand if this is a problem in GLFW 3.3.2 or if it's a problem in how the go-gl GLFW bindings use it. It's possible this is already resolved on master thanks to deferred joystick initialization (commit 782e6b6cefc9ac2a2b6779f9e658ab948809253b, issue #1646). Issues https://github.com/go-gl/glfw/issues/127 and https://github.com/glfw/glfw/issues/833 may also be related. Thank you.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n¹ I'm not sure why `GLFW_API_UNAVAILABLE` is accepted despite not being documented, but I guess it's outside the scope of this issue. Edit: After looking into git blame history, I think the answer is related to https://github.com/go-gl/glfw/issues/118#issuecomment-70607912.","closed_by":{"login":"elmindreda","id":133714,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMzcxNA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/133714?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda","html_url":"https://github.com/elmindreda","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/glfw/glfw/issues/1763/reactions","total_count":5,"+1":5,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/glfw/glfw/issues/1763/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
