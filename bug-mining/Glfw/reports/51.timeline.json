@bornskilled200 and @elmindreda for the info with auto iconify.\nThat did solve the issue.\nHowever, once the window loses the focus because of me clicking on another monitor, the Windows Task Bar now gets visible over the GLFW window.\nThat might be expected behaviour (as it also happens with for example fullscreen YouTube videos on Chrome/HTML5), but is there a way to avoid this?\n","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/glfw/glfw/issues/comments/75255471/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"httpdigest","id":7488613,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc0ODg2MTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7488613?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/httpdigest","html_url":"https://github.com/httpdigest","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/httpdigest/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/httpdigest/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/httpdigest/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/httpdigest/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/httpdigest/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/httpdigest/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/httpdigest/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/httpdigest/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/httpdigest/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":239183579,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MjM5MTgzNTc5","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/glfw/glfw/issues/events/239183579","actor":{"login":"bornskilled200","id":2602658,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MDI2NTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2602658?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bornskilled200","html_url":"https://github.com/bornskilled200","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bornskilled200/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bornskilled200/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bornskilled200/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bornskilled200/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bornskilled200/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bornskilled200/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bornskilled200/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bornskilled200/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bornskilled200/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2015-02-20T15:25:11Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":239183580,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDIzOTE4MzU4MA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/glfw/glfw/issues/events/239183580","actor":{"login":"bornskilled200","id":2602658,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MDI2NTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2602658?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bornskilled200","html_url":"https://github.com/bornskilled200","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bornskilled200/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bornskilled200/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bornskilled200/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bornskilled200/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bornskilled200/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bornskilled200/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bornskilled200/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bornskilled200/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bornskilled200/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2015-02-20T15:25:11Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":239183581,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MjM5MTgzNTgx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/glfw/glfw/issues/events/239183581","actor":{"login":"elmindreda","id":133714,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMzcxNA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/133714?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda","html_url":"https://github.com/elmindreda","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2015-02-20T15:25:11Z","performed_

your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**\r\nIn a multi-monitor setup (OS: Windows 10 21H2), ImPlay's windowed full screen minimizes when mouse is clicked on another monitor. This behavior is a bit inconvenient and different from MPV's.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nAccording to [https://github.com/glfw/glfw/issues/447](https://github.com/glfw/glfw/issues/447), fullscreen can remain maximized when it loses focus by setting the Window Attribute `glfwWindowHint(GLFW_AUTO_ICONIFY, GL_FALSE)`\r\nThe attribute conflicts with the `ontop` function at windowed mode, so it should only be enabled for fullscreen.\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\nI attempted implementing a fix https://github.com/TauZolver/ImPlay/commit/a970575da09ab03e59b0bafc592b82fa5a5f5e15 that works for my Windows PC, but I do not have machines to test if works for MacOS and Linux platforms.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nThanks for the amazing work! ImPlay gives motivation for one to want to drop PotPlayer for good.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tsl0922/ImPlay/issues/52/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tsl0922/ImPlay/issues/52/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
