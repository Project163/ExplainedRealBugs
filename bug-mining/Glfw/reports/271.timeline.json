It looks like this is a regression starting with 3.2.2. When I use version 3.2.1, the problem isn't there. Also, the problem isn't there on Windows with the latest LWJGL version.\r\n\r\n[Example that shows the problem](https://gist.github.com/marshallsa/eaa57786ebccede81cde5ebd380022b6) based on the SimpleDrawElements demo from lwjgl3-demos.\r\n\r\nWhen I run this example on 3.2.2 or newer, the screen tearing starts after a few seconds (before this, the animation is slow but doesn't tear). The screen tearing is only there when the window is near the bottom of the screen.\r\n\r\nUsing 3.2.1, the animation is always fast and smooth (no screen tearing).\r\n\r\n<!-- \r\n    and then describe the issue with as much detail as possible and clear steps\r\n    to reproduce.

I cloned glfw and compiled at the _3.3_ tag to run the \"Tests/tearing\" application, and it shows extreme tearing too around the bottom.\r\nThe tearing actually gets wors as the swap_interval increases. Very surprisingly, there does not seem to be any tearing when the swap_interval is 0 (which should disable VSync, so it is strange). But as soon as the interval is set to 1 or more, the tearing becomes extremely noticeable.\r\n\r\nIs there any progress on that front?","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/glfw/glfw/issues/comments/537016583/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"Adnn","id":3911163,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5MTExNjM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3911163?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Adnn","html_url":"https://github.com/Adnn","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Adnn/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Adnn/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Adnn/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Adnn/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Adnn/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Adnn/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Adnn/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Adnn/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Adnn/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":2789436267,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDI3ODk0MzYyNjc=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/glfw/glfw/issues/events/2789436267","actor":{"login":"elmindreda","id":133714,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMzcxNA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/133714?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda","html_url":"https://github.com/elmindreda","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"19c0307dcbb1f345fce0f8d5251e81310a6f798f","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/glfw/glfw/commits/19c0307dcbb1f345fce0f8d5251e81310a6f798f","created_at":"2019-11-11T21:50:26Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/glfw/glfw/issues/comments/553181619","html_url":"https://github.com/glfw/glfw/issues/1483#issuecomment-553181619","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/glfw/glfw/issues/1483","id":553181619,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU1MzE4MTYxOQ==","user":{"login":"Spasi","id":1545420,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1NDU0MjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1545420?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Spasi","html_url":"https://github.com/Spasi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Spasi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Spasi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Spasi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Spasi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Spasi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Spasi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Spasi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Spasi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Spasi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-11-13T00:31:26Z","updated_at":"2019-11-13T00:31:26Z","body":"@elmindreda LWJGL users have been suffering from tearing since the move to CVDisplayLink and there's finally been a breakthrough that you may find interesting.

#2249, #1834.\r\n\r\nSomewhere along the line, Apple broke NSOpenGLCPSwapInterval. I've been researching this for the past week or so from various sources, and I decided to go ahead with using CVDisplayLink instead of NSOpenGLCPSwapInterval. SDL ended up doing the same thing (see issue thread [here](https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL/issues/4918)).\r\n\r\nI fixed it in my fork, and I decided to make this PR back to upstream for discussion on whether GLFW wants to go down this route as well.\r\n\r\nThe approach is very similar to SDL; pause the main thread right before swapping buffers in NSGL (in `glfwSwapBuffers`), and wait for the CVDisplayLink callback to continue. `glfwSwapInterval` is respected by waiting that many callbacks.\r\n\r\nBecause `cocoa_platform.h` uses a mutex, I had to shuffle around the includes in `internal.h` to get it included before `cocoa_platform.h`. I also had to add conditional variables to `posix_thread.h` and `win32_thread.h`. Multi-threading isn't my strong suite so I wouldn't be surprised if this can be improved further.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/glfw/glfw/issues/2277/reactions","total_count":3,"+1":3,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/glfw/glfw/issues/2277/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
