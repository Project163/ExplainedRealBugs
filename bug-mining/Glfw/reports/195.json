**MacOS 10.13 High Sierra**\r\nGLFW Version: **GLFW 3.3.0 Cocoa NSGL** @ 32e78ae\r\n\r\nYou can see this happening in the example `boing`.\r\n\r\n1) Run the `boing` test app, verify that the window title is `Boing (classic Amiga demo)`\r\n2) Press <kbd>alt-enter</kbd> to trigger fullscreen\r\n3) Press <kbd>alt-enter</kbd> again to exit fullscreen\r\n4) Window title is lost\r\n\r\nIn my own app I was just going to implement a quick fix by grabbing the current title before going fullscreen and setting it back when exiting, but then noticed that there wasn't a counterpart for getting the title as there is for setting it; i.e. there is a `glfwSetWindowTitle`, but there's not a `glfwGetWindowTitle` (which may be a separate issue in its own).","closed_by":{"login":"elmindreda","id":133714,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMzcxNA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/133714?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda","html_url":"https://github.com/elmindreda","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/glfw/glfw/issues/1082/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/glfw/glfw/issues/1082/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
