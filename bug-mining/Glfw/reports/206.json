the following minimal example, the resize callback get's called three times, I'd not expect it to be called at all since no resolution change is actually happen:\r\n\r\n```\r\n#include <GLFW/glfw3.h>\r\n\r\nstatic void windowSizeCallback(GLFWwindow * _window, int _width, int _height)\r\n{\r\n    printf(\"GLFW RESIZE %i %i\\n\", _width, _height);\r\n}\r\n\r\nint main(int _argc, const char * _args[])\r\n{\r\n    // initialize glfw\r\n    if (!glfwInit())\r\n        return EXIT_FAILURE;\r\n\r\n    // and set some hints to get the correct opengl versions/profiles\r\n    glfwWindowHint(GLFW_SAMPLES, 4);\r\n    glfwWindowHint(GLFW_CONTEXT_VERSION_MAJOR, 3);\r\n    glfwWindowHint(GLFW_CONTEXT_VERSION_MINOR, 3);\r\n    glfwWindowHint(GLFW_OPENGL_FORWARD_COMPAT, GL_TRUE);\r\n    glfwWindowHint(GLFW_OPENGL_PROFILE, GLFW_OPENGL_CORE_PROFILE);\r\n\r\n    //create the window\r\n    GLFWwindow * window = glfwCreateWindow(800, 600, \"GLAnnotateExample\", NULL, NULL);\r\n    if (window)\r\n    {\r\n        glfwSetWindowSizeCallback(window, &windowSizeCallback);\r\n        glfwSetWindowMonitor(window, glfwGetPrimaryMonitor(), 0, 0, 800, 600, GLFW_DONT_CARE);\r\n        glfwMakeContextCurrent(window);\r\n\r\n        // main loop\r\n        while (!glfwWindowShouldClose(window))\r\n        {\r\n            //...\r\n\r\n            glfwSwapBuffers(window);\r\n            glfwPollEvents();\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n    else\r\n    {\r\n        glfwTerminate();\r\n        printf(\"Could not open GLFW window :(\\n\");\r\n        return EXIT_FAILURE;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    // clean up glfw\r\n    glfwDestroyWindow(window);\r\n    glfwTerminate();\r\n\r\n    return EXIT_SUCCESS;\r\n}\r\n```\r\nI get the output where 1440 x 900 is the fullscreen resolution and 800x600 the one of the actual video mode that is finally picked:\r\n```\r\nGLFW RESIZE 800 600\r\nGLFW RESIZE 1440 900\r\nGLFW RESIZE 800 600\r\n```\r\n\r\nI am aware that this example is a little bit nonsense as of course I could initialize the window as fullscreen, but the same is happening if I go fullscreen to any other resolution, i.e. I get resize callbacks of the following logic when going fullscreen with a vidmode change:\r\n\r\n1. resize callback for original window size\r\n2. resize callback for current video mode\r\n3. resize callback for new video mode\r\n\r\nIn that scenario the expected behavior is only step 3 in my opinion. If you do heavy lifting whenever the window is resized, i.e. loading /resizing a bunch of assets, this is actually kind of annoying.\r\n\r\nLet me know what you think!\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\n**EDIT:** \r\nThis does not appear to be exclusively related to vidmode change, as if you go fullscreen without a vidmode change, you still get two instead of one resize callbacks a la:\r\n\r\n1. resize callback for original window size\r\n2. resize callback for fullscreen size\r\n\r\nI'd only expect step two in that scenario.\r\n\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"elmindreda","id":133714,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMzcxNA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/133714?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda","html_url":"https://github.com/elmindreda","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/glfw/glfw/issues/1085/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/glfw/glfw/issues/1085/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
