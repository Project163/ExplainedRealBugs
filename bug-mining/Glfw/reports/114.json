on OS X 10.10.4 for GLFW 3.1.1 and the latest in master:\n1. Hold down any (up to all) modifier keys\n2. Launch `tests/events`\n3. Release modifier key(s) after window is created and in focus\n\nResults:\n\n```\nxw@Lotus ~/glfw> ./tests/events\nLibrary initialized\nCreating windowed mode window 1 (640x480)\nMain loop starting\n00000000 to 1 at 0.145: Window focused\n00000001 to 1 at 0.680: Key 0x0154 Scancode 0x0038 (LEFT SHIFT) (with no mods) was pressed\n```\n\nI looked into the Cocoa logic (I haven't tried this on any other platform) and there's a few ways for it break:\n1. It looks like the modifiers are initialized to zero upon window creation and not to the user state.\n2. The modifier key logic detects changes over the entire `NSEvent modifierFlags` vector, not just the one corresponding to the relevant key in `NSEvent keyCode`. This makes it harder to fix the case of multiple simultaneous modifiers (e.g. CTRL+SHIFT) while the window opens.\n3. Left/right modifier handling is done by toggling the corresponding key's state when a `flagsChanged` comes in with no change in flags. This should instead be, \"with no change in flags and the corresponding `modifierFlags` bit set,\" since if the mod bit is clear it doesn't make sense to report a key pressed event.\n","closed_by":{"login":"elmindreda","id":133714,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMzcxNA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/133714?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda","html_url":"https://github.com/elmindreda","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/glfw/glfw/issues/566/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/glfw/glfw/issues/566/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
