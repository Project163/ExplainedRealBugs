run into [an issue](https://github.com/go-gl/glfw/issues/127) where we presumed that `GLFW_PLATFORM_ERROR` is a bug in GLFW / OS, as described by [the GLFW Error Code docs](http://www.glfw.org/docs/latest/group__errors.html):\n\n> A platform-specific error occurred that does not match any of the more specific categories.\n> \n> Analysis\n>    A bug in GLFW or the underlying operating system. Report the bug to our issue tracker.\n\nIn particular, we've received a `GLFW_PLATFORM_ERROR` due to a strange/non-existent joystick support on a Linux box:\n\n> Linux: Failed to watch for joystick connections in /dev/input: No space left on device\n\nMy question boils down to:\n- Should `GLFW_PLATFORM_ERROR` only be generated if there is a bug in GLFW or the OS?\n  - If so, this is a bug in GLFW / the OS.\n- Or does `GLFW_PLATFORM_ERROR` get generated in many more situations (such as a user's invalid system-configuration)?\n  - If so, the GLFW docs should probably be updated to reflect this stance more clearly.\n","closed_by":{"login":"elmindreda","id":133714,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMzcxNA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/133714?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda","html_url":"https://github.com/elmindreda","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/glfw/glfw/issues/450/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/glfw/glfw/issues/450/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
