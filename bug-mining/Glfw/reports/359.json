Support for Visual Studio 2012 and earlier will be removed soon.  This will allow all of GLFW to use some C99 features.\r\n\r\nGLFW currently maintains support for VS 2010 and later, with unofficial, unmaintained support for VS 2008.  This means that currently all code that needs to be compiled for Windows has to use what is essentially C89.\r\n\r\nCMake dropped support for VS 2010 [a while back](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/release/3.25.html#id15).  VS 2012 has been out of support for [nearly a year](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/lifecycle/products/visual-studio-2012) now.  Removing support for VS 2012 and earlier will allow us to use the [subset of C99](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cppblog/c1114-stl-features-fixes-and-breaking-changes-in-vs-2013/) supported by VS 2013 throughout the project.  This will be a significant quality of life improvement.","closed_by":{"login":"elmindreda","id":133714,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMzcxNA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/133714?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda","html_url":"https://github.com/elmindreda","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/glfw/glfw/issues/2465/reactions","total_count":10,"+1":8,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":2,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/glfw/glfw/issues/2465/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
