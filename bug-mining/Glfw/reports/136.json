following minimal program below, with the specified setup, results in the later shown error message.\n\n``` C\n#include <GLFW/glfw3.h>\nint main() {\n    glfwInit();\n    GLFWwindow* handle = glfwCreateWindow(1280, 720, \"bug?\",\n                                          NULL, NULL);\n    glfwDestroyWindow(handle);\n    glfwTerminate();\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n- **Library version:** `glfw3 3.2-4` (community/glfw-x11) on `gcc 6.1.1-2` (core/gcc)\n- **Library version string:** `GLFW version 3.2.0 X11 GLX EGL clock_gettime /dev/js Xf86vm shared`\n- **Operating system:**  `Linux 4.6.2-1-ARCH #1 SMP PREEMPT x86_64 GNU/Linux (Arch Linux)`\n- **Window manager:** `dwm 6.1-3` (community/dwm) on `xorg-server 1.18.3-2` (extra/xorg-server)\n\n```\nX Error of failed request:  BadMatch (invalid parameter attributes)\n  Major opcode of failed request:  42 (X_SetInputFocus)\n  Serial number of failed request:  132\n  Current serial number in output stream:  134\n```\n\nSeems similar to what was reported in SFML 2.3, recently: https://github.com/SFML/SFML/issues/991\nAnd also SDL2, some time ago: https://bugzilla.libsdl.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2997\nIt seems to be regarding the unique behaviour of some non-reparenting WMs.\n\nBoth GLFW and SFML seemed to start reporting this same issue on my setup a couple of weeks ago after a system upgrade, I have reproduced this on my other machine which also runs a similar setup. Lastly, I would like to thank for the amazing library, besides this issue, it has been working flawlessly!\n","closed_by":{"login":"elmindreda","id":133714,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMzcxNA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/133714?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda","html_url":"https://github.com/elmindreda","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/glfw/glfw/issues/789/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/glfw/glfw/issues/789/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
