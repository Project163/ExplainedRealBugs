One is that `MOUSE_VIRTUAL_DESKTOP` is weird, but that's not all.  I've implemented the same thing from the DirectXTK commit (Pokechu22@92380fa), but that doesn't actually work right.  The cursor moves fine for a bit, but when it gets to the edge of the monitor, it stops.\r\n\r\nIt seems that `SetCursorPos` doesn't work right when the cursor is hidden via `SetCursor(NULL)`, so the re-centering logic isn't working.  I've verified that by adding another key to the cursor test (this is not in the previously linked commit):\r\n\r\n```C\r\n        case GLFW_KEY_M:\r\n        {\r\n            int width, height;\r\n            glfwGetWindowSize(window, &width, &height);\r\n            glfwSetCursorPos(window, width / 2, height / 2);\r\n            break;\r\n        }\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen the cursor is visible, it moves back to the center and moving it around starts from the center.  However, when it is hidden (_not_ disabled), the tracking lines move to the center but the actual cursor does not.  I suspect that this is a special behavior for the `NULL` cursor, and will try using an invisible custom cursor instead.","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/glfw/glfw/issues/comments/392214199/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"Pokechu22","id":8334194,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgzMzQxOTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8334194?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pokechu22","html_url":"https://github.com/Pokechu22","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pokechu22/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pokechu22/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pokechu22/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pokechu22/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pokechu22/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pokechu22/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pokechu22/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pokechu22/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pokechu22/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":1648347957,"node_id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDE2NDgzNDc5NTc=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/glfw/glfw/issues/events/1648347957","actor":{"login":"elmindreda","id":133714,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMzcxNA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/133714?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda","html_url":"https://github.com/elmindreda","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-05-27T19:06:13Z","label":{"name":"bug","color":"b60205"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":1648347958,"node_id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDE2NDgzNDc5NTg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/glfw/glfw/issues/events/1648347958","actor":{"login":"elmindreda","id":133714,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMzcxNA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/133714?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda","html_url":"https://github.com/elmindreda","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-05-27T19:06:13Z","label":{"name":"Windows","color":"0078d6"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":1649959072,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDE2NDk5NTkwNzI=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/glfw/glfw/issues/events/1649959072","actor":{"login":"Pokechu22","id":8334194,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgzMzQxOTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8334194?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pokechu22","html_url":"https://github.com/Pokechu22","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pokechu22/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pokechu22/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pokechu22/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pokechu22/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pokechu22/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pokechu22/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pokechu22/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pokechu22/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pokechu22/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"49914ab15bc40026628e1412df3b104676dccaff","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Pokechu22/glfw/com

The problem is not as extreme when I start from the middle of the screen, but the behavior is still erroneous there.","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/glfw/glfw/issues/comments/881901885/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"LiliumAtratum","id":44499681,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0NDk5Njgx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/44499681?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/LiliumAtratum","html_url":"https://github.com/LiliumAtratum","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LiliumAtratum/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LiliumAtratum/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LiliumAtratum/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LiliumAtratum/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LiliumAtratum/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LiliumAtratum/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LiliumAtratum/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LiliumAtratum/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LiliumAtratum/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/glfw/glfw/issues/comments/881934319","html_url":"https://github.com/glfw/glfw/issues/1276#issuecomment-881934319","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/glfw/glfw/issues/1276","id":881934319,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAJFXBc40kT_v","user":{"login":"Pokechu22","id":8334194,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgzMzQxOTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8334194?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pokechu22","html_url":"https://github.com/Pokechu22","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pokechu22/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pokechu22/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pokechu22/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pokechu22/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pokechu22/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pokechu22/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pokechu22/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pokechu22/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pokechu22/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-07-17T17:48:31Z","updated_at":"2021-07-17T17:48:31Z","body":"I haven't worked with RDP in several years.

have not tested this - this is just me doing a code review - but it seems that the raw mouse input in win32 seems off\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/floooh/sokol/blob/3ebd63e8d13e3d5d4809b5f3b91d31933ba37d5e/sokol_app.h#L7230\r\n\r\nThe variable raw_input_mousepos_valid is only ever set to true when gated behind an if check of itself?\r\n\r\nI suspect the code should do:\r\n\r\n```cpp\r\n  LONG new_x = raw_mouse_data->data.mouse.lLastX;\r\n  LONG new_y = raw_mouse_data->data.mouse.lLastY;\r\n\r\n  if (_sapp.win32.raw_input_mousepos_valid) {\r\n      _sapp.mouse.dx = (float) (new_x - _sapp.win32.raw_input_mousepos_x);\r\n      _sapp.mouse.dy = (float) (new_y - _sapp.win32.raw_input_mousepos_y);\r\n   }  // <----- End brace moved here\r\n  _sapp.win32.raw_input_mousepos_x = new_x;\r\n  _sapp.win32.raw_input_mousepos_y = new_y;\r\n  _sapp.win32.raw_input_mousepos_valid = true;\r\n```\r\n\r\nNot really a bug, but is there a reason when calling GetRawInputData() you pass in a huge buffer and then cast it? Rather than simply a local RAWINPUT that has the address taken of.\r\nThe doc linked in the comment https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/winuser/nf-winuser-getrawinputdata does state:\r\n\r\nGetRawInputData gets the raw input one [RAWINPUT](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/desktop/api/winuser/ns-winuser-rawinput) structure at a time. In contrast, [GetRawInputBuffer](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/desktop/api/winuser/nf-winuser-getrawinputbuffer) gets an array of RAWINPUT structures.\r\n\r\nPerhaps at one point you were calling GetRawInputBuffer()? \r\nI am not an expert in this area - just something I noticed.\r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/floooh/sokol/issues/806/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/floooh/sokol/issues/806/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"actor":{"login":"Hilderin","id":81109165,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxMTA5MTY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/81109165?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hilderin","html_url":"https://github.com/Hilderin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hilderin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hilderin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hilderin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hilderin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hilderin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hilderin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hilderin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hilderin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hilderin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-11-09T23:07:08Z","updated_at":"2023-11-09T23:07:08Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/glfw/glfw/issues/2427","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/glfw/glfw","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/glfw/glfw/issues/2427/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/glfw/glfw/issues/2427/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/glfw/glfw/issues/2427/events","html_url":"https://github.com/glfw/glfw/issues/2427","id":1977839229,"node_id":"I_kwDOAJFXBc514259","number":2427,"title":"Disabled

some experimentation the VM issue appears to be a different problem with a very similar effect. The main differences are that the solution #2431 doesn't fix the issue, and if the cursor is held stationary for a while after switching to disabled cursor it behaves as expected - so it's likely this is a separate issue potentially due to a delayed mouse message appearing to cause a large virtual position change (I will investigate this

Virtual Machines (tested on VMWare 18 with Windows 11 host and Windows 8, 10 clients) use the host to handle cursor motion, and this prevents `glfwSetCursorPos` from working correctly, which breaks the `GLFW_CURSOR_DISABLED` input mode.\r\n\r\n# Reproduction Steps\r\n\r\n0. Set up and build the `cursor` test.\r\n1. On a virtual machine start the `cursor` test.\r\n2. Press <kbd>T</kbd> to enable tracking of the cursor.\r\n3. Move the cursor around some.  Note that everything is fine.\r\n4. Whilst moving the cursor, Press <kbd>D</kbd> to switch to disabled cursor move.\r\n5. Move the cursor.  The tracking lines should disappear and the cursor's position in the logs will be said to be far off the screen.\r\n\r\nNote: If the cursor is not moving for a while when the disabled mode is activated the disabled mode works fine. So there may be a lag issue at work here.\r\n\r\n# Workarounds\r\n\r\nFor disabled cursor mode [use raw mouse Input](https://www.glfw.org/docs/3.3/input_guide.html#raw_mouse_motion), in my testing this was unaffected.\r\n\r\nTo get `glfwSetCursorPos` working disable host mouse handling, for example with VMWare:\r\n\r\n*In order for SetCursorPos() or Mouse_Event() to behave the way you would expect, you can disable the absolute mouse and host cursor offload, by adding the following to the VM's .vmx file and rebooting:*\r\n\r\n`vmmouse.present = FALSE`\r\n\r\n# Further

Summary\r\nThe \"Tutorial 2.2 - Camera\" Example produces very large mouse position values. After a view seconds the mouse position is {<129309770. 134478720>} and rising. Calculating the mouse offset (from the previous move event) gives different values depending on the mouse position on the screen, -738, -378 if the mouse is at the top left and 64768, 65120 at bottom right.\r\n\r\nUsing the glfw 3.4 release seems to result in the OFFSET being equal to the position of the cursor relative to the center of the window. But that means the IMouse.Position property does accumulate the offset resulting in large positive or negative numbers.\r\n\r\n# Steps to reproduce\r\n- Platform: Desktop Windows 10 22H2\r\n\r\n1. Connect to another windows machine with Remote Desktop\r\n2. Run the Camera Example on the remote machine\r\n3. Try to move the camera using the mouse\r\n4. Put a breakpoint in the OnMouseMove function and inspect the mouse position\r\n\r\n# Comments\r\nI have tested it with the main branch using the sample but the same problem occurs in my project using the silk.net 2.20.0 nuget.\r\n\r\nThis might be related;
