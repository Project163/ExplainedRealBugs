test app does not create any threads, everything is in response to messages on the main UI thread. \r\n\r\nI have a possible fix through. \r\n\r\nThe \r\n\r\n```\r\nstruct _GLFWlibraryNS\r\n{\r\n   ...\r\n   id   autoreleasePool;\r\n   ...\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nappears to be there to serve as the main NSAutoReleasePool when GLFW is running the main application loop. However, in a Cocoa app, you always use the main NSApplication loop, which already has an autorelease pool. \r\n\r\nI've performed a little experiment and added a \r\n\r\n```\r\nglfwUseNSApplicationEventLoop(bool)\r\n``` \r\n\r\nfunction to glfw3native.h, and this set a bool that I added to ```GLFWlibraryNS``` that tells glfw that the native event loop is used, and not use the ```GLFWlibraryNS::autoreleasePool``` pool. Basically, I surround the calls to ```[_glfw.ns.autoreleasePool drain] / alloc/init``` with an ```if (_glfw.ns.useNativeReleasePool)```. \r\n\r\nThis approach seems to work, and according to the XCode leak checker, all the objects do get freed correctly. \r\n\r\nIf you guys are OK with this approach for using GLFW with the native NSApplication event loop, I'd be happy to document / clean it up, add the example application, and submit it as a PR.
