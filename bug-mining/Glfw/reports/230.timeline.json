is common in China or any other countries and regions that needs an proxy software (v2ray, shadowsocks, etc.) for faster connection speed. These softwares typically sets **Windows IE Proxy Settings**, but not setting environment variables **HTTP(S)_PROXY**. \r\n\r\nI found out that when vcpkg starts an external application (like cmake), it builds an environment variable list. We can use this design to make life easier. Because it is annoying to manually set variables in CLI, or open Advanced Computer Settings and set environment variables there. When using vcpkg in Visual Studio, we even need to restart VS to make the proxy variables take effects. It is also not a good way to just leave HTTP(S)_PROXY in the Windows environment variables list, because it may cause unintended behaviour, and sometimes we do not want to use a proxy at all.\r\n\r\nAs mentioned in #48, vcpkg wants an coherence design about using proxy that only detects HTTPS_PROXY. Thats reasonable because many external applications vcpkg uses (cmake, etc..) detects HTTP(S)_PROXY. But why not make life easier? We can do better than that and still follow this design.\r\n\r\nBy reading IE Proxy Settings manually, and sets HTTP(S)_PROXY in the environment variable list building process, this will make all external applications happy.\r\n \r\n```cpp\r\nif (System::get_windows_ie_proxy_enabled())\r\n{\r\n    auto proxy = System::get_windows_ie_proxy_server();\r\n    if (proxy.has_value())\r\n    {\r\n        // Most HTTP proxy DOES proxy HTTPS requests.\r\n        env.emplace(\"HTTP_PROXY\", proxy.value().c_str());\r\n        env.emplace(\"HTTPS_PROXY\", proxy.value().c_str());\r\n\r\n        System::print2(\r\n            \"-- Automatically setting HTTP(S)_PROXY environment variables to \", proxy.value(), \"\\n\");\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n``` \r\nThen what's left is vcpkg itself. I found two places that use proxy.\r\n\r\n1. tls12-download.c\r\nThis small application also tried to detect HTTPS_PROXY, we can add these code to detect IE Proxy Settings either.\r\n```c\r\n// If HTTPS_PROXY not found, try use IE Proxy. This works on Windows 10 20H2, so there's no need to determine\r\n// the OS version >= 8.1.\r\nif (access_type == WINHTTP_ACCESS_TYPE_NO_PROXY)\r\n{\r\n    WINHTTP_CURRENT_USER_IE_PROXY_CONFIG ieProxy;\r\n    if (WinHttpGetIEProxyConfigForCurrentUser(&ieProxy) && ieProxy.lpszProxy != NULL)\r\n    {\r\n        WINHTTP_PROXY_INFO proxy;\r\n        proxy.dwAccessType = WINHTTP_ACCESS_TYPE_NAMED_PROXY;\r\n        proxy.lpszProxy = ieProxy.lpszProxy;\r\n        proxy.lpszProxyBypass = ieProxy.lpszProxyBypass;\r\n        WinHttpSetOption(session, WINHTTP_OPTION_PROXY, &proxy, sizeof(proxy));\r\n\r\n        write_message(std_out, L\" (using IE proxy: \");\r\n        write_message(std_out, proxy.lpszProxy);\r\n        write_message(std_out, L\")\");\r\n\r\n        GlobalFree(ieProxy.lpszProxy);\r\n        GlobalFree(ieProxy.lpszProxyBypass);\r\n        GlobalFree(ieProxy.lpszAutoConfigUrl);\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n2. vcpkg/base/downloads.cpp\r\nThis code uses deprecated API `IsWindows8Point1OrGreater` and `IsWindows7OrGreater` to determine whether to use IE Proxy Settings. This have two errors. \r\n- These two API always returns false on OS >=8.1 unless an manifest is provided. (#48) (See [this](https://github.com/glfw/glfw/issues/1294) and remark section in [this](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/versionhelpers/nf-versionhelpers-iswindows8point1orgreater))\r\n- IE Proxy Settings also works on my Windows 10 20H2 and I don't know why not using it.\r\n\r\nSo I make two changes to that file.\r\n- In line 92 I use `WINHTTP_ACCESS_TYPE_NO_PROXY` to prevent WPAD use. (#48)\r\n- In later I removed `IsWindows8Point1OrGreater` and `IsWindows7OrGreater`. Currently if there's no HTTPS_PROXY variable detected, it will detect IE Proxy Settings.\r\n\r\nI think these changes will make vcpkg much easier to use, and also keeps the vcpkg's design language.\r\n~~I have no idea why Checks failed at 'Create Diff' too.~~ Run 'format' target before

is related to multi DPI support.\r\n\r\nIsWindows8Point1OrGreater() will return false on win8.1 or win10 is no manifest file

[ImGui_ImplWin32_GetDpiScaleForMonitor()](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui/blob/838c16533d3a76b83f0ca73045010d463b73addf/backends/imgui_impl_win32.cpp) fails to provide monitor dependent scaling as the monitor handler is ignored for versions below 8.1, see\r\n```\r\nImGui_ImplWin32_GetDpiScaleForMonitor()\r\n{\r\n    // if not win8.1 or higher:\r\n    const HDC dc = ::GetDC(NULL); // <- this is not monitor specific\r\n    xdpi = ::GetDeviceCaps(dc, LOGPIXELSX);\r\n    ydpi = ::GetDeviceCaps(dc, LOGPIXELSY);\r\n}\r\n```\r\nThis issue has been debated and fixed here:\r\n#https://github.com/glfw/glfw/issues/1294\r\n\r\nMy fix is mostly based
