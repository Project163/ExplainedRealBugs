The raw_values array\nprovides the untransformed values as they were passed up from the driver.\nThis is useful for applications that need to provide their own acceleration code\n(e.g. games).\nFor example, the following bit shows the acceleration applied on each axis:\n\nvoid print_rawmotion(XIRawEvent *event)\n{\n    int i;\n    double *raw_valuator = event->raw_values,\n           *valuator = event->valuators.values;\n\n    for (i = 0; i < event->valuators.mask_len * 8; i++) {\n        if (XIMaskIsSet(event->valuators.mask, i)) {\n            printf(\"Acceleration on valuator %d: %f\\n\", \n                   i, *valuator - *raw_valuator);\n            valuator++;\n            raw_valuator++;\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/glfw/glfw/issues/comments/46005345/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"SephiRok","id":686553,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4NjU1Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/686553?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SephiRok","html_url":"https://github.com/SephiRok","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SephiRok/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SephiRok/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SephiRok/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SephiRok/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SephiRok/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SephiRok/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SephiRok/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SephiRok/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SephiRok/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/glfw/glfw/issues/comments/46446782","html_url":"https://github.com/glfw/glfw/issues/304#issuecomment-46446782","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/glfw/glfw/issues/304","id":46446782,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ2NDQ2Nzgy","user":{"login":"elmindreda","id":133714,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMzcxNA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/133714?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda","html_url":"https://github.com/elmindreda","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-06-18T14:58:02Z","updated_at":"2014-06-18T14:58:02Z","body":"Absolutely.
