Glad you agree with me!\r\n\r\nI'm reluctant to endorse that solution because there is such a long list of defines that appear in the wild, and it would need to be updated every time Khronos or a loader library adds or changes any of them.\r\n\r\nCase in point, your proposed patch would not have avoided my issue as the header I get from glad guards with the following defines:\r\n\r\n```\r\n#ifndef __glad_h_\r\n#define __glad_h_\r\n\r\n#ifdef __gl2_h_\r\n#error OpenGL ES 2 header already included, remove this include, glad already provides it\r\n#endif\r\n#define __gl2_h_\r\n\r\n#ifdef __gl3_h_\r\n#error OpenGL ES 3 header already included, remove this include, glad already provides it\r\n#endif\r\n#define __gl3_h_\r\n```\r\n\r\nnot the `__gles`-prefixed ones. That's probably a bug in glad (I'll file an issue), but it proves how brittle this solution can be.\r\n\r\nYou could maybe add `__glad_h_` to the list (it's probably at least as stable as Khronos' identifiers), but there are a lot of other loader libraries out there...\r\n\r\nIMHO the simplest fix right now would be to change the documentation to simply say that if using a loader library such as glad, the user *must* define `GLFW_INCLUDE_NONE` to guarantee no duplicate definitions.\r\n\r\nYou could do both, of course; I don't think there's any actual harm in guarding the most common identifiers.","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/glfw/glfw/issues/comments/634342140/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"tombsar","id":3090978,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwOTA5Nzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3090978?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tombsar","html_url":"https://github.com/tombsar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tombsar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tombsar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tombsar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tombsar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tombsar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tombsar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tombsar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tombsar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tombsar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":3375839846,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MzM3NTgzOTg0Ng==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/glfw/glfw/issues/events/3375839846","actor":{"login":"elmindreda","id":133714,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMzcxNA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/133714?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda","html_url":"https://github.com/elmindreda","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-05-26T23:58:25Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3375839848,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDMzNzU4Mzk4NDg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/glfw/glfw/issues/events/3375839848","actor":{"login":"elmindreda","id":133714,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMzcxNA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/133714?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda","html_url":"https://github.com/elmindreda","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-05-26T23:58:25Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"actor":{"login":"tombsar","id":3090978,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwOTA5Nzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3090978?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tombsar","html_url":"https://github.com/tombsar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tombsar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tombsar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tombsar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tombsar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tombsar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tombsar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tombsar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tombsar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tombsar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-05-27T00:43:37Z","updated_at":"2020-05-27T00:43:37Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Dav1dde/glad/issues/273","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Dav1dde/glad","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Dav1dde/glad/issues/273/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Dav1dde/glad/issues/273/comments","eve

the moment, GLAD guards against duplicate header inclusion using the following defines (in OpenGL ES mode; not sure if this is relevant to desktop contexts):\r\n```\r\n#ifdef __gl2_h_\r\n#error OpenGL

the `gles2_` prefix.
