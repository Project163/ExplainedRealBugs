I'm following up on a downstream bug report at https://github.com/go-gl/glfw/issues/389.\r\n\r\nIt seemingly uncovered that it's possible for the `glfwCreateWindow` function to report the `GLFW_NO_WINDOW_CONTEXT` error code. However, the docs of [`glfwCreateWindow`](https://www.glfw.org/docs/latest/group__window.html#ga3555a418df92ad53f917597fe2f64aeb) currently don't include `GLFW_NO_WINDOW_CONTEXT` as one of the possible errors.\r\n\r\nLooking at the code briefly (at latest head commit, b4c3ef9d0fdf46845f3e81e5d989dab06e71e6c1), there is indeed at least one path for that to happen (on any platform):\r\n\r\nglfwCreateWindow\r\n⤷\r\n_glfwIsValidContextConfig\r\n⤷\r\n_glfwInputError(GLFW_NO_WINDOW_CONTEXT, NULL)\r\n\r\nPerhaps the current implementation is working as intended and the bug is in the documentation, or vice versa.\r\n\r\nThanks.","closed_by":{"login":"elmindreda","id":133714,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMzcxNA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/133714?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda","html_url":"https://github.com/elmindreda","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/glfw/glfw/issues/2456/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/glfw/glfw/issues/2456/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
