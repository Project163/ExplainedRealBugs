re-submitting the command-tabbing fix.  The code for the presentation options is identical to what I submitted with PR #895, but I've returned to the original code that you had using nil for the sender id in the `orderFront` and `makeKeyAndOrderFront` calls.\r\n\r\nI've found it difficult to get good information about the sender id, but my impression from what I have come across is that the sender id is most commonly used when coordinating with the Interface Builder (IB), which is not the case here.  Since most of the Cocoa code that I've seen in the past came from Apple, which seems to use IB exclusively, I mistakenly thought that it was necessary to provide the window as the sender id.  However, it seems that nil is clearly appropriate in this case.\r\n\r\nI've also been having difficulty finding detailed information on presentation options, but here is Apple's documentation: https://developer.apple.com/reference/appkit/nsapplicationpresentationoptions?language=objc\r\n\r\nThe following presentation options are used in fullscreen mode (i.e., when there is a monitor attached to the window):\r\n```\r\n            NSApplicationPresentationHideDock\r\n            NSApplicationPresentationHideMenuBar\r\n            NSApplicationPresentationDisableProcessSwitching\r\n            NSApplicationPresentationDisableHideApplication\r\n```\r\nThere is a fullscreen option (`NSApplicationPresentationFullScreen`), which you would think should be ideal and even necessary for fullscreen support, but I did not include it because it caused buggy behavior (which was actually quite similar to the erroneous behavior that I reported in issue #848).  From the Googling that I did about the fullscreen option, it seems like other people are encountering buggy behavior with it as well.\r\n\r\nWhen there is no monitor attached to the window, the option `NSApplicationPresentationDefault` is set explicitly to return to normal behavior.\r\n\r\nThis change occurs in the following three functions and is bracketed in an if/else statement based on the presence of `window->monitor` and kept separate from the existing code:\r\n```\r\n            _glfwPlatformShowWindow\r\n            _glfwPlatformFocusWindow\r\n            _glfwPlatformSetWindowMonitor\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe only exception is in `_glfwPlatformShowWindow`, where `makeKeyAndOrderFront` is used instead of `orderFront` when the window is being shown in fullscreen mode.\r\n\r\nFinally, while this change addresses the issues I mentioned in #848, I'm not sure if these changes match GLFW's behavior on other platforms nor if it is always the ideal behavior to disable command-tabbing in fullscreen mode.  I don't recall anything descriptive about this in the documentation, so if you can provide me with feedback, I'll be glad to update the code and resubmit, if necessary.  Otherwise, I've tried to follow the contributing guidelines and added a line about this bugfix in README.me, which I hope is helpful.  Also, per our recent discussions, I hope the additional detailed information about how this code works is helpful.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/glfw/glfw/issues/926/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/glfw/glfw/issues/926/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":1000076005,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MTAwMDA3NjAwNQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/glfw/glfw/issues/events/1000076005","actor":{"login":"elmindreda","id":133714,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMzcxNA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/133714?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda","html_url":"https://github.com/elmindreda","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":"3d8aa53573d488e45fa4a9f8ac40a6893386db63","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/glfw/glfw/commits/3d8aa53573d488e45fa4a9f8ac40a6893386db63","created_at":"2017-03-15T00:29:35Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":1000076614,"node_id":"MDEzOkFzc2lnbmVkRXZlbnQxMDAwMDc2NjE0","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/glfw/glfw/issues/events/1000076614","actor":{"login":"elmindreda","id":133714,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMzcxNA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/133714?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda","html_url":"https://github.com/elmindreda","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"assigned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2017-03-15T00:30:21Z","assignee":{"login":"elmindreda","id":133714,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMzcxNA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/133714?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda","html_url":"https://github.com/elmindreda","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/glfw/glfw/issues/comments/286605351","html_url":"https://github.com/glfw/glfw/issues/848#issuecomment-286605351","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/glfw/glfw/issues/848","id":286605351,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI4NjYwNTM1MQ==","user":{"login":"elmindreda","id":133714,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMzcxNA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/133714?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda","html_url":"https://github.com/elmindreda","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/events{/privacy}","rece
