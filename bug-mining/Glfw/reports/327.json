for BSD (have seen it on FreeBSD, NetBSD and I think OpenBSD as well) seems to print a warning about the GLAPIENTRY macro being redefined.  I know that this is only a warning, but it would be great if this could be fixed/silenced so that we don't have to see it when compiling for those platforms. Compiling for Linux and Windows is free from warning in my testing.\r\n\r\n```\r\nIn file included from /go/pkg/mod/github.com/go-gl/glfw/v3.3/glfw@v0.0.0-20211024062804-40e447a793be/native_linbsd.go:10:\r\nIn file included from /go/pkg/mod/github.com/go-gl/glfw/v3.3/glfw@v0.0.0-20211024062804-40e447a793be/glfw/include/GLFW/glfw3native.h:114:\r\nIn file included from /freebsd/usr/local/include/GL/glx.h:32:\r\n/freebsd/usr/local/include/GL/gl.h:56:11: warning: 'GLAPIENTRY' macro redefined [-Wmacro-redefined]\r\n/go/pkg/mod/github.com/go-gl/glfw/v3.3/glfw@v0.0.0-20211024062804-40e447a793be/glfw/include/GLFW/glfw3.h:5894:10: note: previous definition is here\r\n```\r\n\r\nI think it is an issue here at least.
