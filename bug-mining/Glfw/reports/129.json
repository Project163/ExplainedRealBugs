creating a windowed (not full screen) ogl context on mac osX, with the cursor mode as GLFW_CURSOR_DISABLED, the cursor stays exactly where it was right before opening the windows, so if the windows doesn't overlay the cursor position, the cursor is still visible.\n\nWhen moving the event are sent to the glfw windows, but when I click the click is actually registered outside the glfw window (ie the window lost focus).\n\nWould it be possible that when setting the cursor to GLFW_CURSOR_DISABLED mode, itmoves to the center of the windows automatically to avoid this kind of issue ?\n","closed_by":{"login":"elmindreda","id":133714,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMzcxNA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/133714?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda","html_url":"https://github.com/elmindreda","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/glfw/glfw/issues/617/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/glfw/glfw/issues/617/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
