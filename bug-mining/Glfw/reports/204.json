for specifying a single alpha value for the whole window. Suggested hint and attribute name is `GLFW_OPACITY`. Implemented on Windows as `LWA_ALPHA`, on macOS as `NSWindow alphaValue` and on X11 as `_NET_WM_WINDOW_OPACITY`. Unlike framebuffer transparency this can be updated at any time after window creation.\r\n\r\nThis will require renaming `GLFW_TRANSPARENCY` to avoid confusion. Some possible new names are `GLFW_TRANSPARENT_FRAMEBUFFER` and `GLFW_OPACITY_FROM_FRAMEBUFFER`.","closed_by":{"login":"elmindreda","id":133714,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMzcxNA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/133714?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda","html_url":"https://github.com/elmindreda","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/glfw/glfw/issues/1089/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/glfw/glfw/issues/1089/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
