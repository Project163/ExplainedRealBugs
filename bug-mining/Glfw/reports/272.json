resizing a window from the left or top edge, or the top-left corner GLFW will:\r\n - On Windows trigger both ImGui_ImplGlfw_WindowSizeCallback() and ImGui_ImplGlfw_WindowPosCallback()\r\n- On Linux trigger only ImGui_ImplGlfw_WindowSizeCallback()\r\n\r\nOn Linux this can create problems for programs that assume any change in window origin location will be accompanied by a ImGui_ImplGlfw_WindowPosCallback(), since resizing from the top or left edge, or the top-left corner will change the origin location for the window. Maximizing a window will also change the origin location (not sure what callbacks this triggers).\r\n\r\nIt isn't clear to me which behavior is \"correct\", but it should be consistent across platforms. I am running GLFW master - built a few hours ago.","closed_by":{"login":"elmindreda","id":133714,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMzcxNA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/133714?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda","html_url":"https://github.com/elmindreda","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/glfw/glfw/issues/1613/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/glfw/glfw/issues/1613/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
