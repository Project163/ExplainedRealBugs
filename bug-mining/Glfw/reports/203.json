knows.\r\n\r\nWhat does the `uninstall` target do that is generated in Visual Studio when using this with CMAKE?\r\n\r\nHow do we disable it?\r\n\r\nIt is not mentioned in the documentation, nor any of the code within the \"install\" target CMakelists itself.\r\n\r\nIf it must exist can it be automatically added inside the `GLFW3` folder instead of outside it?","closed_by":{"login":"elmindreda","id":133714,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMzcxNA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/133714?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda","html_url":"https://github.com/elmindreda","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/glfw/glfw/issues/1129/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/glfw/glfw/issues/1129/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
