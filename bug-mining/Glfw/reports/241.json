currently working on a mod for the Minecraft game. One of the important changes I have made is the upgrade from lwjgl 2 to lwjgl 3 (which upgrade glwf). Everything is really great, there is even a visible performance gain!\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, even after 2 months some players still complain about the sensitivity of the mouse they find \"strange\".\r\nApparently the use of raw mouse input made the difference (https://github.com/glfw/glfw/commit/918b4e81d264a12ae5ad3c798ab34d9a2c53d2e3 / #125).\r\nI totally agree that this change is excellent and consistent! But after years of playing some players can't play without the windows cursor movement improvments.\r\n\r\nWould it be possible to add an option to force the use of WM_MOUSEMOVE instead of WM_INPUT?\r\nBy default, WM_INPUT would be used but the developer will be able to modify this behavior at runtime.\r\n\r\nIf I propose a pull request does it have a chance to be accepted?\r\n\r\nNote: Many game have an option to enable/disable the use of raw inputs (Rainbow6, CS:GO, ...).","closed_by":{"login":"elmindreda","id":133714,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMzcxNA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/133714?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda","html_url":"https://github.com/elmindreda","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/glfw/glfw/issues/1400/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/glfw/glfw/issues/1400/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
