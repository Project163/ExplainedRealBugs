there,\r\n\r\nI'm getting an error when building the library from source with Bazel using an external dependency rule. I believe that this problem is related to bazel defining DEBUG to be 1, which they claim is the [correct behavior ](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/3513) on MacOSX. The word DEBUG is used in at least one place in the code base and this creates problems. Here is the error:\r\n\r\n```\r\n/var/tmp/_bazel_grantreszczyk/0c7662858b5d6ee977c0c3f6d357e89a/sandbox/darwin-sandbox/12/execroot/__main__/external/glfw_src/tests/glfwinfo.c:361:39: error: expected identifier\r\n    enum { CLIENT, CONTEXT, BEHAVIOR, DEBUG, FORWARD, HELP, EXTENSIONS, LAYERS,\r\n                                      ^\r\n<command line>:2:15: note: expanded from here\r\n#define DEBUG 1\r\n              ^\r\n/var/tmp/_bazel_grantreszczyk/0c7662858b5d6ee977c0c3f6d357e89a/sandbox/darwin-sandbox/12/execroot/__main__/external/glfw_src/tests/glfwinfo.c:463:18: error: duplicate case value: 'CONTEXT' and '1' both equal '1'\r\n            case DEBUG:\r\n                 ^\r\n<command line>:2:15: note: expanded from here\r\n#define DEBUG 1\r\n              ^\r\n/var/tmp/_bazel_grantreszczyk/0c7662858b5d6ee977c0c3f6d357e89a/sandbox/darwin-sandbox/12/execroot/__main__/external/glfw_src/tests/glfwinfo.c:449:18: note: previous case defined here\r\n            case CONTEXT:\r\n                 ^\r\n2 errors generated.\r\nmake[2]: *** [tests/CMakeFiles/glfwinfo.dir/glfwinfo.c.o] Error 1\r\nmake[1]: *** [tests/CMakeFiles/glfwinfo.dir/all] Error 2\r\nmake: *** [all] Error 2\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen I compile with optimization flags, the library builds as expected.
