I discovered [a bug](https://github.com/azul3d/gfx/issues/76) in my code using GLFW which produces an error like:\n\n```\nWGL: Failed to enable sharing with specified OpenGL context\n```\n\nAfter a long day of tracking the issue down, I managed to find the cause. In short: when creating a window **you may not specify a shared context that is _currently active in any thread_**.\n\nThis seems to be just a WGL restriction (not a restriction with GLX). In reality, this restriction is okay and there's no way to work around it regardless.\n\nI propose having the docs for glfwCreateWindow mention this restriction, for others whom might run into this issue.\n","closed_by":{"login":"elmindreda","id":133714,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMzcxNA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/133714?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda","html_url":"https://github.com/elmindreda","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/glfw/glfw/issues/402/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/glfw/glfw/issues/402/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
