trying to run [kitty](github.com/kovidgoyal/kitty) as a native Wayland application, I ran into the following error: https://github.com/kovidgoyal/kitty/issues/157#issuecomment-389390996 , namely\r\n```\r\nwl_surface@13: error 3: xdg_surface must not have a buffer at creation\r\n[135 23:29:00.699834] [glfw error 65544]: Wayland: Focusing a window requires user interaction\r\n[135 23:29:00.699870] [glfw error 65544]: Wayland: Window position retrieval not supported\r\n```\r\nIt seems that kitty and perhaps other apps using glfw for rendering allow the creation of a surface which already has a buffer attached, which is not allowed. For example, the sway window manager throws an error when launching kitty (https://github.com/swaywm/sway/issues/1992). Although kitty uses a patched version of glfw, the changes only pertain to some keyboard handling and I don't believe that is the source of the issue. I would appreciate any help - this is far from my area of expertise, so let me know if there is any other information I can provide that would be useful.\r\n\r\nThank you!","closed_by":{"login":"elmindreda","id":133714,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMzcxNA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/133714?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda","html_url":"https://github.com/elmindreda","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/glfw/glfw/issues/1268/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/glfw/glfw/issues/1268/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
