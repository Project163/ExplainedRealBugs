current GLFW monitors api, at least on Windows and OSX really identifies 'screens' rather than monitor (working from the terminology that a screen represents a virtual desktop area, while a monitor identifies a physical display device).  \n\nThis poses problems for developers attempting to target the Oculus Rift, particularly if they're using cloned displays, as the top level monitor only identifies itself by the name of \"Generic PnP Monitor\".  \n\nPotential solutions could involve changing the behavior to include both virtual screens and actual monitors, or providing a parallel API for physical devices in addition to the current API for screens.  Alternatively, providing an API to access the EDID information for each monitor might prove useful.  \n\nI'll look into the code and see if there's an easy way to adapt for the first approach, listing all monitors, active, inactive, cloned or otherwise.\n","closed_by":{"login":"elmindreda","id":133714,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMzcxNA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/133714?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda","html_url":"https://github.com/elmindreda","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/glfw/glfw/issues/212/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/glfw/glfw/issues/212/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
