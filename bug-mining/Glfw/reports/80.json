windows 7 with glfw 3.1.1\n\nWhile the cursor is DISABLED with glfwSetInputMode() all calls to glfwWaitEvents() return immediately. This does not happen when the cursor is set to NORMAL or HIDDEN.\n\nSince glfw can't wait for events while the cursor is disabled this can be demanding on threaded applications where the cursor is disabled most of the time e.g. for controlling a camera with the mouse.\n\nI used the code below to test this behavior when disabling the cursor the while loops at seemingly unrestrained frequency:\n\n```\n#include <stdio.h>\n#include <GLFW/glfw3.h>\n\nint main(int argc, char **argv)\n{\n    if( !glfwInit() ) { return -1; }\n    GLFWwindow* window = glfwCreateWindow( 500, 500, \"WaitForEvents\", NULL, NULL );\n    if( !window ) { glfwTerminate(); return -1; }\n    glfwMakeContextCurrent( window );\n\n    glfwSetInputMode( window, GLFW_CURSOR, GLFW_CURSOR_DISABLED );\n\n    int counter = 0;\n    while( !glfwWindowShouldClose( window ) )\n    {\n        printf( \"%i\\n\", ++counter );\n        glfwWaitEvents();\n    }\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\nAlso I noticed calling glfwSetCursorPos() some short time before glfwWaitEvents() will prevent waiting for events too. If this is expected how would I disable the mouse and efficiently wait for events?\n","closed_by":{"login":"elmindreda","id":133714,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMzcxNA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/133714?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda","html_url":"https://github.com/elmindreda","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/glfw/glfw/issues/543/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/glfw/glfw/issues/543/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
