Musbach (username on discourse DigitalEmotions) has [reported an issue with the size and framebuffersize callbacks on Windows](http://discourse.glfw.org/t/misleading-api-documentation/636).\n\nI've verified that this issue exists as described on my Windows 8.1 system.\n\nSpecifics:\n\nIf the monitor undergoes an orientation change from landscape to portrait or visa versa in Windows the **glfwSetWindowSizeCallback** and **glfwSetFramebufferSizeCallback** functions report the incorrect width and height, with the these being transposed. This causes any viewport change using the values provided to result in incorrect rendering. This can be confirmed by calling **glfwGetWindowSize()** in the callback which will return the correct result.\n\nFurther investigation shows that the WM_SIZE message posted is the root of the error, as it appears to be incorrect after an orientation change. According to msdn the WM_DISPLAYCHANGE message should provide the correct width and heigh, but it is simpler to alter the WM_SIZE to check the client area using either glfwGetFramebufferSize, glfwGetWindowSize. I have a fix with this in which I'll provide a pull request for.\n\n**Workaround** Use glfwGetFramebufferSize for viewport size setting. Note that this returns the same values  in Windows as glfwGetWindowSize.\n\n**OS:** Windows 7 (unknown specifics), Windows 8.1 64bit.\n","closed_by":{"login":"elmindreda","id":133714,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMzcxNA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/133714?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda","html_url":"https://github.com/elmindreda","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/glfw/glfw/issues/740/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/glfw/glfw/issues/740/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
