The GLFW implementation does so during the event loop, however the current implementation does not correctly handle the interaction with a window losing focus.\n\nThis has resulted in issue #2727 with a workaround fix in merged PR #2732 which ignores repeats when no window has focus. This could result in lost events and potentially an application with multiple GLFW windows receiving key repeat events to the wrong window. **EDIT: After further debugging #2741 shows why this occurs, however repeat key handling should still occur in the leave event**\n\nA full fix would require handling the repeat events when the window loses focus.","closed_by":{"login":"dougbinks","id":872946,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg3Mjk0Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/872946?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dougbinks","html_url":"https://github.com/dougbinks","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dougbinks/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dougbinks/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dougbinks/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dougbinks/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dougbinks/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dougbinks/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dougbinks/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dougbinks/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dougbinks/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/glfw/glfw/issues/2736/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/glfw/glfw/issues/2736/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
