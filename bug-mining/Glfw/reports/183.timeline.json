code implements joystick hat support per issue #889.\r\n\r\nThe API change is to add the following function (and #defines for each of the hat positions such as GLFW_HAT_RIGHT_UP):\r\n\r\n    GLFWAPI const unsigned char* glfwGetJoystickHats(int jid, int* count);\r\n\r\nThe events test (events.c) has been updated to reflect the number of hat switches when a joystick is connected.\r\n\r\nThe joystick test (joystick.c) has been updated to add a new row for hat switches that displays the position in human-readable text (e.g., \"right_up\").\r\n\r\nCode for macOS has been provided and tested.\r\n\r\nCode for Windows has been provided, but has not been compiled or tested since I do not have access to a Windows system.\r\n\r\nCode for Linux has also been provided, but relevant portions are compiled out with the #defines JSIOCGHATS and JS_EVENT_HAT -- following the JSIOCGAXES / JSIOCGBUTTONS and JS_EVENT_AXIS / JS_EVENT_BUTTON syntax, respectively -- since <linux/joystick.h> does not currently provide support for hat switches; if such support is added to <linux/joystick.h>, the code should work however.  This code also has not been compiled or tested since I do not have access to a Linux system.\r\n\r\nA remark about the lack of support for hat switches on Linux appears in the documentation for

handling of the joystick hat seems flawed.\n\nCurrently the 9 possible states are treated as distinct buttons, but this is problematic because the diagonal directions are detected as two buttons. For example, UP and UPLEFT cannot be distinguished simply via the API. The callback model proposed by #856 would pass through UPLEFT as two distinct button pushes for UP and LEFT. This may not be desirable.\n\nIf the caller is responsible for working out the hat state, then there isn't a simple way to distinguish between a joystick with a hat and a joystick without a hat when the button count matches. For example, a joystick with a primary and secondary trigger and a hat would show up as 6 buttons as would a joystick with a primary and secondary trigger and 4 extra buttons and no hat. I suppose the last four buttons could be tested with user input to determine this, but it seems drastic to ask the user for help when GLFW can figure it out already.\n\nAlso, the code for hat processing seems to indicate that multiple hats are possible.\nPerhaps retrieved using `const int *glfwGetJoystickHats(int joystick_id, int *count)`?\n\nSo is it possible for the hat to not be treated as extra buttons but as its own thing? For example, `int glfwGetJoystickHat(int joystick_id, int hat_id)` returning the direction where direction is 0 for the neutral (centered) position and 1, 2, 3, etc for each of the possible directions (clockwise). A reason to not use the `GLFW_PRESSED`/`GLFW_RELEASED` style would be that it is impossible for the hat to be in more than one direction.

Convert Linux joystick code to using the evdev API\r\n* Add support for hats on Linux\r\n\r\nI'd recently experimented with swapping over from SDL2 to glfw and ran into the fact that hats are currently unsupported on Linux. I found a few issues on here which seem to have came to the same conclusion as myself; there is no good way to support them without converting over to the evdev API. I've done this conversion, and added support for hats.\r\n\r\nAs a disclaimer, I have no prior experience with evdev, so please triple check this change.\r\n\r\nOne concern of mine is that I'm not at all honoring the `flat` member from `struct input_absinfo`. It seems while the `fuzz` member is honored by the kernel, `flat` is expected to be handled by userspace code. However, I don't really know how exactly it should be used.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/glfw/glfw/issues/1005/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/glfw/glfw/issues/1005/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"actor":{"login":"elmindreda","id":133714,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMzcxNA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/133714?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda","html_url":"https://github.com/elmindreda","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-06-21T09:35:27Z","updated_at":"2017-06-21T09:35:27Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/glfw/glfw/issues/1033","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/glfw/glfw","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/glfw/glfw/issues/1033/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/glfw/glfw/issues/1033/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/glfw/glfw/issues/1033/events","html_url":"https://github.com/glfw/glfw/issues/1033","id":236824598,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWUyMzY4MjQ1OTg=","number":1033,"title":"Mac

Great work! The API looks nice. :)\r\n\r\nI don't mind the way it's now, but maybe the constants could start with `GLFW_GAMEPAD_BUTTON_` and `GLFW_GAMEPAD_AXIS_` respectively to make it even more obvious that they belong to two different categories. \r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThis is probably really obvious, but I just want to restate why I think some kind of unique identifier for the controller (for example `\"$controllerName:$GUID\"`) is important. Given that the `GUID` differs, one could store and restore the controller configuration (e.g. `moveUp=GLFW_GAMEPAD_DPAD_UP, useItem=GLFW_GAMEPAD_A`) for each controller, even if they're both called \"Xbox controller\".

I think it depends on what other controllers are/will be supported.\r\n\r\n@shurcooL You can see the full list [here](https://github.com/gabomdq/SDL_GameControllerDB/blob/master/gamecontrollerdb.txt). Basically anything that maps at least semi-reasonably to an Xbox controller.\r\n\r\n> I don't mind the way it's now, but maybe the constants could start with `GLFW_GAMEPAD_BUTTON_` and `GLFW_GAMEPAD_AXIS_` respectively to make it even more obvious that they belong to two different categories.\r\n\r\n@CreamyCookie Yeah, I wrote it that way initially but `GLFW_GAMEPAD_BUTTON_RIGHT_BUMPER` got pretty long. Still considering it.\r\n\r\n> This is probably really obvious, but I just want to restate why I think some kind of unique identifier for the controller (for example `\"$controllerName:$GUID\"`) is important. Given that the `GUID` differs, one could store and restore the controller configuration (e.g. `moveUp=GLFW_GAMEPAD_DPAD_UP, useItem=GLFW_GAMEPAD_A`) for each controller, even if they're both called \"Xbox controller\". Each player would automatically be assigned their personal config, which is useful if players have different tastes for how to control their character (or vehicle).\r\n\r\nIf you're referring to a unique hardware serial number, that's not exposed via the existing APIs. The GUID mentioned above identifies the make and model. If you mean a way to identify the current connection then the GLFW joystick ID serves just as well.","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/glfw/glfw/issues/comments/311484747/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"elmindreda","id":133714,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMzcxNA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/133714?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda","html_url":"https://github.com/elmindreda","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":1141299061,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MTE0MTI5OTA2MQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/glfw/glfw/issues/events/1141299061","actor":{"login":"dmitshur","id":1924134,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5MjQxMzQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1924134?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmitshur","html_url":"https://github.com/dmitshur","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmitshur/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmitshur/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmitshur/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmitshur/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmitshur/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmitshur/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmitshur/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmitshur/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmitshur/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2017-06-27T21:03:25Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":1141299063,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDExNDEyOTkwNjM=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/glfw/glfw/issues/events/1141299063","actor":{"login":"dmitshur","id":1924134,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5MjQxMzQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1924134?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmitshur","html_url":"https://github.com/dmitshur","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmitshur/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmitshur/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmitshur/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmitshur/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmitshur/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmitshur/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmitshur/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmitshur/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmitshur/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2017-06-27T21:03:25Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":1141299065,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MTE0MTI5OTA2NQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/glfw/glfw/issues/events/1141299065","actor":{"login":"jgandert","id":3063858,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwNjM4NTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3063858?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgandert","html_url":"https://github.com/jgandert","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgandert/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgandert/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgandert/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgandert/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgandert/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgandert/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgandert/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgandert/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jgandert/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2017-06-27T21:03:25Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":1141299068,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDExNDEyOTkwNjg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/glfw/glfw/issues/events/11412990
