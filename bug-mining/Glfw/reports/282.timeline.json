the bug**\r\nBuilding a simple project with glfw and angle built from vcpkg fails to initialize an EGL context. The glfw error message is \"EGL: Library not found\". When I dug into the glfw source code it is trying to initialize the library through LoadLibraryA or dlopen depending on the platform. Recompiling glfw with an absolute path to libEGL.dll works and achieves expected behavior.\r\n\r\nI'm pretty sure that we could also add the correct path to the search path at runtime to fix this, but I couldn't find an exposed variable to indicate where it is installed. Since this would need to be different for every instance, I'm pretty sure this isn't right. I didn't test this though.\r\n\r\n**Environment**\r\n- OS: Windows 10.0.19041\r\n- Compiler: clang-9, cl 14.24.28314\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\nSteps to reproduce the behavior:\r\n1. ./vcpkg install glfw3 angle\r\n2. Compile and run the following simple program. Errors will be printed to console with glfw's error message. \r\n\r\ntest.cpp:\r\n```#define GLFW_INCLUDE_GLES3\r\n#include <GLFW/glfw3.h>\r\n#include <stdlib.h>\r\n#include <string>\r\n#include <iostream>\r\nusing namespace std;\r\nvoid glfwErrorCallback(int a, const char *b)\r\n{\r\n    cout << string(b);\r\n}\r\nint main()\r\n{\r\n    GLFWwindow *window;\r\n    if (!glfwInit())\r\n        return 1;\r\n    glfwSetErrorCallback(glfwErrorCallback);\r\n    glfwWindowHint(GLFW_CONTEXT_VERSION_MAJOR, 3);\r\n    glfwWindowHint(GLFW_CONTEXT_VERSION_MINOR, 0);\r\n    glfwWindowHint(GLFW_CLIENT_API, GLFW_OPENGL_ES_API);\r\n    glfwWindowHint(GLFW_CONTEXT_CREATION_API, GLFW_EGL_CONTEXT_API);\r\n    window = glfwCreateWindow(640, 480, \"Simple example\", NULL, NULL);\r\n    if (!window)\r\n    {\r\n        glfwTerminate();\r\n        return 1;\r\n    }\r\n    glfwDestroyWindow(window);\r\n    glfwTerminate();\r\n    return 0;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nCMakeLists.txt:\r\n```find_package(unofficial-angle CONFIG REQUIRED)\r\nfind_package(glfw3 CONFIG REQUIRED)\r\nadd_executable(test test.cpp)\r\ntarget_link_libraries(test PRIVATE unofficial::angle::libEGL unofficial::angle::libGLESv2 glfw)\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nThe program should reach the end and return 0.\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nglfw only supports changing these paths at compile time, so we need to either set the search path at runtime, copy the dll to a path it's already searching, or recompile glfw such that it also looks in the correct directory. \r\n\r\nChanging the search path could be done if we had the path to the vcpkg install dir available to cmake, but I can't find one when I enumerate all the variables in cmake or on allthedocs.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vcpkg/issues/9822/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vcpkg/issues/9822/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":3248983310,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDMyNDg5ODMzMTA=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/glfw/glfw/issues/events/3248983310","actor":{"login":"Kangz","id":472810,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3MjgxMA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/472810?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kangz","html_url":"https://github.com/Kangz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kangz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kangz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kangz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kangz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kangz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kangz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kangz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kangz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kangz/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"2a7a18df184e95e954c97614c0f5777b27d23713","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Kangz/glfw/commits/2a7a18df184e95e954c97614c0f5777b27d23713","created_at":"2020-04-19T12:11:09Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"actor":{"login":"Kangz","id":472810,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3MjgxMA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/472810?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kangz","html_url":"https://github.com/Kangz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kangz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kangz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kangz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kangz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kangz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kangz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kangz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kangz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kangz/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-04-19T12:11:11Z","updated_at":"2020-04-19T12:11:11Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/glfw/glfw/issues/1680","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/glfw/glfw","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/glfw/glfw/issues/1680/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/glfw/glfw/issues/1680/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/glfw/glfw/issues/1680/events","html_url":"https://github.com/glfw/glfw/pull/1680","id":602699488,"node_id":"MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0NDA1NjU0MTg2","number":1680,"title":"Use
