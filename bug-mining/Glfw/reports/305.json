working on ARM and there's very few options when it comes to how I can go around creating graphics there. Namely, I have to use EGL as context creation API and Opengl ES as the context.\r\n\r\nNow, I noticed some odd performance dips in my recent project, namely glfwSwapBuffers() takes a huge amount of time to render every X cycles. For example it would render 8 frames in 0.0003 seconds each, and then glfwSwapBuffers would take 0.4 seconds on the 9th iteration.\r\n\r\nOne of the suspects was double buffering, so I wanted to disable it. Alas, when I try to - it throws in an error \"EGL: Failed to find a suitable EGLConfig\"\r\n\r\nUpon digging through your code, I found the likely suspect in egl_context.c chooseEGLConfig, line 176\r\nBasically, as far as I understand, you retrieve the available buffers, but then instead of reading the doublebuffer value from EGL, like with all other parameters, you just go **u->doublebuffer = GLFW_TRUE;**\r\n\r\nmaybe I'm wrong and it's not the place, but you should look at it.","closed_by":{"login":"elmindreda","id":133714,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMzcxNA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/133714?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda","html_url":"https://github.com/elmindreda","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/glfw/glfw/issues/1843/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/glfw/glfw/issues/1843/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
