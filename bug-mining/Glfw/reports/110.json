Steam overlay on Linux is unresponsive to mouse motion events (it works correctly on Windows and OS X). It appears the cursor position is refreshed only if it comes together with a mouse click event.\n\nThe issue seems to be due to capturing XI_Motion events with XInput https://github.com/glfw/glfw/blob/master/src/x11_window.c#L350\n\n```\n    XISetMask(mask, XI_Motion);\n    XISelectEvents(_glfw.x11.display, window->x11.handle, &eventmask, 1);\n```\n\nThe X11 manual (http://www.x.org/archive/X11R7.5/doc/man/man3/XISelectEvents.3.html) says:\n\n```\n    XISelectEvents sets the event mask for this client on win.\n    Further events are only reported to this client if the event\n    type matches the selected event mask. The masks overrides the\n    previously selected event mask for the given device.\n```\n\nSDL seems to get around this by setting the mask for XI_RawMotion instead of XI_Motion (confirmed to work) https://hg.libsdl.org/SDL/file/b300e097899d/src/video/x11/SDL_x11xinput2.c#l120\n\n```\n    XISetMask(mask, XI_RawMotion);\n```\n","closed_by":{"login":"elmindreda","id":133714,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMzcxNA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/133714?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda","html_url":"https://github.com/elmindreda","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/glfw/glfw/issues/304/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/glfw/glfw/issues/304/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
