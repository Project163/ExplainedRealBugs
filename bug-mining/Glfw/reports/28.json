have two monitors, each 1920x1080, positioned one atop the other.  I also have a Rift device which has a native resolution of 1280x800, but which will accept input at 1920x1080 and scale it down to the physical display.  The top monitor display is cloned to the Rift, while the bottom monitor is set as my primary display.  \n\nIf I create a fullscreen window of 1920x1080 targeting the cloned Rift & top monitor, the resulting window renders correctly.  If I create a fullscreen window using the Rift's native resolution of 1280x800, the resulting output appears cropped... see image:\n\n![image](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/1533642/1898179/2274089e-7c11-11e3-8626-ce8288fb42c2.png)\n\nExperimenting, I discovered that something similar happens if I place the target monitor to the left of my other display....  \n\n![image](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/1533642/1898188/c4c9ae5a-7c11-11e3-94ed-ef08b4149c9e.png)\n\nIf I place the target monitor below or to the right of the other monitor, then the problem goes away, presumably because the desktop position of (0, 1080) and (1920,0)  respectively is correct for either resolution.\n\nInvestigating the code, I discovered that the window is created using a position culled from  _glfwPlatformGetMonitorPos (win32_window.c line 821) before the video mode is changed.  Therefore it's getting coordinates such as (-1920, 0) or (0, -1080), which aren't correct once the video mode is changed via _glfwSetVideoMode (line 953, same file).  \n","closed_by":{"login":"elmindreda","id":133714,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMzcxNA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/133714?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda","html_url":"https://github.com/elmindreda","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/glfw/glfw/issues/213/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/glfw/glfw/issues/213/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
