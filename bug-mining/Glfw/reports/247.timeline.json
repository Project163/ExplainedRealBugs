LWJGL 3 backend\r\n\r\nI just committed the first iteration of the new LWJGL 3 backend. Going forward, i hope this can largely replace the old LWJGL 2 backend, especially on Mac OS X where we have a lot of problems with LWJGL 2. The new backend is also prepared for multi-window environments, altough respective methods in `Lwjgl3Application` haven't been exposed yet.\r\n\r\nThe LWJGL 3 backend is structure the same way as the LWJGL 2 backend, including the main module in `backends/gdx-backend-lwjgl3` and a test module in `tests/gdx-tests-lwjgl3`. Everything is wired up with Maven and Eclipse projects so you can test things. I also wired it up with our Ant build, haven't tested that one at all.\r\n\r\nIt would be amazing if you guys could help test this. I already build snapshots for the new backend, and all the code is merged with master. You can easily switch out the LWJGL 2 backend for the LWJGL 3 backend in Gradle. In your `core` projects dependencies, change:\r\n\r\n```\r\ncompile \"com.badlogicgames.gdx:gdx-backend-lwjgl:$gdxVersion\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nto\r\n\r\n```\r\ncompile \"com.badlogicgames.gdx:gdx-backend-lwjgl3:$gdxVersion\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nMake sure `gdxVersion` is set to the latest snapshot version `1.7.3-SNAPSHOT`. In your desktop launcher, simply replace `LwjglApplicationConfiguration` and `LwjglApplication` with `Lwjgl3ApplicationConfiguration` and `Lwjgl3Application`. That's it.\r\n### Not implemented yet\r\n- [ ] Window refresh callback for nicer resize\r\n- [x] HDPI support. Works out of the box on mac os x, but need to scale mouse coords accordingly. They are reported in logical coords, whereas `Graphics` reports framebuffer size now.\r\n- [x] Screen mode change related functions in [Lwjgl3Graphics](https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/blob/master/backends/gdx-backend-lwjgl3/src/com/badlogic/gdx/backends/lwjgl3/Lwjgl3Graphics.java#L163). Just haven't gotten around implementing those. Note that when changing the screen mode (e.g. window -> fullscreen), GLFW returns a new window handle. `Lwjgl3Input` and `Lwjgl3Graphics` need to re-register all the GLFW callbacks in that case with the new window handle.\r\n- [x] Clipboard support without AWT on Mac OS X\r\n- [x] Fix fullscreen toggling. On Mac OS X, the first windowed -> fullscreen switch fails in weird ways, e.g. clearColor has an effect, but rendering doesn't. Subsequent fullscreen -> fullscreen switches work as intended (but those use `glfwSetWindowSize` instead of creating a new window). On Window (10) fullscreen switching doesn't work at all on HDPI monitors, need to test on normal monitors. [Bug for Windows](https://github.com/glfw/glfw/issues/676), [Bug for Mac OS X](https://github.com/glfw/glfw/issues/680). Should be resolved in GLFW, libGDX side does the proper thing.\r\n- [x] Custom cursors in `Lwjgl3Graphics`. Haven't checked how to do that yet.\r\n- [x] Application icon support. This needs to be covered via tools like [PackR](https://github.com/libgdx/packr)\r\n- [x] Platform-specific multi-window API (`Lwjgl3Application#newWindow(ApplicationListener, int width, int height)/newWindow(ApplicationListener, DisplayMode)`).\r\n- [x] Controller support. GLFW comes with its own controller API, should be simply to add that to the controllers extension. There's a [bug](https://github.com/glfw/glfw/issues/601) on Windows in GLFW, where all gamepads are reported by the same name. This makes mapping controller types impossible.\r\n- [x] OpenGL 3.0 support. We should only need to add that to `Lwjgl3Application#createGlfwWindow`. The `Lwjgl3GL30` implementation is prepared, except for `Lwjgl3GL30#glGetBufferPointerv`\r\n- [ ] Mac OS X (potentially Windows and Linux too): glfwSwapBuffers doesn't block in windowed mode if app window is fully behind other window or minimized. [Bug](https://github.com/glfw/glfw/issues/680) with GLFW. Could \"fix\" it in our own code.\r\n- [ ] [Lwjgl3Input#getTextInput()](https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/blob/master/backends/gdx-backend-lwjgl3/src/com/badlogic/gdx/backends/lwjgl3/Lwjgl3Input.java#L240), can't call into Swing/AWT\r\n- [x] Non-continuous rendering in `Lwjgl3Graphics`. It's a bit of a bitch. `Lwjgl3Input` will already call `Graphics#requestRendering()` in case new input events arrive\r\n- [ ] Make OpenALAudio thread-safe, put the update on a separate thread\r\n### Known Issues\r\n- LWJGL 3 is based on GLFW. GLFW and AWT don't play nice with each other. Calling Swing/AWT stuff is thus not possible at the moment.\r\n- On Mac OS X, you need to pass the JVM argument `-XstartOnFirstThread` when starting your app. We may be able to fix both things to some extend.\r\n- If you use the multi-window API, understand that any `Runnable` you post via `Gdx.app.postRunnable()` may be executed in such a way that the statics in `Gdx`, like `Gdx.graphics` may point to a window other than the one for which the runnable was posted.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/3673/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/libgdx/libgdx/issues/3673/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/glfw/glfw/issues/comments/168232926","html_url":"https://github.com/glfw/glfw/issues/680#issuecomment-168232926","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/glfw/glfw/issues/680","id":168232926,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE2ODIzMjkyNg==","user":{"login":"elmindreda","id":133714,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMzcxNA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/133714?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda","html_url":"https://github.com/elmindreda","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-12-31T18:31:16Z","updated_at":"2015-12-31T18:31:16Z","body":"That is by design, but it's Apple's design.

a window is not hidden but occluded, e.g. by another window or the\nwindow is on another screen/desktop that is currently not shown,\n_glfwPlatformWindowVisible() returns 1 although the window is physically\nnot visible. This commit fixes this issue by treating occluded windows\nas hidden, i.e. non visible.\nUsage example:\nWhen the render loop is limited by v-sync, glfwSwapBuffers() does not\nblock on OS X when AppNap is enabled and the window is occluded.\nTherefore the application starts to burn CPU cycles althoug nothing is\ndisplayed. With the fix in this commit the application could check if\nthe window is visible using glfwGetWindowAttrib(window, GLFW_VISIBLE)\nand if the window is hidden (or occluded) it could pause the render\nloop.\nThis is a workaround for issue

everyone,\r\n\r\nI'm using GLFW to create an OpenGL context on macOS (Sierra, 10.12.3) on my MacBook Pro for off-screen rendering and I use the rendering results for some other image processing.\r\nMy settings consider two running applications: one for rendering and one for processing.\r\nWhen the rendering application is considered by the OS in **background**, i.e. when _loses focus_ by, e.g., selecting any other running application, the frame rate drops to considerable low value.\r\nThe application typically runs between 5 and 15 FPS, but drops to 1 FPS when goes in background.\r\n\r\nI experience this issue with either `glfwWaitEvents` + `glfwPostEmptyEvent` and `glfwPollEvents` to process events, and with `GLFW_VISIBLE` set to either `GL_TRUE` and `GL_FALSE`.\r\n\r\nI fear that this is an OS-related behaviour for some energy-saving policy, but I wonder whether I can force the hand somehow or
