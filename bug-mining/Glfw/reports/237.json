the [event processing documentation states](http://www.glfw.org/docs/latest/input_guide.html#events) that:\r\n\r\n *Even when you have no windows, event polling needs to be done in order to receive monitor connection events*.\r\n\r\nHowever the code for both [glfwWaitEvents()](https://github.com/glfw/glfw/blob/master/src/window.c#L1075-L1083) and [glfwPostEmptyEvent()](https://github.com/glfw/glfw/blob/master/src/window.c#L1101-L1109) require a window present to work. This should likely either be documented or fixed. See [this thead on event loops without windows](http://discourse.glfw.org/t/single-event-loop-thread/1162/3) for reasoning behind why it might be preferable to handle this by making the event loop work without windows if this is possible on all platforms.\r\n\r\nThis appears to be related to issue #1281.\r\n\r\nI would be able to handle the windows implementation, but am not familiar enough with the other backend event processing (I know it's a bit of a minefield from experience) if a fix is desired.","closed_by":{"login":"elmindreda","id":133714,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMzcxNA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/133714?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda","html_url":"https://github.com/elmindreda","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmindreda/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/glfw/glfw/issues/1317/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/glfw/glfw/issues/1317/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
