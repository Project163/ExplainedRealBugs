+__BUILD_SHARED_LIBS__ determines whether GLFW is built as a static library or as
+a DLL / shared library / dynamic library.  This is disabled by default,

+@anchor GLFW_LIBRARY_TYPE
+__GLFW_LIBRARY_TYPE__ allows you to override @ref BUILD_SHARED_LIBS only for
+GLFW, without affecting other libraries in a larger project.  When set, the
+value of this option must be a valid CMake library type.  Set it to `STATIC` to
+build GLFW as a static library, `SHARED` to build it as a shared library
+/ dynamic library / DLL, or `OBJECT` to make GLFW a CMake object library.
