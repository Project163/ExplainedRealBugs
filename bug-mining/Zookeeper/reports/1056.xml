            <title>[ZOOKEEPER-2693] DOS attack on wchp/wchc four letter words (4lw)</title>
                <link>https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZOOKEEPER-2693</link>
                <project id="12310801" key="ZOOKEEPER">ZooKeeper</project>
                    <description>&lt;p&gt;The wchp/wchc four letter words can be exploited in a DOS attack on the ZK client port - typically 2181. The following POC attack was recently published on the web:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most straightforward way to block this attack is to not allow access to the client port to non-trusted clients - i.e. firewall the ZooKeeper service and only allow access to trusted applications using it for coordination.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

                            <comment id="15864970" author="phunt" created="Tue, 14 Feb 2017 03:35:45 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;A simple patch would provide a configuration option that disables these 4lw by default. We should include this in 3.4/3/5 code lines. Additionally in 3.5 Jetty metrics support was added, replacing the legacy 4lw. In 3.5.3 and later we should disable 4lw entirely (through a second config option) and encourage people to use Jetty instead.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="15865085" author="hanm" created="Tue, 14 Feb 2017 05:27:07 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;One option is to enable TLS for ZooKeeper client-server communication. Because TLS is on a different port (secureClientPort) than the four letter words port (clientPort), we can then put clientPort behind a firewall which effectively makes only admin (or whoever that&apos;s trusted) can execute four letter words.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This however does not address the issues completely, because TLS is only supported since ZooKeeper 3.5.1 so it would not work for 3.4.x. Also even with TLS presence, it might still be possible that a ZooKeeper ensemble is attacked as long as the ensemble is open to the world: we don&apos;t have rate limiting built in, so if a set of rogue clients making connection requests, when in large scale, could possibly keep ensemble too busy to serve other requests. Although we do have IP based authentication scheme we don&apos;t have any rate limiters implemented to enforce accesses in such case.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I believe the original design consideration for ZooKeeper was that ZooKeeper ensembles should only be accessible from a trusted computing environment instead of opening to the world. This design decision made perfect sense in the Hadoop context but might not be ideal given today&apos;s thread models (e.g., it is never safe to trust any network communication, attackers exist inside the corporate network, and so on.). As such, we may need to change the assumption on where ZooKeeper is going to be deployed and operated, but before that, to address this specific issue documented in the JIRA, we could do a combination of:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;As Patrick suggested, add configurations options to turn off four letter words and / or specific commands.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Document explicitly the recommended security practice on deploy and operate ZooKeeper - basically admin should not leave the ZK wide open to the world.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I think a patch contain both should be enough for resolving the current issue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In long term, we need reevaluate the design decisions and security thread models and to bridge the gap between the current design and what ZooKeeper is actually used in prod today (e.g. adding rate limiter, enforced access control, not just for TLS but also for Kerberos, like what &lt;a href=&quot;https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZOOKEEPER-1634&quot; title=&quot;A new feature proposal to ZooKeeper: authentication enforcement&quot; class=&quot;issue-link&quot; data-issue-key=&quot;ZOOKEEPER-1634&quot;&gt;&lt;del&gt;ZOOKEEPER-1634&lt;/del&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is trying to solve.).&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="15865958" author="phunt" created="Tue, 14 Feb 2017 15:28:23 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;I had another thought on how to handle this - rather than on/off we could limit the number of 4lw that would be allowed to run in parallel. For example we could allow only a single 4lw to run at any one time. This would still provide the ability to run a 4lw, but with protection against overuse. It seems like this should be fairly simple to implement. Additionally we could provide this as an option (e.g. some folks might want to allow 5 to run in parallel). Regardless if we take this approach I think we would still want the on/off switches I already detailed.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>

&lt;p&gt;    This is for master / branch-3.5:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Introduce a new configuration option that by default turn off 4lw.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Update docs that explicitly states ZooKeeper should not be deployed open to world for access and deprecating 4lw in favor of Jetty.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;p&gt;    With these combined, the attack described in &lt;a href=&quot;https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZOOKEEPER-2693&quot; title=&quot;DOS attack on wchp/wchc four letter words (4lw)&quot; class=&quot;issue-link&quot; data-issue-key=&quot;ZOOKEEPER-2693&quot;&gt;&lt;del&gt;ZOOKEEPER-2693&lt;/del&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is not possible if ZooKeeper is put behind a firewall where Jetty AdminServer is not publicly accessible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;    Note for tests: I did not add any unit tests to test 4lw disabling because it is fairly obvious (though I have to update a place to prevent existing test broken, because we are using 4lw extensively to query test server states. We could query AdminServer instead but I consider that&apos;s a future work item - and even if we use AdminServer exclusively we can&apos;t dump 4lw completely because AdminServer test depends on 4lw - chicken egg problem.). &lt;/p&gt;

                            <comment id="15867045" author="hanm" created="Wed, 15 Feb 2017 01:14:17 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/ViewProfile.jspa?name=phunt&quot; class=&quot;user-hover&quot; rel=&quot;phunt&quot;&gt;phunt&lt;/a&gt; I think what you are talking to is to add rate limiting to 4lw / admin server. There are various schemes and trade offs for rate limiter implementation, and I&apos;d prefer using a well tested one like the rate limiter from Guava if we are ok to pull in it as a dependency. &lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="15867074" author="phunt" created="Wed, 15 Feb 2017 01:31:46 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;Yes, effectively a rate limiter. However I was thinking in terms of number of 4lw that we would allow to run concurrently, vs number of operations per second. This would address outliers - possibly very long running 4lw. &quot;only let one 4lw run at a time, even it if takes 20 seconds&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Historically we&apos;ve limited our dependency on other components. Neither 3.4 nor 3.5 are pulling in guava today. One of the issues we&apos;ve heard from users is that (component versioning issues in particular) complicates deployment. I think adding new dependencies to something like 3.4.10, ostensibly a fix release, would be unwise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I threw the idea out there as a suggestion. We can take it or leave it for the various releases.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="15867079" author="phunt" created="Wed, 15 Feb 2017 01:45:49 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;I looked at the patch. It is reasonable, but I don&apos;t think we can go with an all/nothing approach, many users would still want to be able to monitor their system using existing 4lw based infra, while mitigating the attack, and this doesn&apos;t allow any middle ground. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How about on/off as you have in the current patch, but also allow a list of &quot;whitelisted&quot; 4lw - the default could be &quot;ruok&quot; and &quot;srvr&quot; or something of that nature. Notice we are building the list today here FourLetterCommands, and could build a list containing the configured whitelist instead? What do you think.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="15867227" author="hanm" created="Wed, 15 Feb 2017 04:30:51 +0000"  >&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I don&apos;t think we can go with an all/nothing approach, many users would still want to be able to monitor their system using existing 4lw based infra.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/ViewProfile.jspa?name=phunt&quot; class=&quot;user-hover&quot; rel=&quot;phunt&quot;&gt;phunt&lt;/a&gt; The current patch is for branch 3.5, where we have AdminServer, which is designed to replace four letter words. That is why the patch provides only an option to completely disable the entire four letter words instead of only disabling a specific subset. The AdminServer will make four letter words irrelevant and because AdminServer does not share the ZooKeeper client port (which sometimes have to be exposed publicly), admin of ensemble protected AdminServer port with firewall without interrupting ZooKeeper clients. Besides, this seems a good opportunity to push for deprecating four letter words in favor of AdminServer which is around for quite a while given the security concerns. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you think we still need provide a middle ground for 4lws for 3.5 release / master branch instead of completely shut it off? &lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="15867239" author="hanm" created="Wed, 15 Feb 2017 04:42:14 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;As for patch for branch-3.4, I am thinking instead of disabling a subset of commands, we could just add a rate limiter. All commands will still be available to use (including the wchp/wchc ones), but they are rate limited not to cause any damages. Disabling a sub set of commands does not solve the root issue, and I imagine it might still be possible to do DOS on servers acceptor threads by just utilizing white listed four letter words at massive scale on client side. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The configuration option of disabling 4lw or a subset of it seems an ultimate escape hatch - I guess it does not hurt to provide both as option for users, but for branch-3.4 it looks like rate limiter is a must have to address current and potential issues when the server client port is accessible from public.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="15867289" author="phunt" created="Wed, 15 Feb 2017 05:35:09 +0000"  >&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Do you think we still need provide a middle ground for 4lws for 3.5 release / master branch instead of completely shut it off?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&apos;s another way to think about this: we provide b/w compat when moving from X.Y.Z to X.Y+1.# As such we can deprecate 4lw in 3.5 (even turn it off by default), but we can&apos;t remove it entirely. If we want to provide a fix for this issue, and still maintain b/w compat in 3.5 then we should make it configurable. Does that make sense?&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="15867293" author="phunt" created="Wed, 15 Feb 2017 05:40:28 +0000"  >&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The configuration option of disabling 4lw or a subset of it seems an ultimate escape hatch&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;yes, this was my thought as well. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your argument around having the rate limiter makes sense, that&apos;s one of the things I was thinking about this morning when I originally recommended it. Now I&apos;m also leaning toward the &quot;whitelist&quot; approach because I think it&apos;s a very clean solution to the problem. What I mean is no on/off config, just a single configuration listing the whitelisted 4lw. If the list is empty it&apos;s off (the map is empty), otw the user can select the commands they would like to expose. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we implement something for 3.4 the same b/w compat argument should hold. i.e. if we do rate limiting in 3.4 we should also have the same functionality in 3.5.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="15867335" author="hanm" created="Wed, 15 Feb 2017 06:31:43 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;The compatibility argument makes most of sense - so how about this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;For both 3.5/3.4, provide a new configuration option that allow admin of ensemble to white list 4lw commands exposed to the world.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;If such an option is not provided in zoo.cfg ZK will choose a list of default commands in white list. Otherwise what&apos;s put in zoo.cfg will overwrite default values.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I think this is a good scoping that balances addressing this specific issue and ease of implementation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rate limiter and deprecating 4lw in favor of AdminServer (for 3.5) can be done as separate issues later (after 3.4.10 / 3.5.3 released). &lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="15868035" author="phunt" created="Wed, 15 Feb 2017 15:33:31 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;That makes sense to me (scoping). What will the default list of 4lw be?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3.4: ruok,srvr,crst,srst,isro,mntr&lt;br/&gt;
3.5: &amp;lt;empty&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note: the full list of supported commands is different from 3.4 to 3.5 (possibly trunk?) - we&apos;ll need to ensure the docs reflect correctly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you think that makes sense? From what I can see these are low cost lookups. Some of the items I left off are more expensive or questionable in terms of whether they should be exposed if a firewall is not used.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or should 3.4 include all commands aside from the two identified in this jira? I&apos;m thinking be safe (smaller list), document this clearly in the docs and in the release notes, and allow the users interesting in exposing more 4lw to do so. Downside is that users may be impacted, i.e. would have to update production configurations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What should we call this? zookeeper.4lw.commands.whitelist ?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We&apos;ll need to verify the list; 4 letters, from the possible set of commands available.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>

&lt;p&gt;I am leaning towards this directions as well. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;zookeeper.4lw.commands.whitelist&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;    I hope, you are planning to deprecate in 3.5.x upcoming releases and may stop supporting this in 3.6.x onwards, right? If yes, then can we create(if not yet created) a jira task to discuss the 4lws deprecation and makes the idea more visible to all.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>

&lt;p&gt;    This new configuration option is provided as &lt;b&gt;both&lt;/b&gt; zoo.cfg option and system properties so users can encode the white list in zoo.cfg and that is the recommended approach as documented in the admin manual, so I don&apos;t see why users have to &quot;passing via command line options&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;    Let&apos;s see if we don&apos;t make it as a system property - then what need change:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Implementation is complicated. We have to add additional logic in QuorumPeerConfig to parse this option explicitly. Right now it naturally fall through the generic system property parsing code.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Unit tests are harder to write. We&apos;d need a way to set these values in unit tests and that implies we either have to add additional setter methods, or have to create zoo.cfg manually which is cumbersome.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;p&gt;    Thus I tend to keep the current implementation unless there is a strong reason not to make this also available as a system property.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>

&lt;p&gt;    Do you meant, you are supporting both options - users can either configure the list in `zoo.cfg` or set as `system properties`? If yes, I&apos;m OK to this approach.  But in the code I could see that server reads the value from `System.getProperty(ZOOKEEPER_4LW_COMMANDS_WHITELIST)` and it is not reading the value from `zoo.cfg`&lt;/p&gt;</comment>

&lt;p&gt;    Thanks everyone for feedback. Updated pull request to address your review comments. One change I made on latest update is to introduce an internal Java system property zookeeper.test.4lw.enabled for tests so we don&apos;t have to copy paste the lengthy set up code for zookeeper.4lw.commands.whitelist property and use  zookeeper.test.4lw.enabled instead providing an elegant switch. zookeeper.4lw.commands.whitelist is still used in some tests to provide complete code coverage for new code paths introduced.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;    All tests should be green now.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/ViewProfile.jspa?name=arshad.mohammad&quot; class=&quot;user-hover&quot; rel=&quot;arshad.mohammad&quot;&gt;arshad.mohammad&lt;/a&gt; Thanks for feedback, this is one way of addressing the issue. I still prefer the current command white list approach because:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;It has a smaller scope than the IP-restriction based approach. It is simpler, less cases to test, and easier to understand.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;One case about IP based approach - what if the access point which IP is white listed gets compromised and admins are not aware of such case (so reconfigure the IP white list will not be done in time)? In that case, this exploit is still possible from the compromised and white listed access point. On the other side, the command white list approach does not have this issue, if the watcher monitoring commands listed in this issue are not white listed, there is no way to exploit.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Overall I think the IP white list approach is a nice to have as it provides the option to use the entire sets of commands while mitigating the potential risk of being exploited - while the command white list approach is a must have based on my previous arguments. I propose we get the command white list patch in, and then the release out, and then think about how to improve the overall access control of ZK in the wild, unless the current command white list does not address the security concern raised by this JIRA. &lt;/p&gt;</comment>

I have create new jira &lt;a href=&quot;https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZOOKEEPER-2699&quot; title=&quot;Restrict 4lw commands based on client IP&quot; class=&quot;issue-link&quot; data-issue-key=&quot;ZOOKEEPER-2699&quot;&gt;&lt;del&gt;ZOOKEEPER-2699&lt;/del&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and have put some more detail there.&lt;br/&gt;
Sure, we can handle after this JIRA is merged. I will review this jira today&lt;/p&gt;</comment>

&lt;p&gt;    if request is for 4lw command, it should be processed in that way only. If false is returned from here, the request will proceed as the normal request.&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;    We should not add new property for test cases, instead use main property for test cases also. may be you can move repetitive test code to utility test class. &lt;/p&gt;</comment>

&lt;p&gt;    I think the original comment was not clear but I think it is a good catch - instead of return false here we return true because the semantic of checkFourLetterWord is we only return false if 4lw is not found, and in that case the caller will think this is a client message and proceed allocate buffer etc work (iiuc that was what the &quot;it should be processed in that way only&quot; meant.).&lt;/p&gt;</comment>

&lt;p&gt;    Introduce this instead of relying on whiteListedCommands.empty to deal with the case where the list is empty and initialized. &lt;/p&gt;</comment>

&lt;p&gt;    While I am on this, this legacy method can be optimized as a boolean query instead of returning a collection, so did the change for this as well (in addition to the white list collection.).&lt;/p&gt;</comment>

&lt;p&gt;There are some 4lw commands which ZooKeeper is using by itself&lt;br/&gt;
For example&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;srvr is used in zookeeper/bin/zkServer.sh status&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;isro is used in org.apache.zookeeper.ClientCnxn.SendThread.pingRwServer()&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;


&lt;p&gt;If we do not enable those commands by default, related funtionalities will not work, so we have to include in the default list&lt;br/&gt;
But if we enable, I do not know if whole purpose of this fix is defeated because the attacker can call the these commands, even though we  are not doing much work in these commands but still the connections will be created for every call.&lt;br/&gt;
Any comments on which option to choose?&lt;/p&gt;</comment>

&lt;p&gt;    We can create a dummy command(ErrorCommand extends AbstractFourLetterCommand ) and execute it and return true same way as SetTraceMaskCommand &lt;br/&gt;
    This ErrorCommand will take care rest of the thing, sending any error message to client and closing the connection etc. &lt;/p&gt;</comment>

&lt;p&gt;    Hi @hanm I have attached a patch in the jira  for your reference. the patch is not complete in itself, merge you changes in that patch to make it complete. &lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="15876313" author="rakeshr" created="Tue, 21 Feb 2017 17:18:23 +0000"  >
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are some 4lw commands which ZooKeeper is using by itself&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Good catch, &lt;a href=&quot;https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/ViewProfile.jspa?name=arshad.mohammad&quot; class=&quot;user-hover&quot; rel=&quot;arshad.mohammad&quot;&gt;arshad.mohammad&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;even though we are not doing much work in these commands but still the connections will be created for every call.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IIUC, these are two problems -&amp;gt; &lt;tt&gt;case-1)&lt;/tt&gt; restrict 4lw cmd execution as few cmds taking too much time for execution. &lt;tt&gt;case-2)&lt;/tt&gt; protection against overuse because it creates many connections.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; I think, &lt;tt&gt;case-1&lt;/tt&gt; is matching with this jira reported issue and we could provide &lt;tt&gt;whitelist&lt;/tt&gt; config in both branches 3.4 and 3.5+ to solve this problem. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In branch-3.4, we could give a simple fix by exposing &lt;tt&gt;whitelist&lt;/tt&gt; configuration and include &lt;tt&gt;srvr, isro&lt;/tt&gt; cmds in default list. Since we have plans to deprecate 4lws in branch-3.5, we could find alternative ways instead of using &lt;tt&gt;srvr, isro&lt;/tt&gt; cmd internally. Probably, we could raise separate jira task and handle this case. &lt;br/&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/ViewProfile.jspa?name=hanm&quot; class=&quot;user-hover&quot; rel=&quot;hanm&quot;&gt;hanm&lt;/a&gt;, could you create a PR for branch-3.4, if no objection from anyone about &lt;tt&gt;whitelist&lt;/tt&gt; idea and that would help to unblock 3.4.10 releasing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;tt&gt;case-2&lt;/tt&gt;, I like &lt;a href=&quot;https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/ViewProfile.jspa?name=phunt&quot; class=&quot;user-hover&quot; rel=&quot;phunt&quot;&gt;phunt&lt;/a&gt;&apos;s idea of introducing configuration to limit the number of 4lw that would be allowed to run in parallel. For example, allows only 1-n number of 4lw cmds to run in parallel. How about raising another jira to implement this instead of clubbing with this issue?&lt;/p&gt;</comment>

&lt;p&gt;    Thanks @arshadmohammad for your suggestion, I like this approach from a user experience point of view as it provides nice error message on client side.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;    I am a little bit concerned that instead of doing a (nearly) NOP on server side to block a command the way the patch is doing now (which just cost a look up), any command including garbage now costs some string printing plus has to go through network stack to send the bytes back. This may lead potential vulnerable point, though it might also be OK as one could argue if we are in such case (ZK server is wide open, every bets is off.). I tend to lean towards the safer side though so I&apos;ll wait for a while for other comments regarding this issue.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>

&lt;p&gt;    @rakeshadr hmmmm I think we did not even close server sockets today for four letter words in general, see &lt;br/&gt;
    &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/apache/zookeeper/blob/master/src/java/main/org/apache/zookeeper/server/NIOServerCnxn.java#L343&quot; class=&quot;external-link&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;https://github.com/apache/zookeeper/blob/master/src/java/main/org/apache/zookeeper/server/NIOServerCnxn.java#L343&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
    and&lt;br/&gt;
    &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/apache/zookeeper/blob/master/src/java/main/org/apache/zookeeper/server/NettyServerCnxn.java#L388&quot; class=&quot;external-link&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;https://github.com/apache/zookeeper/blob/master/src/java/main/org/apache/zookeeper/server/NettyServerCnxn.java#L388&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;    This is not a problem in general for the command line interface because in that case client socket will close first and then server socket will close as a result of client socket close... however if someone writes a client that opens and holds a socket then server will not close the socket even after 4lw finish execution. This probably is a by design as it allows clients to pipe 4lw commands w/o re-opening sockets but I see this is another potential point of vulnerability where a server could run out of sockets..&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;    I think we should probably close the sockets in the two links I posted in the beginning. Let me know what you think @rakeshadr.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>

&lt;p&gt;    @rakeshadr Turns out server socket not closed is a by design. Had a chat with @phunt offline and the idea is we always prefer client to close socket first (which led to server socket close) because a socket close at server might be premature and led to client not getting all the data due to how TCP works. I&apos;ll leave these code as they are.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="15876870" author="hanm" created="Tue, 21 Feb 2017 22:25:30 +0000"  >&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;IIUC, these are two problems -&amp;gt; case-1) restrict 4lw cmd execution as few cmds taking too much time for execution. case-2) protection against overuse because it creates many connections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, this is a good summary. Two problems - one is to fix the obvious exploits related to watcher 4lw and the other is to prevent abuse of 4lw in general. This JIRA&apos;s scope is targeting the first one, which fixes immediate issue and unblocks two important ongoing releases. We can easily get out of scope if we want to completely fix the security of the 4lw which was not designed with security in mind while balancing compatibility and minimize disrupt to existing users, so I&apos;d recommend we stick to the current scope (unless as I mentioned earlier folks feel strongly against the white list approach.).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;could you create a PR for branch-3.4&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will once I get this landed in 3.5. PR to 3.4 will not be much different, but I&apos;d like to finalize this PR first to avoid potential duplicated efforts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, I&apos;ll create a set of follow JIRAs to address concerns of abusing 4lw in general:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;A new config option to turn on / off 4lw w/o a middle ground (sure we can use empty white list for this purpose but a separate option is better IMO from the point of view of deprecating a feature.).&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;4lw rate limiting including concurrent command runs configuration.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Fix client / script to avoid using 4lw - it is unfortunate ZK itself depends on 4lw.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;isro is used in org.apache.zookeeper.ClientCnxn.SendThread.pingRwServer()&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Good catch &lt;a href=&quot;https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/ViewProfile.jspa?name=arshadmohammad&quot; class=&quot;user-hover&quot; rel=&quot;arshadmohammad&quot;&gt;arshadmohammad&lt;/a&gt; -  I hope this is an exhaustive list of 4lw used by ZK &lt;img class=&quot;emoticon&quot; src=&quot;https://issues.apache.org/jira/images/icons/emoticons/smile.png&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; width=&quot;16&quot; align=&quot;absmiddle&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot;/&gt; are there other commands used by ZK itself if you may know?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Read only server is disabled by default, so we can leave isro out of white list by default and document in admin manual that if read only server is enabled, this command must be put back in white list. We can use a separate JIRA to get ride of isro from ZooKeeper client library later. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For srvr, it is only used in zkServer.sh&apos;s stat option - not sure if anyone actually use this feature but we could just remove the Stat option from zkServer.sh so we don&apos;t have to include srvr in whitelist. Another option is to include srvr in white list by default for 3.4/3.5. I think include it by default in whitelist sounds the way to go from a compatibility point of view.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>

&lt;p&gt;Makes sense to me. If I understand your comment correctly, we could push &lt;tt&gt;whitelist config&lt;/tt&gt; changes first which will unblock 3.4.10 releasing. But for 3.5.3 releasing, we need both &lt;tt&gt;whitelist config&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;deprecating 4lw tasks&lt;/tt&gt; together. Probably, &lt;tt&gt;4lw rate limiting task&lt;/tt&gt; is nice to have feature(keep it low priority compare to other tasks), right?&lt;/p&gt;</comment>

                            <comment id="15881932" author="rakeshr" created="Fri, 24 Feb 2017 04:37:06 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;I&apos;m trying an attempt to unblock 3.4.10 and 3.5.3 releases. Following are few proposals to make the release happen by including the reported issue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;3.4.10 requirement:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Expose whitelist configuration with the default values,&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;tt&gt;4lw.commands.whitelist=ruok,srvr,crst,srst,isro,mntr&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Also, properly documenting the &lt;tt&gt;Publicly accessible deployment&lt;/tt&gt; part from the current PR_179 changes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;3.5.3 requirement:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
IMHO, there are two possible proposals:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;ins&gt;Proposal-1)&lt;/ins&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
       Expose whitelist configuration with the default values,&lt;br/&gt;
       &lt;tt&gt;4lw.commands.whitelist=srvr,isro&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
        Also, recommend users to use admin server rather than 4lw cmds considering that 4lw will deprecated in future.&lt;br/&gt;
       Then, later in 3.5.4, we could make this whitelist &amp;lt;empty&amp;gt; and while deprecating will replace srvr, isro calls with better solution. That way, we would get enough time to think about better solutions.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;ins&gt;Proposal-2)&lt;/ins&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Expose whitelist configuration with the empty default value,&lt;br/&gt;
       &lt;tt&gt;4lw.commands.whitelist=&amp;lt;empty&amp;gt;&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;(a) How about zkServer.sh usage of &quot;srvr&quot; can be achieved like,&lt;br/&gt;
       Introduce a new admin API, admin#getServerStatus(&quot;host:port&quot;), which will return running stat of that server(probably, the same string format where srvr command is returning)
&lt;div class=&quot;code panel&quot; style=&quot;border-width: 1px;&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;codeContent panelContent&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;code-java&quot;&gt;&quot;version=&amp;lt;full_version&amp;gt;
read_only=&lt;span class=&quot;code-keyword&quot;&gt;false&lt;/span&gt;
server_stats=&amp;lt;statistics&amp;gt;
node_count=&amp;lt;count&amp;gt;&quot;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;(b) Client#pingRwServer=&amp;gt; Just a plain thought, probably, readonly client code can internally tries to establish new client session with all other servers round robin fashion. Then, check whether that the connected server is in &lt;tt&gt;rw&lt;/tt&gt; mode and act upon.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;    I&apos;ve few comments, please see:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;    comment-1) I agree that these commands are very much needed for ZK functionality and cannot be disabled. I hope you have coded with that point in mind. In general, default values can be overridden, but here these are mandatory values. Can we document conveying these thoughts. Presently the documentation says that `&quot;The default value is empty, which disables all Four Letter Words command.&quot;`&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;    comment-2) Say, user keeps `4lw.commands.whitelist=&amp;lt;empty&amp;gt;`, then `System.getProperty(ZOOKEEPER_4LW_COMMANDS_WHITELIST)` will be null and these two commands will not be added to `whiteListedCommands`, right?&lt;/p&gt;</comment>

&lt;p&gt;    @rakeshadr thanks for feedback, updated patch. I also did an optimization that only conditionally enables &quot;isro&quot; only when read only mode is enabled (readonly mode is disabled by default.) with a test case, so we don&apos;t have to say that &quot;isro&quot; is also enabled by default in doc (the less implementation details we mention there the better imo.).&lt;/p&gt;</comment>

&lt;p&gt;    Currently enabling all the 4lw commands is little inconvenient. We have to put all the commands one by one to enable all the commands. Given the fact that ZooKeeper is generally installed in private network within secure boundaries. Can we introduce some keyword to include all the commands? For example&lt;br/&gt;
    4lw.commands.whitelist=all&lt;br/&gt;
    or &lt;br/&gt;
    4lw.commands.whitelist=*&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;    Another stab to address comments from @arshadmohammad &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Introduced 4lw.commands.whitelist=* as a convient configuration option to enable all 4lw, with new test.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Remove dead code.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;    ZKTestCase is base test class, covering a test scenario from this class should be avoided. May be you can add more test case in FourLetterWordsWhiteListTest to increase the coverage.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>

&lt;p&gt;    Similar as pull request 179, this PR introduces new property zookeeper.4lw.commands.whitelist to branch-3.4.&lt;br/&gt;
    Unlike branch-3.5 where all 4lw (with few exceptions) is disabled by default, for branch-3.4 only &quot;wchp&quot; and &quot;wchc&quot; are disabled by default - since 4lw is widely used and there is no alternatives in branch-3.4 so we just disable the exploitable ones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can merge this pull request into a Git repository by running:&lt;/p&gt;
