                    <description>&lt;p&gt;Since version 3.4, the quorum of followers and the leader did not synchronize the files immediately when the synchronization was completed, and the data was not persisted to the files in an instant, and at this time the zk server can provide external access, such as webapp access, if it appears at this time Failure, phantom reading may occur&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hi Xun,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think this is a bug, your test case is sound to me. Do you mind&lt;br/&gt;
 creating a JIRA for this issue?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Followers should not ACK NEWLEADER without ACK every transaction from the&lt;br/&gt;
 DIFF sync. To ACK every transaction, a follower either persists the&lt;br/&gt;
 transaction in log, or takes a snapshot before sending the ACK of the&lt;br/&gt;
 NEWLEADER (which we did, before &lt;a href=&quot;https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZOOKEEPER-2678&quot; title=&quot;Large databases take a long time to regain a quorum&quot; class=&quot;issue-link&quot; data-issue-key=&quot;ZOOKEEPER-2678&quot;&gt;&lt;del&gt;ZOOKEEPER-2678&lt;/del&gt;&lt;/a&gt; where the snapshot&lt;br/&gt;
 optimization was introduced).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A potential fix I have in mind is to make sure to persist all DIFF sync&lt;br/&gt;
 proposals from LEADER (similar to what we are already doing for proposals&lt;br/&gt;
 coming between NEWLEADER and UPTODATE). By doing so, when the leader&lt;br/&gt;
 receives NEWLEADER ACK from a quorum, it&apos;s guaranteed that&lt;br/&gt;
 every transaction leader DIFF sync to follower is quorum committed. Thus&lt;br/&gt;
 there will not be inconsistent views moving forward. Alternatively we can&lt;br/&gt;
 take a snapshot before ACK NEWLEADER but that will be a big performance hit&lt;br/&gt;
 for big data trees.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am also interested to hear what others think about this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since version 3.4, the quorum of followers and the leader did not&lt;br/&gt;
 synchronize the files immediately when the synchronization was completed,&lt;br/&gt;
 and the data was not persisted to the files in an instant, and at this time&lt;br/&gt;
 the zk server can provide external access, such as webapp access, if it&lt;br/&gt;
 appears at this time Failure, phantom reading may occur&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&#160;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;@&#26446;&#29667;The situation you describe may have conceptual deviations about how&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;the consensus protocol works:---&amp;gt; Since the data of the follower when the&lt;br/&gt;
 follower uses the DIFF method to synchronize with the leader is still in&lt;br/&gt;
 the memory, it has not had time to persist1. The write path is: write&lt;br/&gt;
 transaction log(WAL) firstly, after reaching a consensus, then apply to&lt;br/&gt;
 memory, other than the opposite.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;---&amp;gt; but at this time, the latest zxid_n of the leader has not been&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;supported by the quorum of the follower. At this time, if a client connects&lt;br/&gt;
 to the leader and sees zxid_n,2. If a write has not been supported by the&lt;br/&gt;
 quorum, it&apos;s not safe to apply to the state machine and the client is not&lt;br/&gt;
 able to see this write.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I guess that your question may be: how the system handles the&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;uncommitted logs when leader changes?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#160;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How is it that participant A would have a later zxid than the leader?&lt;br/&gt;
 In particular, it seems to me that it should be impossible to have these&lt;br/&gt;
 two facts be true:&lt;br/&gt;
 1) a transaction has been committed with zxid = z_0. This implies that a&lt;br/&gt;
 quorum of the cluster has accepted this transaction and it has been&lt;br/&gt;
 committed.&lt;br/&gt;
 2) a new leader election nominates a leader with latest zxid &amp;lt; z_0.&lt;br/&gt;
 My reasoning is that any new leader election has to involve a quorum and&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;at&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;least a sufficient number of that quorum must have accepted zxid &amp;gt;= z_0&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;and&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;therefore would refuse to be part of the quorum (this is a&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;contradiction).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus, no leader could be elected with zxid &amp;lt; z_0 if fact (1) is true.&lt;br/&gt;
 What you are describing seems to require both of these facts.&lt;br/&gt;
 Perhaps I am missing something about your suggested scenario. Could you&lt;br/&gt;
 describe what you are thinking in more detail?&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Start 3 servers 0, 1, 2.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;2 is elected leader, tune it&apos;s tick time to delay it&apos;s looking so we can proposal a transaction.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Shutdown 0, and 1.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Proposal transaction T on 2.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Restart 0, and 1.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;0 and 1 DIFF sync with 2 (leader), and send ACK of NEWLEADER to 2.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Verify client of 2 has the view of the T.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Shutdown 2.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Tricky part - make sure to shutdown 0 and 1 (the followers) &lt;b&gt;before&lt;/b&gt; they can sync the DIFF to disk. This is extremely timing sensitive as we already buffer the DIFF and sync them &lt;b&gt;after&lt;/b&gt; ACK NEWLEADER.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Restart 0 and 1, form a new quorum.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Verify client of 0 and 1 does not have the view of T, a violation of ZAB.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am very sorry that this problem has not been encountered in the production environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How did I discover this problem:&lt;br/&gt;
Recently I studied the code of zookeeper 3.6 and two papers &quot;A simple totally ordered broadcast protocol&quot; and &quot;Zab: High-performance broadcast for primary-backup systems&quot;. But when I checked the code, I found that the code did not meet the requirements of zab. Then I searched the modification history of the code and found that there was a modification to this on github, which occurred in 2017. But the modification on this has been closed, and it was recognized by many people at that time. So I think it may be that I am wrong, it may be that I have a deviation in my understanding of the ZAB agreement. So I found the email group of zookeeper and wanted to confirm this issue. If it is indeed my misunderstanding, then I can use the new version with peace of mind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Probability of this problem:&lt;br/&gt;
Because this problem is an extreme situation I simulated based on ZAB theory, there is only a theoretical possibility, if it is found in a production environment that at least two conditions are met&lt;br/&gt;
1. The above situation occurs&lt;br/&gt;
2. Clients (such as webapp) have high requirements for consistent data reading, and if non-consistent reading occurs, it may cause great losses, but this important scenario generally has other guarantees Measures to fix the results.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So it is not easy to meet the above two conditions in production, so it is not easy to find. But because this problem violates the ZAB theory, it always makes me a little worried during use&lt;/p&gt;</comment>

I have submit my test case in PR 1445 where I have to deterministically inject a fault to precisely let followers fail at same time at certain phase during sync. It might happen in production if the quorum is serving heavy traffic with IO contentions on followers, though, but I never saw such case. I think this bug should get a fix because data consistency is super important for ZooKeeper. I am working on patch.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>

It seems that follower and leader does not have the same view after some tests.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>

&lt;p&gt;It looks like the&#160;&#160; &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/apache/zookeeper/pull/1445&quot; class=&quot;external-link&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;GitHub Pull Request #1445&lt;/a&gt;&#160;cause the compilation issue in branch-3.6. The error is &quot;package org.junit.jupiter.api does not exist&quot;. Can you please take a look at it?&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="17517194" author="JIRAUSER287593" created="Tue, 5 Apr 2022 03:49:08 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;I think this is a bug, your test case is sound to me. Do you mind&lt;br/&gt;
creating a JIRA for this issue?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Followers should not ACK NEWLEADER without ACK every transaction from the&lt;br/&gt;
DIFF sync. To ACK every transaction, a follower either persists the&lt;br/&gt;
transaction in log, or takes a snapshot before sending the ACK of the&lt;br/&gt;
NEWLEADER (which we did, before&#160;&lt;a href=&quot;https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZOOKEEPER-2678&quot; title=&quot;Large databases take a long time to regain a quorum&quot; class=&quot;issue-link&quot; data-issue-key=&quot;ZOOKEEPER-2678&quot;&gt;&lt;del&gt;ZOOKEEPER-2678&lt;/del&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&#160;where the snapshot&lt;br/&gt;
optimization was introduced).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A potential fix I have in mind is to make sure to persist all DIFF sync&lt;br/&gt;
proposals from LEADER (similar to what we are already doing for proposals&lt;br/&gt;
coming between NEWLEADER and UPTODATE). By doing so, when the leader&lt;br/&gt;
receives NEWLEADER ACK from a quorum, it&apos;s guaranteed that&lt;br/&gt;
every transaction leader DIFF sync to follower is quorum committed. Thus&lt;br/&gt;
there will not be inconsistent views moving forward. Alternatively we can&lt;br/&gt;
take a snapshot before ACK NEWLEADER but that will be a big performance hit&lt;br/&gt;
for big data trees.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am also interested to hear what others think about this.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
