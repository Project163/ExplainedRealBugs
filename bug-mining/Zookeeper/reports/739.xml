            <title>[ZOOKEEPER-2243] Supported platforms is completely out of date</title>
                <link>https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZOOKEEPER-2243</link>
                <project id="12310801" key="ZOOKEEPER">ZooKeeper</project>
                    <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://zookeeper.apache.org/doc/r3.4.6/zookeeperAdmin.html#sc_supportedPlatforms&quot; class=&quot;external-link&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;http://zookeeper.apache.org/doc/r3.4.6/zookeeperAdmin.html#sc_supportedPlatforms&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It refers to Solaris as Sun Solaris so it&apos;s at least 5 years out of date.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We should &quot;support&quot; the platforms that we are running zookeeper on regularly, so I suggest paring it down to linux and windows (mac os doesn&apos;t really count because people don&apos;t run it on servers anymore). Everything else should be &quot;may work, not supported, but will fix obvious bugs&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

                            <comment id="14681576" author="fpj" created="Tue, 11 Aug 2015 10:13:18 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;We have a solaris build queue on jenkins, I believe some of our users cared about it. I&apos;m fine with Linux, but I&apos;m not sure about removing mac os. I understand that folks don&apos;t run it in production, but many devs use macs to develop, so I think we should try to make it work on a mac. I&apos;m not sure what to do about Windows. We don&apos;t have any committer or strong contributors to support Windows. There is even a recent jira with a .NET client that got very little attention. I personally don&apos;t have a machine to run windows tests any longer. &lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="14681586" author="ikelly" created="Tue, 11 Aug 2015 10:34:15 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;That solaris build on jenkins hasn&apos;t passed in years. I don&apos;t think there are many places even using solaris now. Joyent is the only one I can think off offhand. Which is a pity. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regarding Mac OSX, when you support something, I take it to mean, this will work in production for you and if it doesn&apos;t thats a major bug. It doesn&apos;t mean it won&apos;t work. That said I&apos;ve no problem with having Mac OSX on the list. It does get plenty of testing on Mac in any case.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Windows, I think Huawei were using it on windows. Perhaps &lt;a href=&quot;https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/ViewProfile.jspa?name=rakeshr&quot; class=&quot;user-hover&quot; rel=&quot;rakeshr&quot;&gt;rakeshr&lt;/a&gt; could enlighten us. &lt;/p&gt;</comment>

But for the development and testing purpose we use Windows environment and running both servers/clients there. I feel it is OK to mention &lt;tt&gt;development platform&lt;/tt&gt; in the document like today we have. I remember few people queried in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://qnalist.com/questions/4669709/windows-support-win-64&quot; class=&quot;external-link&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;mailing list about the Windows support&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</comment>

We&apos;re clearly not supporting it in production as there&apos;s been a bug (&lt;a href=&quot;https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZOOKEEPER-2244&quot; title=&quot;On Windows zookeeper fails to restart&quot; class=&quot;issue-link&quot; data-issue-key=&quot;ZOOKEEPER-2244&quot;&gt;&lt;del&gt;ZOOKEEPER-2244&lt;/del&gt;&lt;/a&gt;) in 3.5 since it went out.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>

&lt;p&gt;+1 from me. Will help in fixing ZooKeeper bugs reported on Windows platform. BTW I noticed &lt;a href=&quot;https://builds.apache.org/job/ZooKeeper-trunk-WinVS2008/&quot; class=&quot;external-link&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;ZooKeeper&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://builds.apache.org/computer/windows1&quot; class=&quot;external-link&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;windows build&lt;/a&gt; is not running, any one has idea about this.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="14682066" author="cnauroth" created="Tue, 11 Aug 2015 16:50:15 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;I know of multiple deployments running ZooKeeper in production on Windows (both client and server).  It would be great if the community can consider declaring Windows to be part of the official supported platform list.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regarding the build, it looks like there is just a single Windows Jenkins host that can serve as executor for the job, and it appears to be offline.  This likely needs follow up with INFRA.  I&apos;ll aim to check with INFRA tomorrow, unless someone else beats me to it today.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>

Here is a clean Windows build from 8/18:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It has been failing on tests for a long time, even though compilation was fixed in &lt;a href=&quot;https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZOOKEEPER-1077&quot; title=&quot;C client lib doesn&amp;#39;t build on Solaris&quot; class=&quot;issue-link&quot; data-issue-key=&quot;ZOOKEEPER-1077&quot;&gt;&lt;del&gt;ZOOKEEPER-1077&lt;/del&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know &lt;a href=&quot;https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/ViewProfile.jspa?name=alanburlison&quot; class=&quot;user-hover&quot; rel=&quot;alanburlison&quot;&gt;alanburlison&lt;/a&gt; has been driving some Solaris compatibility work over in Hadoop.  Alan, do your plans also include looking at ZooKeeper on Solaris?&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="14703034" author="alanburlison" created="Wed, 19 Aug 2015 13:43:57 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;I don&apos;t have any immediate plans but I can add it to the list to look at. I need to get Hadoop working first though &lt;img class=&quot;emoticon&quot; src=&quot;https://issues.apache.org/jira/images/icons/emoticons/wink.png&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; width=&quot;16&quot; align=&quot;absmiddle&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</comment>

That said, zk support for solaris shouldn&apos;t be so hard. It doesn&apos;t require any jni stuff like hadoop does. However, if we do support it, we should have a build for it and we should gate commits on solaris builds passing also. &lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="14703501" author="alanburlison" created="Wed, 19 Aug 2015 18:13:43 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;I&apos;m happy to help/advise on the Solaris front but I&apos;m not really clear what the problem is that needs fixing.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="14703727" author="fpj" created="Wed, 19 Aug 2015 20:56:45 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;hey &lt;a href=&quot;https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/ViewProfile.jspa?name=alanburlison&quot; class=&quot;user-hover&quot; rel=&quot;alanburlison&quot;&gt;alanburlison&lt;/a&gt;, you could check the jenkins build which has been failing forever.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="14703929" author="cnauroth" created="Wed, 19 Aug 2015 23:16:23 +0000"  >&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Isn&apos;t zk support a prerequisite for hadoop on solaris?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ZooKeeper isn&apos;t strictly a requirement for Hadoop.  It becomes a requirement though if you want to run an HA deployment for some of the critical daemons like NameNode and ResourceManager.  Their HA architecture uses an active/standby pair coordinating on a distributed lock using ZooKeeper.  Realistic production deployments would want this functionality.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="14703936" author="cnauroth" created="Wed, 19 Aug 2015 23:19:47 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;It looks like we have a functional build after the &lt;a href=&quot;https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZOOKEEPER-1077&quot; title=&quot;C client lib doesn&amp;#39;t build on Solaris&quot; class=&quot;issue-link&quot; data-issue-key=&quot;ZOOKEEPER-1077&quot;&gt;&lt;del&gt;ZOOKEEPER-1077&lt;/del&gt;&lt;/a&gt; patch fixed the native code compilation problem.  However, it also looks like the Solaris build has a long history of intermittent test failures that don&apos;t repro in other environments.  I expect getting to a completely green build would require trying to repro the test failures on Solaris and then investigating further to determine if there is a bad assumption in a test or a legitimate problem in the main ZooKeeper code.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="14703959" author="cnauroth" created="Wed, 19 Aug 2015 23:35:17 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;The ZooKeeper codebase at this point has multiple sub-components, and I wonder if the statement of support needs a more specific breakdown per component.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Ivan pointed out, the main client and server pieces don&apos;t have any native code requirements.  I expect it isn&apos;t too much burden to support a wide variety of platforms for the client and server, as long as we stick to some rules in the Java code, like avoiding hard-coded file path separators.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Support gets a lot trickier for the native client.  In that case, we&apos;d need a healthy base of contributors familiar with each platform and available to field bug reports.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then there is contrib, where it seems like contributors are sparse.  Some contrib modules like zkfuse contain native code, so they&apos;ll have the same challenges as the native client.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Based on that, I wonder if we need something more like a matrix listing client/server/native client/etc. on one axis and OS on the other axis, and yes or no in each box.  Transitioning one of those boxes from no to yes ought to require some thought and agreement about whether or not the community is capable of taking on the extra support burden.  If not, then it might require recruiting some additional contributors to help before making the commitment.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="14704541" author="ikelly" created="Thu, 20 Aug 2015 09:00:05 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;I wouldn&apos;t even try to support the native client in solaris until someone explicitly asks for that support. And the contrib modules, even less so. &lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="14718482" author="alanburlison" created="Fri, 28 Aug 2015 12:40:00 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;I am working on getting all the native parts of Hadoop working properly on Solaris, I can take a look at Zookeeper after that. Having a matrix to help identify which bits to look at first would indeed be a big help.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="14718490" author="ikelly" created="Fri, 28 Aug 2015 12:44:31 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;Ok. Lets check in again once there&apos;s a release pending and update the doc at that point.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>

For the content of the matrix (what we&apos;re committing to support), I summarized the conversation here that a few of us came to agreement on.  Please do check that I got this information right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only additional thing that wasn&apos;t discussed here is FreeBSD.  I added it to the matrix with support for the Java side but not the native side or contrib.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>

&lt;p&gt;small nit: Please remove one extra space before &lt;tt&gt;Some components&lt;/tt&gt; while committing the patch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;code panel&quot; style=&quot;border-width: 1px;&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;codeContent panelContent&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;code-java&quot;&gt;multiple components.  Some components
&lt;/pre&gt;

                            <comment id="15012350" author="cnauroth" created="Wed, 18 Nov 2015 23:26:17 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;I just noticed that we&apos;ll need a slightly different patch file for branch-3.4.  On that branch, we have a mention that NIO support is broken in the JVM on FreeBSD.  This slightly different text causes the trunk patch to fail to apply.  As per discussion in &lt;a href=&quot;https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZOOKEEPER-1509&quot; title=&quot;Please update documentation to reflect updated FreeBSD support.&quot; class=&quot;issue-link&quot; data-issue-key=&quot;ZOOKEEPER-1509&quot;&gt;&lt;del&gt;ZOOKEEPER-1509&lt;/del&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, this is out-dated information, so I have removed this statement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/ViewProfile.jspa?name=rgs&quot; class=&quot;user-hover&quot; rel=&quot;rgs&quot;&gt;rgs&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/ViewProfile.jspa?name=rakeshr&quot; class=&quot;user-hover&quot; rel=&quot;rakeshr&quot;&gt;rakeshr&lt;/a&gt;, could you please review the branch-3.4 patch too?  Once I have a +1 on that, I&apos;ll commit to all relevant branches.  Thanks!&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
