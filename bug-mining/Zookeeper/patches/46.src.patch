 <div class="section">
-<p>ZooKeeper uses ACLs to control access to its znodes (the data nodes of a ZooKeeper data tree). The ACL implementation is quite similar to UNIX file access permissions: it employs permission bits to allow/disallow various operations against a node and the scope to which the bits apply. Unlike standard UNIX permissions, a ZooKeeper node is not limited by the three standard scopes for user (owner of the file), group, and world (other). ZooKeeper does not have a notion of an owner of a znode. Instead, an ACL specifies sets of ids and permissions that are associated with those ids.</p>
-<p>ZooKeeper supports pluggable authentication schemes. Ids are specified using the form <em>scheme:id</em>, where <em>scheme</em> is a the authentication scheme that the id corresponds to. For example, <em>host:host1.corp.com</em> is an id for a host named <em>host1.corp.com</em>.</p>
-<p>When a client connects to ZooKeeper and authenticates itself, ZooKeeper associates all the ids that correspond to a client with the clients connection. These ids are checked against the ACLs of znodes when a clients tries to access a node. ACLs are made up of pairs of <em>(scheme:expression, perms)</em>. The format of the <em>expression</em> is specific to the scheme. For example, the pair <em>(ip:19.22.0.0/16, READ)</em> gives the <em>READ</em> permission to any clients with an IP address that starts with 19.22.</p>

-    <para>ZooKeeper uses ACLs to control access to its znodes (the data nodes of a ZooKeeper data tree). The ACL implementation is quite similar to UNIX file access permissions: it employs permission bits to allow/disallow various operations against a node and the scope to which the bits apply. Unlike standard UNIX permissions, a ZooKeeper node is not limited by the three standard scopes for user (owner of the file), group, and world (other). ZooKeeper does not have a notion of an owner of a znode. Instead, an ACL specifies sets of ids and permissions that are associated with those ids.</para>
-
-    <para>ZooKeeper supports pluggable authentication schemes. Ids are specified using the form <emphasis>scheme:id</emphasis>, where <emphasis>scheme</emphasis> is a the authentication scheme that the id corresponds to. For example, <emphasis>host:host1.corp.com</emphasis> is an id for a host named <emphasis>host1.corp.com</emphasis>.</para>
-
-    <para>When a client connects to ZooKeeper and authenticates itself, ZooKeeper associates all the ids that correspond to a client with the clients connection. These ids are checked against the ACLs of znodes when a clients tries to access a node. ACLs are made up of pairs of <emphasis>(scheme:expression, perms)</emphasis>. The format of the <emphasis>expression</emphasis> is specific to the scheme. For example, the pair <emphasis>(ip:19.22.0.0/16, READ)</emphasis> gives the <emphasis>READ</emphasis> permission to any clients with an IP address that starts with 19.22.</para>

+    <para>ZooKeeper supports pluggable authentication schemes. Ids are
+    specified using the form <emphasis>scheme:id</emphasis>,
+    where <emphasis>scheme</emphasis> is a the authentication scheme
+    that the id corresponds to. For
+    example, <emphasis>host:host1.corp.com</emphasis> is an id for a
+    host named <emphasis>host1.corp.com</emphasis>.</para>
+
+    <para>When a client connects to ZooKeeper and authenticates
+    itself, ZooKeeper associates all the ids that correspond to a
+    client with the clients connection. These ids are checked against
+    the ACLs of znodes when a clients tries to access a node. ACLs are
+    made up of pairs of <emphasis>(scheme:expression,
+    perms)</emphasis>. The format of
+    the <emphasis>expression</emphasis> is specific to the scheme. For
+    example, the pair <emphasis>(ip:19.22.0.0/16, READ)</emphasis>
+    gives the <emphasis>READ</emphasis> permission to any clients with
