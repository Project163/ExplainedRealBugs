+<strong>New in 3.6.0:</strong> The default

+          is found is to set zxid to zero and join the quorum as a
+          voting member. This can be dangerous if some event (e.g. a
+          rogue 'rm -rf') has removed the data directory while the
+          server was down since this server may help elect a leader
+          that is missing transactions. Enabling db existence validation
+          will change the behavior on startup when no data tree is
+          found: the server joins the ensemble as a non-voting participant
+          until it is able to sync with the leader and acquire an up-to-date
+          version of the ensemble data. To indicate an empty data tree is
+          expected (ensemble creation), the user should place a file
+          'initialize' in the same directory as 'myid'. This file will
+          be detected and deleted by the server on startup.
