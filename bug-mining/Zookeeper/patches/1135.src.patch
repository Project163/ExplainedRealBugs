 INSTALLATION
 
-If you're building the client from a source checkout you need to
-follow the steps outlined below. If you're building from a release
-tar downloaded from Apache please skip to step 2.
-
-1) do a "ant compile_jute" from the zookeeper top level directory (.../trunk).
-   This will create a directory named "generated" under zookeeper-client/zookeeper-client-c.
-   Skip to step 3.
-2) unzip/untar the source tarball and cd to the zookeeper-x.x.x/zookeeper-client/zookeeper-client-c directory
-3) change directory to zookeeper-client/zookeeper-client-c and do a "autoreconf -if" to bootstrap
-   autoconf, automake and libtool. Please make sure you have autoconf
-   version 2.59 or greater installed. If cppunit is installed in a non-standard
-   directory, you need to specify where to find cppunit.m4. For example, if
-   cppunit is installed under /usr/local, run:
-   
-       ACLOCAL="aclocal -I /usr/local/share/aclocal" autoreconf -if
-
-4) do a "./configure [OPTIONS]" to generate the makefile. See INSTALL
-   for general information about running configure. Additionally, the
-   configure supports the following options:
-   --enable-debug     enables optimization and enables debug info compiler
-                      options, disabled by default
-   --without-syncapi  disables Sync API support; zookeeper_mt library won't
-                      be built, enabled by default
-   --disable-static   do not build static libraries, enabled by default
-   --disable-shared   do not build shared libraries, enabled by default
-   --without-cppunit  do not build the test library, enabled by default.
-
-5) do a "make" or "make install" to build the libraries and install them. 
-   Alternatively, you can also build and run a unit test suite (and
-   you probably should).  Please make sure you have cppunit-1.10.x or
-   higher installed before you execute step 4.  Once ./configure has
-   finished, do a "make check". It will build the libraries, build
-   the tests and run them.
-6) to generate doxygen documentation do a "make doxygen-doc". All
-   documentations will be placed to a new subfolder named docs. By
-   default only HTML documentation is generated.  For information on
-   other document formats please use "./configure --help"
-
-Alternatively you can use the CMake build system. On Windows, this is required.
-Follow steps 1 and 2 above, and then continue here.
-
-1) do a "cmake [OPTIONS]" to generate the makefile or msbuild files (the correct
-   build system will be generated based on your platform). Some options from above
-   are supported:
-   -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE  Debug by default, Release enables optimzation etc.
-   -DWANT_SYNCAPI      ON by default, OFF disables the Sync API support
-   -DWANT_CPPUNIT      ON except on Windows, OFF disables the tests
-   -DWITH_OPENSSL      ON by default, OFF disables the SSL support. You can also
-                       specify a custom path by -DWITH_OPENSSL=/path/to/openssl/
-   -DWITH_CYRUS_SASL   ON by default, OFF disables SASL support. You can also
-                       specify a custom path by -DWITH_CYRUS_SASL=/path/to/cyrus-sasl/
-   -DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS not yet supported, only static libraries are built
-   other CMake options see "cmake --help" for generic options, such as generator
-
-2) do a "cmake --build ." to build the default targets. Alternatively you can
-   invoke "make" or "msbuild" manually. If the tests were enabled, use "ctest -V"
-   to run them.
-
-Current limitations of the CMake build system include lack of Solaris support,
-no shared library option, no explicitly exported symbols (all are exported by
-default), no versions on the libraries, and no documentation generation.
-Features of CMake include a single, easily consumed cross-platform build system
-to generate the ZooKeeper C Client libraries for any project, with little to no
-configuration.
