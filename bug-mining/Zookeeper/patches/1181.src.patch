+         We have updated jetty[1] to 9.4.57.v20241219[2] which includes a fix[3] for CVE-2024-6763[4].
+         But it is not listed as fixed version since 9.x is EOL[5]. So we still have to suppress this
+         to pass vulnerabilities check. Besides above, ZooKeeper does not use HttpURI[6] thus should
+         not be affected by this CVE anyway.
