+    |  This is the Apache Cocoon command line configuration file.
+    |  Here you give the command line interface details of where
+    |  to find various aspects of your Cocoon installation.
+    |
+    |  If you wish, you can also use this file to specify the URIs
+    |  that you wish to generate.
+    |
+    |  The current configuration information in this file is for
+    |  building the Cocoon documentation. Therefore, all links here
+    |  are relative to the build context dir, which, in the build.xml
+    |  file, is set to ${build.context}
+    |
+    |  Options:
+    |    verbose:            increase amount of information presented
+    |                        to standard output (default: false)
+    |    follow-links:       whether linked pages should also be
+    |                        generated (default: true)
+    |    precompile-only:    precompile sitemaps and XSP pages, but
+    |                        do not generate any pages (default: false)
+    |    confirm-extensions: check the mime type for the generated page
+    |                        and adjust filename and links extensions
+    |                        to match the mime type
+    |                        (e.g. text/html->.html)
+    |
+    |  Note: Whilst using an xconf file to configure the Cocoon
+    |        Command Line gives access to more features, the use of
+    |        command line parameters is more stable, as there are
+    |        currently plans to improve the xconf format to allow
+    |        greater flexibility. If you require a stable and
+    |        consistent method for accessing the CLI, it is recommended
+    |        that you use the command line parameters to configure
+    |        the CLI. See documentation at:
+    |        http://cocoon.apache.org/2.1/userdocs/offline/
+    |        http://wiki.apache.org/cocoon/CommandLine

+       |  use this <user-agent> entry to provide a 'fake' user agent
+       |  to Cocoon, so that it generates the correct version of your
+       |  site.

+       |  User agents can specify to an HTTP server what types of content
+       |  (by mime-type) they are able to receive. E.g. a browser may be
+       |  able to handle jpegs, but not pngs. The HTTP accept header
+       |  allows the server to take the browser's capabilities into account,
+       |  and only send back content that it can handle.

+       |  For most sites, this can be ignored.

+       | Specifies which URIs should be included or excluded, according
+       | to wildcard patterns.
+       |
+       | These includes/excludes are only relevant when you are following
+       | links. A link URI must match an include pattern (if one is given)
+       | and not match an exclude pattern, if it is to be followed by
+       | Cocoon. It can be useful, for example, where there are links in
+       | your site to pages that are not generated by Cocoon, such as
+       | references to api-documentation.
+       |
+       | By default, all URIs are included. If both include and exclude
+       | patterns are specified, a URI is first checked against the
+       | include patterns, and then against the exclude patterns.
+       |
+       | Multiple patterns can be given, using muliple include or exclude

+       |  They describe the way the URI of the generated file is created
+       |  from the source page's URI. There are three ways that a generated
+       |  file URI can be created: append, replace and insert.
+       |
+       |  The "type" attribute specifies one of (append|replace|insert):
+       |
+       |  append:
+       |  Append the generated page's URI to the end of the source URI:
+       |
+       |   <uri type="append" src-prefix="documents/" src="index.html"
+       |   dest="build/dest/"/>
+       |
+       |  This means that
+       |   (1) the "documents/index.html" page is generated
+       |   (2) the file will be written to "build/dest/documents/index.html"
+       |
+       |  replace:
+       |  Completely ignore the generated page's URI - just
+       |  use the destination URI:
+       |
+       |   <uri type="replace" src-prefix="documents/" src="index.html"
+       |   dest="build/dest/docs.html"/>
+       |
+       |  This means that
+       |   (1) the "documents/index.html" page is generated
+       |   (2) the result is written to "build/dest/docs.html"
+       |   (3) this works only for "single" pages - and not when links
+       |       are followed
+       |
+       |  insert:
+       |  Insert generated page's URI into the destination
+       |  URI at the point marked with a * (example uses fictional
+       |  zip protocol)
+       |
+       |   <uri type="insert" src-prefix="documents/" src="index.html"
+       |   dest="zip://*.zip/page.html"/>
+       |
+       |  This means that
+       |   (1)
+       |
+       |  In any of these scenarios, if the dest attribute is omitted,
+       |  the value provided globally using the <dest-dir> node will
+       |  be used instead.

+       | enables a group of URIs to share properties. The following
+       | properties can be set for a group of URIs:
+       |   * follow-links:       should pages be crawled for links
+       |   * confirm-extensions: should file extensions be checked

+       | Each <uris> node can have a name attribute. When a name

-<title>Migration Instructions when Upgrading to 3.0.0</title>
-
-<para>
-<emphasis>You should only have to read this section if you are upgrading from a previous version of ZooKeeper to version 3.0.0, otw skip down to <ulink url="#changes">changes</ulink></emphasis>
-</para>
-
-<para>
-A small number of changes in this release have resulted in non-backward compatible Zookeeper client user code and server instance data. The following instructions provide details on how to migrate code and date from version 2.2.1 to version 3.0.0.
-</para>
-
-<para>
-Note: ZooKeeper increments the major version number (major.minor.fix) when backward incompatible changes are made to the source base. As part of the migration from SourceForge we changed the package structure (com.yahoo.zookeeper.* to org.apache.zookeeper.*) and felt it was a good time to incorporate some changes that we had been withholding. As a result the following will be required when migrating from 2.2.1 to 3.0.0 version of ZooKeeper.

-<title>Migrating Client Code</title>
-
-<para>
-  The underlying client-server protocol has changed in version 3.0.0
-  of ZooKeeper. As a result clients must be upgraded along with
-  serving clusters to ensure proper operation of the system (old
-  pre-3.0.0 clients are not guaranteed to operate against upgraded
-  3.0.0 servers and vice-versa).
-</para>
-
-<section>
-<title>Watch Management</title>
-
-<para>
-In previous releases of ZooKeeper any watches registered by clients were lost if the client lost a connection to a ZooKeeper server.
-This meant that developers had to track watches they were interested in and reregister them if a session disconnect event was recieved.
-In this release the client library tracks watches that a client has registered and reregisters the watches when a connection is made to a new server.
-Applications that still manually reregister interest should continue working properly as long as they are able to handle unsolicited watches.
-For example, an old application may register a watch for /foo and /goo, lose the connection, and reregister only /goo.
-As long as the application is able to recieve a notification for /foo, (probably ignoring it) it does not need to be changed.
-One caveat to the watch management: it is possible to miss an event for the creation and deletion of a znode if watching for creation and both the create and delete happens while the client is disconnected from ZooKeeper.
-</para>
-
-<para>
-This release also allows clients to specify call specific watch functions.
-This gives the developer the ability to modularize logic in different watch functions rather than cramming everything in the watch function attached to the ZooKeeper handle.
-Call specific watch functions receive all session events for as long as they are active, but will only receive the watch callbacks for which they are registered.
