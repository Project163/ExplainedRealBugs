-      <para>ZooKeeper has been successfully used in industrial applications.
-      It is used at Yahoo! as the coordination and failure recovery service
-      for Yahoo! Message Broker, which is a highly scalable publish-subscribe
-      system managing thousands of topics for replication and data delivery.
-      It is used by the Fetching Service for Yahoo! crawler, where it also
-      manages failure recovery. And it is used by Hadoop On Demand (HOD),
-      which is an open source implementation of the map-reduce model of
-      computation. HOD uses Zookeeper as a communications and control channel
-      between slave and master process. (For more information, see the <ulink
