code in question is basically as follows (or similar, the specific format and configuration varies somewhat):\r\n```ObjectMapper mapper = new ObjectMapper();\r\n       JodaModule jodaModule = new JodaModule();\r\n        mapper.configure(SerializationFeature.WRITE_DATES_AS_TIMESTAMPS, false);\r\n        mapper.registerModule(jodaModule);\r\n        SimpleDateFormat simpleDateFormat = new

JacksonJodaDateFormat(DateTimeFormat.forPattern(\"yy-MM-dd  'T'  HH:mm:ss \"));\r\n//        jodaModule.addSerializer(new DateTimeSerializer(jacksonJodaDateFormat,0));\r\n        System.out.println(mapper.writeValueAsString(new DateTime()));\r\n```\r\n\r\nThere's similar code for deserialization in place as well.\r\n\r\nThe intent here was to globally configure the default date format of the JSON for everything that is read/written using that ObjectMapper.\r\nThe full flexibility of JacksonJodaDateFormat was generally required, due to some custom requirements.\r\nUnless I uncomment the explicit adding of the serializer, I was not able to see a way of configuring the date format that would successfully work : the call to setDateFormat appears to do nothing.\r\nThis may have been done erroneously, however it wasn't easy to locate documentation about what the correct way to do this would have been.\r\nDo you have any suggestions?\r\nGiven that the serializer is in public scope, it wasn't obvious that this was intended to be an internal class.\r\nHowever it sounds as if there might have been a better way to do this?\r\n\r\nOne other issue is that if backwards compatibility is maintained, I would not have to go through all the libraries in our codebase that have constructed the date formats as above.\r\nIt's likely that there are quite a few other people who are (perhaps unintentionally) making use of this public class so anything that could minimise the risk of breaking binary compatibility could be useful.\r\n\r\nThanks for the explanation so far.\r\n\r\n","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-datatype-joda/issues/comments/414856269/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"andrewl102","id":3213184,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyMTMxODQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3213184?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewl102","html_url":"https://github.com/andrewl102","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewl102/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewl102/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewl102/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewl102/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewl102/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewl102/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewl102/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewl102/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewl102/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-datatype-joda/issues/comments/415119562","html_url":"https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-datatype-joda/issues/99#issuecomment-415119562","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-datatype-joda/issues/99","id":415119562,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQxNTExOTU2Mg==","user":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder","html_url":"https://github.com/cowtowncoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-08-22T17:48:23Z","updated_at":"2018-08-22T17:48:23Z","body":"@andrewl102 Just to make sure: I do not blame you or anyone for using publicly available classes.

Regardless, change itself was a bug given it broke things in a patch release, without deprecation.\r\n\r\nNow: one new mechanism that I think will and should work is \"config overrides\" , added in 2.8:\r\n\r\nhttps://medium.com/@cowtowncoder/jackson-2-8-features-5fc692887944\r\n\r\nand these will allow basically associating information equivalent to `@JsonFormat` for specific classes.\r\nSo if

something though, I don't think I can use JsonFormat on a global basis can I?\r\nI can easily due it on a per field basis but essentially we have some globally unified standards on typical date formats that could be cumbersome to annotate every time.\r\nFrom what I've seen of the code so far, I couldn't see any way of doing this without explicit registration of a custom
