issue is about the same problem as #92. However, I decided to create it because the old issue describes the problem in an indirect way, *and* because `WRITE_DATES_WITH_CONTEXT_TIME_ZONE` was added to https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind since then.)_\r\n\r\nIn version 2.18.1, `DateTime` instances are always serialized using `ObjectMapper`'s time zone (even if it was not explicitly specified - `UTC` is used in this case), rather than with `DateTime`'s own zone. Disabling the `WRITE_DATES_WITH_CONTEXT_TIME_ZONE` serialization feature (which was added for FasterXML/jackson-modules-java8#222 to address the same problem but with JSR-310 date-time types) does not help.\r\n\r\nTest code:\r\n\r\n```java\r\npackage local;\r\n\r\nimport com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.*;\r\nimport com.fasterxml.jackson.datatype.joda.JodaModule;\r\nimport org.joda.time.*;\r\n\r\npublic class App\r\n{\r\n    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception\r\n    {\r\n        DateTime dateTime = DateTime.parse(\"2024-12-01T00:00:00+02:00\");\r\n        System.out.println(\"DateTime: \" + dateTime);\r\n\r\n        ObjectMapper mapper = _objectMapper();\r\n        String json = mapper.writeValueAsString(dateTime);\r\n        System.out.println(\"Serialized: \" + json);\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    private static ObjectMapper _objectMapper()\r\n    {\r\n      ObjectMapper mapper = new ObjectMapper();\r\n      mapper.registerModule(new JodaModule());\r\n      mapper.configure(SerializationFeature.WRITE_DATES_AS_TIMESTAMPS, false);\r\n      mapper.configure(SerializationFeature.WRITE_DATES_WITH_CONTEXT_TIME_ZONE, false);\r\n      return mapper;\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nOutput:\r\n\r\n```\r\nDateTime:
