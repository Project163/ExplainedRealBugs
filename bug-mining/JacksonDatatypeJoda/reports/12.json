is due to commit df3f16c308bb82081c7a3dce0c0c878942ad1b47.\r\n\r\nCurrently, we make use heavy usage of Jackson in various project, often resulting in heterogenous versions of Jackson and jackson-datatype-joda being present in the classpath.\r\nAs a result of this commit, binary compatibility was broken which presents a compatibility issue for us.\r\nA previously valid construct call\r\n\r\n`public DateTimeSerializer(JacksonJodaDateFormat format)` is now invalid, due to the refactoring.\r\n\r\nThere is a very trivial fix that could be applied, by simply reintroducing this construct and calling the new constructor as follows:\r\n`DateTimeSerializer(format,0)`.\r\n\r\nI'm happy to  prepare a pull request if desired, though at only 1 line this appears a little redundant.\r\nIs there any possibility of making this change?\r\nTypically breaking binary compatibility in a library happens after first issuing a deprecation of the old constructor/method and/or in a major version bump, so it would be extremely helpful to maintain binary compatibility for now if possible.","closed_by":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder","html_url":"https://github.com/cowtowncoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-datatype-joda/issues/99/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-datatype-joda/issues/99/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
