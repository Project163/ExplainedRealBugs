see `RC4-SNAPSHOT` has upgraded jackson library to the latest `2.6.0` and withit comes a breaking change where previously `2015-07-28` would be perfectly serialized into a joda `DataTime` object, now any request containing Resource in this format is denied by dropwizard as `400: Bad Request`. It requires a full ISO format string like `2015-07-28T22:30:35Z`.\n\nWas this discussed previous?
