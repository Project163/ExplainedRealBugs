If it is easy enough, would it be possible to run one more test, with 2.4.6? While it is likely the problem exists (given that 2.5.3 fails, which has same fixes as 2.4.6), due to 2.4.4 causing breakage, there is a chance that fixes in 2.4.5 and 2.4.6 might be relevant. Breakage in question was related to incorrect caching of complex types like `Map`s, so it is not immediately obvious that this problem would be related. But timing does appear suspicious.\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-datatype-joda/issues/comments/100982006/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder","html_url":"https://github.com/cowtowncoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-datatype-joda/issues/comments/101134370","html_url":"https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-datatype-joda/issues/60#issuecomment-101134370","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-datatype-joda/issues/60","id":101134370,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEwMTEzNDM3MA==","user":{"login":"ThorstenPlatz","id":3687014,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2ODcwMTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3687014?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ThorstenPlatz","html_url":"https://github.com/ThorstenPlatz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ThorstenPlatz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ThorstenPlatz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ThorstenPlatz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ThorstenPlatz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ThorstenPlatz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ThorstenPlatz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ThorstenPlatz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ThorstenPlatz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ThorstenPlatz/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-05-12T05:10:37Z","updated_at":"2015-05-12T05:10:37Z","body":"Your
