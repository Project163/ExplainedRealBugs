Currently the only way to override the interpolator is by specifying a custom tween. For example, if you wanted to use interpolateHsl on an attribute, you might say:\n\n``` js\ntransition.attrTween(\"fill\", function(d, i, a) {\n  return d3.interpolateHsl(a, \"hsl(180, 50%, 50%)\");\n});\n```\n\nAn alternative might be to specify an interpolator as an additional argument to transition.attr:\n\n``` js\ntransition.attr(\"fill\", \"hsl(180, 50%, 50%)\", d3.interpolateHsl);\n```\n\nHowever, this wouldn’t work that well for transition.style, since there’s already an optional _priority_ argument (for important properties). I suppose you could do type inference on the _priority_: if it’s a function, assume that it’s an interpolator, otherwise it’s a string and there may be an optional fourth argument for the interpolator. That’s kind of icky but not horrible.\n\nAnother option might be some higher-order programming convenience functions. For each d3.interpolateFoo, we could have a d3.tweenFoo:\n\n``` js\ntransition.attrTween(\"fill\", d3.tweenHsl(\"hsl(180, 50%, 50%)\"));\n```\n\nWhere d3.tweenHsl is implemented as:\n\n``` js\nd3.tweenHsl = function(b) {\n  return function(d, i, a) {\n    return d3.interpolateHsl(a, b);\n  });\n};\n```\n\nOr even:\n\n``` js\ntransition.attrTween(\"fill\", d3.tween(d3.interpolateHsl)(\"hsl(180, 50%, 50%)\"));\n```\n\nWhere:\n\n``` js\nd3.tween = function(interpolator) {\n  return function(b) {\n    return function(d, i, a) {\n      return d3.interpolateHsl(a, b);\n    });\n  };\n};\n```\n\nThe optional argument to transition.attr and transition.style looks the most convenient, though.\n","closed_by":{"login":"mbostock","id":230541,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMDU0MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/230541?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock","html_url":"https://github.com/mbostock","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/d3/d3/issues/747/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/d3/d3/issues/747/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
