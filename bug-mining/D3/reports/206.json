to the [1:50M](http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/1edb4dd29bec26a48982/ad91bbfb001289dfcdfcbc0ba0b14ba1bcf4fe09) or [1:110M](http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/1edb4dd29bec26a48982/7adfa068b0b6b87c402b429f38929287fee5d6ca) datasets does not appear to help.\n\nHowever, and this is a little weird, pre-projecting the 50M dataset seems to produce the desired result (perhaps because it isn’t preserving polygon semantics?).\n\n[![screen shot 2014-03-22 at 10 19 11

_also_ noticed that using `--no-stitch-poles` [fixes the winding order](http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/1edb4dd29bec26a48982/1f61deac761f0543539e2ede6591922f3719958b) with the 50M dataset. However, this appears to be a coincidence as well, since this does not fix the 110M or 10M datasets. I tried using the adder branch and the preserve-polygon-semantics fix in D3, and those didn’t appear to help either but I’m not sure I tried all permutations.\n","closed_by":{"login":"mbostock","id":230541,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMDU0MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/230541?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock","html_url":"https://github.com/mbostock","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/d3/d3/issues/1802/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/d3/d3/issues/1802/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
