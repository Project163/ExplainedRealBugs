In the case of rangeBands, tick labels are offset by half the rangeBand from the value returned by the scale, as the scale returns the lower edge of the band; however in the case of rangePoints, tick labels are not offset, being positioned exactly at the value returned by the scale, and thus rangeBand must return zero.\n\nI will document this in the API reference to avoid ambiguity.

I too feel like it's important to make this information available to the user.  Because of the way padding is used to calculate the space between bands, rangeBand is not sufficient to calculate everything one might want to know about the scale.  You have to know the value of step as well.  I'm building some more complex scales with D3 and would like to be able to leverage the existing scales instead of rolling my own.  But I can't do this without
