linear.nice, you can use no arguments and get powers of ten, or specify a tick <i>count</i> and get nicing to match the corresponding tick interval. With time.nice, you must specify a time interval such as d3.time.minute, even though time.ticks allows you to specify a time range such as d3.time.minutes or a tick count.\n\nAlso, it’s odd that time.nice takes a time interval (e.g., d3.time.minute, necessary for floor and ceil) while time.ticks takes a time range function (e.g., d3.time.minutes, equivalent to interval.range).\n\nSo, I propose the following for time.ticks:\n- [x] deprecate `time.ticks(range, skip)` in favor of `time.ticks(interval, skip)`?\n- [x] deprecate `time.ticks(range)` in favor of `time.ticks(interval, skip)`?\n- [x] `time.ticks(interval, skip)` is equivalent to `time.ticks(interval.range, skip)`\n- [x] `time.ticks(interval)` is equivalent to `time.ticks(interval.range)`\n- [x] `time.ticks(count)` (existing functionality)\n- [x] `time.ticks()` is equivalent to `time.ticks(10)`\n\nAnd equivalently for time.nice:\n- [x] `time.nice(interval, skip)` is consistent with the tick interval of `time.ticks(interval, skip)`\n- [x] `time.nice(interval)` is consistent with the tick interval of `time.ticks(interval)` (existing functionality)\n- [x] `time.nice(count)` is consistent with the tick interval of `time.ticks(count)`\n- [x] `time.nice()` is equivalent to `time.nice(10)`\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/d3/d3/issues/1434/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/d3/d3/issues/1434/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":59280429,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDU5MjgwNDI5","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/d3/d3/issues/events/59280429","actor":{"login":"mbostock","id":230541,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMDU0MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/230541?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock","html_url":"https://github.com/mbostock","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"7169511d5ba758cce42d57e585bc25029a012e7e","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/d3/d3/commits/7169511d5ba758cce42d57e585bc25029a012e7e","created_at":"2013-08-02T22:05:55Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/d3/d3/issues/comments/22598767","html_url":"https://github.com/d3/d3/issues/1435#issuecomment-22598767","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/d3/d3/issues/1435","id":22598767,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIyNTk4NzY3","user":{"login":"mbostock","id":230541,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMDU0MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/230541?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock","html_url":"https://github.com/mbostock","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2013-08-13T21:23:56Z","updated_at":"2013-08-13T21:23:56Z","body":"Fixed
