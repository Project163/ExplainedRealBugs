Specifically:\n\n```\n  function tick(elapsed) {\n    if (lock.active !== id) return stop();\n\n    var t = (elapsed - delay) / duration,\n        e = ease(t),\n        n = tweened.length;\n```\n\nIf duration is zero, this causes a divide by zero, giving NaN.  It didn't happen all the time.  I'm guessing that sometimes the timing meant that the tick didn't always fire.  But when it did, bad things would happen.\n\nA simple way to make this code more robust would be: \n\n```\n    var t = (duration == 0) ? 1 : ((elapsed - delay) / duration),\n        e = ease(t),\n        n = tweened.length;\n```\n\nThis is around line 2042 or so in d3.js.\n","closed_by":{"login":"mbostock","id":230541,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMDU0MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/230541?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock","html_url":"https://github.com/mbostock","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/d3/d3/issues/493/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/d3/d3/issues/493/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
