believe the problem here is that the clipExtent in use does not contain all of the input points. Probably you’re using a standard clipExtent of [[0, 0], [960, 500]] or similar, but you have points with negative _x_ and _y_ coordinates. The clipping logic currently assumes that all of the points are contained within the clip extent.\n\nA simple fix to this would be to ignore any points outside the clip extent on input, but that wouldn’t produce the same output since a site outside the clip extent can still affect the cells within the clip extent.
