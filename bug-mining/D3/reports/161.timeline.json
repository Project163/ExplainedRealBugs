I attempted to do something using d3.map similar to the following:\n> \n> var m = d3.map();\n> m.set('key', 'value');\n> var m2 = d3.map(m);\n> m2.get('key');  // returns undefined  :(\n> I was a little perplexed until I looked at the source code. I then tried the following and got the result I was expecting:\n> \n> m2.get('\\0key');  // returns \"value\"  :)\n> I don't know why I assumed that I could make a copy of a d3 map, given another d3 map instance, but it seemed logical at the time. And I didn't even discover that it wasn't working until I tried getting the value using what I thought was the correct key. What was really perplexing to me for about 15 minutes was that because '\\0' is a non-printable character, listing the keys of m2 made it appear that 'key' was the correct key when in fact it wasn't.\n> \n> If I want to make a copy of an existing map, what's the right way to do it? I know I can do it like this...\n> \n> m.forEach( function(k,v) { m2.set(k,v) } );\n> ... but is there not a simpler way to do this? (My guess is that there isn't based upon the source code I've looked over.) If not, might you consider augmenting the d3.map() method to handle this special case when given another instance of a map? Just a suggestion. :)\n> \n> Thanks in advance!\n> \n> Paul\n> \n> —\n> Reply to this email directly or view it on GitHub.\n","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/d3/d3/issues/comments/21304585/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"HiZhaoxiaoyang","id":1161835,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNjE4MzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1161835?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HiZhaoxiaoyang","html_url":"https://github.com/HiZhaoxiaoyang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HiZhaoxiaoyang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HiZhaoxiaoyang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HiZhaoxiaoyang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HiZhaoxiaoyang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HiZhaoxiaoyang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HiZhaoxiaoyang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HiZhaoxiaoyang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HiZhaoxiaoyang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HiZhaoxiaoyang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":57402845,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDU3NDAyODQ1","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/d3/d3/issues/events/57402845","actor":{"login":"mbostock","id":230541,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMDU0MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/230541?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock","html_url":"https://github.com/mbostock","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"c14858be790686422acb6623556265ee1f0f542f","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/d3/d3/commits/c14858be790686422acb6623556265ee1f0f542f","created_at":"2013-07-21T16:55:38Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/d3/d3/issues/comments/21313069","html_url":"https://github.com/d3/d3/issues/1413#issuecomment-21313069","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/d3/d3/issues/1413","id":21313069,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIxMzEzMDY5","user":{"login":"mbostock","id":230541,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMDU0MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/230541?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock","html_url":"https://github.com/mbostock","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2013-07-21T16:56:39Z","updated_at":"2013-07-21T16:56:39Z","body":"#1414 adds a copy constructor for d3.map.

It looks like the new version doesn't behave the same as the old with respect to an array being provided as an input argument, because arrays also define a forEach method (since JavaScript 1.6/ECMAScript 5th edition).  So given the following code...\n\n```\nvar fruits = [ 'apple', 'banana', 'grape' ];\nd3.map(fruits).forEach(function(k,v){console.log(k,v)});\n```\n\nThe prior version of d3.map() will cause this to be produced...\n\n```\n0 apple\n1 banana\n2 grape\n```\n\nAnd the new version will produce this...\n\n```\napple 0\nbanana 1\ngrape 2\n```\n\nIn order to ensure backward compatibility, might you consider changing the test to the following?\n\n```\nif (object && object.forEach && object.constructor !== Array) ...\n```\n\nI did briefly test it and it seems to do the right thing.  Or perhaps there is a better way altogether (of which I'm unaware).  \n\nBTW, I'm not trying to poke holes in the implementation -- just trying to be thorough.  I hope you don't mind!\n\nPaul\n","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/d3/d3/issues/comments/21318979/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"porcus","id":1274180,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNzQxODA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1274180?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/porcus","html_url":"https://github.com/porcus","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/porcus/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/porcus/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/porcus/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/porcus/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/porcus/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/porcus/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/porcus/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/porcus/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/porcus/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/d3/d3/issues/comments/21321861","html_url":"https://github.com/d3/d3/issues/1413#issuecomment-21321861","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/d3/d3/issues/1413","id":21321861,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIxMzIxODYx","user":{"login":"mbostock","id":230541,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMDU0MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/230541?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock","html_url":"https://github.com/mbostock","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2013-07-22T02:16:01Z","updated_at":"2013-07-22T02:16:01Z","body":"That’s true, although I’m not sure it was ever my intention of supporting creating a map from an array; though I suppose since an array has enumerable properties like an object, it probably is the prudent thing to retain backwards compatibility.
