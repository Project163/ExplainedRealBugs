released d3@4.13.0 which fixes this problem for the last 4.x release (for now). But by the nature of this problem I can’t fix this for previous releases (such as 4.12.2).\r\n\r\nI’m not going to pin dependencies in the D3 submodules—that would exacerbate the problem. I do keep this repo updated regularly, but there will always be a small amount of time that passes between updating a submodule and updating this module. (A monorepo would be better here, but I wanted something that could allow separate owners for separate repos.)\r\n\r\nI suppose the answer is probably to not pin the dependencies in this repo, although that means that the `d3` version is essentially meaningless if you are using node_modules rather than the generated UMD bundle. Still, I think that’s the right thing; there’s a variant of this issue that affects ES modules loaded from unpkg, for example.\r\n\r\nThis loads d3-selection@1.2.0, d3-transition@1.1.1:\r\n\r\nhttps://unpkg.com/d3@4.12.2/index.js?module\r\n\r\nBut d3-transition@1.1.1 loads d3-selection@^1.1.0:\r\n\r\nhttps://unpkg.com/d3-transition@1.1.1/src/transition/index?module\r\nhttps://unpkg.com/d3-selection@^1.1.0?module\r\n\r\nWhich redirects to d3-selection@1.3.0:\r\n\r\nhttps://unpkg.com/d3-selection@1.3.0/index.js?module\r\n\r\nThat said, when we unpin the D3 dependencies, then loading `d3@4.x.y` is always equivalent to `d3@4` and loads the latest (v4) version of all D3 submodules, since there isn’t any code in the `d3` package itself.\r\n\r\nSince this is a fairly significant change, unpinning will be part of the 5.0 release.","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/d3/d3/issues/comments/361250655/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"mbostock","id":230541,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMDU0MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/230541?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock","html_url":"https://github.com/mbostock","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/d3/d3/issues/comments/361256992","html_url":"https://github.com/d3/d3/issues/3256#issuecomment-361256992","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/d3/d3/issues/3256","id":361256992,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM2MTI1Njk5Mg==","user":{"login":"edmorley","id":501702,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwMTcwMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/501702?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/edmorley","html_url":"https://github.com/edmorley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edmorley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edmorley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edmorley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edmorley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edmorley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edmorley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edmorley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edmorley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edmorley/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-01-29T14:12:36Z","updated_at":"2018-01-29T14:12:36Z","body":"> I’ve released d3@4.13.0 which fixes this problem for the last 4.x release (for now).

[x] [Mention](https://github.com/blog/821-mention-somebody-they-re-notified) the authors (see `Definitions by:` in `index.d.ts`) so they can respond.\r\n  - Authors: @tomwanzek @gustavderdrache @Ledragon \r\n\r\nThe release cycle for D3 Version 5 has just started with a first Release Candidate:\r\n* **d3-request** will be dropped in its entirety and replaced with **d3-fetch**,\r\n* **d3-contour** will be added, and\r\n* there is a major re-shuffle including feature deprecations between **d3-scale** and **d3-scale-chromatic** combined with the addition of **d3-scale-chromatic** to the bundle\r\n\r\nIn particular, the feature deprecation and reshuffle with regard to **d3-scale** and **d3-scale-chromatic** (see [release notes](https://github.com/d3/d3/releases/tag/v5.0.0)), imply that we need to pin down the minor versions for the latest/last D3 v4 bundle definitions.\r\n\r\nI.e. we need to add a `package.json` stub back in, so we do not break users running v4, before we add the new bundle definitions for D3 version 5.\r\n\r\n@gustavderdrache and @Ledragon any comments/thoughts re preparing for D3 v5?\r\n\r\n@andy-ms Any thoughtful guidance, how we ensure we can safely support the migration between version 4 and version 5 definitions without breaking users of v4?\r\n\r\nCheers, T\r\n\r\nRelated to #23250, #23251 and #23253.\r\n\r\n#23252 (d3-selection 1.3)

ran into something like this old issue with d3 v7 in a lerna / rollup monorepo. It might be worth recording the solution here.\r\n\r\nWe seemed to be doing everything right, with careful use of individual d3 modules and only one version of d3-selection present, but still the transition function was not mixed in. \r\n\r\nIn fact the individual module imports were the problem. We had some views where d3-selection and d3-transition were both imported, but others where we only used d3-selection. If the first import call only pulled in d3-selection then that version would be held by rollup, and any later import of d3-transition would modify a different version of selection that we never saw.\r\n\r\nThe simple solution was to create a wrapper and ensure that selection was always modified upstream:\r\n\r\n```\r\nimport { transition } from 'd3-transition';\r\nimport { select, selection } from 'd3-selection';\r\n\r\nexport {\r\n  transition,\r\n  selection,\r\n  select,\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nOur views import select and transition from this intermediate package, and all is well.\r\n\r\nThis is not a d3 problem at all but the result of our own overcomplication. All the same, @mbostock, the side-effects of transition are anomalous. Would you consider including an integrated 'selection with transition' package in a later
