this ensures that uninterpolate(a, b)(b) always equals 1, and interpolate(a, b)(1) always equals b.\n\n**uninterpolate:**\n\nThe use of a reciprocal in d3_uninterpolateNumber to avoid division\nresults in a small loss of precision (the following is a paraphrase):\n\n``` js\nfunction d3_uninterpolateNumber(a, b) {\n  var k = b - a ? 1 / (b - a) : 0;\n  return function(x) { return (x - a) * k; };\n}\n```\n\nFor x = a, there is no problem, since u = (a - a) \\* k = 0 \\* k = 0 as\nexpected.  For x = b, we have u = (b - a) \\* k, and since k cannot\nrepresent 1 / (b - a) exactly, we don’t get u = 1, but something very\nclose to 1.\n\nInstead, if we perform the division within the generated function, we\ncan ensure we always get u = 1 for x = b:\n\n``` js\nfunction d3_uninterpolateNumber(a, b) {\n  var k = b - a || Infinity;\n  return function(x) { return (x - a) / k; };\n}\n```\n\nAgain, for x = a, we simply have u = (a - a) / k = 0.  For x = b, we\nhave u = (b - a) / k = (b - a) / (b - a) = 1.\n\n**interpolate:**\n\nSimilarly, for d3_interpolateNumber, we have a small loss of precision,\nthis time due to subtraction.  Paraphrased:\n\n``` js\nfunction d3_interpolateNumber(a, b) {\n  var d = b - a;\n  return function(t) { return a + t * d; };\n}\n```\n\nThere is no issue for t = 0, because we always get i = a + 0 \\* d = a.\nHowever, for t = 1, we get i = a + d, which might not be exactly equal\nto b as desired.  The following will return precisely b for t = 1:\n\n``` js\nfunction d3_interpolateNumber(a, b) {\n  return function(t) { return a * (1 - t) + b * t; };\n}\n```\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/d3/d3/issues/2057/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/d3/d3/issues/2057/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/d3/d3/issues/comments/59470230","html_url":"https://github.com/d3/d3/issues/2039#issuecomment-59470230","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/d3/d3/issues/2039","id":59470230,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU5NDcwMjMw","user":{"login":"mbostock","id":230541,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMDU0MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/230541?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock","html_url":"https://github.com/mbostock","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-10-17T06:08:00Z","updated_at":"2014-10-17T06:08:00Z","body":"Fix
