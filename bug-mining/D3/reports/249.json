trying to add a custom namespace as attribute to the `svg` element, I get the following error: `Uncaught NamespaceError: Failed to execute 'setAttributeNS' on 'Element': 'http://www.w3.org/2000/xmlns/' is an invalid namespace for attributes.`\n\nI need to add custom namespaces to the `svg` element to create a valid SVG document that can be used to extract semantic data (e.g. [with the W3C RDFa validator](http://www.w3.org/2012/pyRdfa/Validator.html#distill_by_input))\n\nThats how I tried it:\n\n```\n// register custom namespaces\nd3.ns.prefix.ex = 'http://example.com/';\n\n// create chart\nvar chart = d3.select('#chart')\n            .append('svg:svg')\n            .attr('width', width)\n            .attr('version', '1.1')\n            .attr('xmlns', 'http://www.w3.org/2000/svg')\n            .attr('xmlns:ex', 'http://example.com/');\n```\n\nThe result should looks like this:\n\n`<svg version=\"1.1\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" xmlns:ex=\"http://example.com\">`\n","closed_by":{"login":"mbostock","id":230541,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMDU0MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/230541?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock","html_url":"https://github.com/mbostock","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/d3/d3/issues/1935/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/d3/d3/issues/1935/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
