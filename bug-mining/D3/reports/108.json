However, they have not yet been adopted outside of IE9+. (Go figure!) I don't want D3 to be a compatibility layer, but at the same time, it might be nice to bend the rules a little bit given that it should be standardized in the future.\n\nIt's fairly easy to test for native support:\n\n``` js\nvar supportsMouseenter = \"onmouseenter\" in window;\n```\n\n@shawnbot has a nice implementation in [d3-bootstrap's d3-compat.js](https://github.com/shawnbot/d3-bootstrap/blob/master/d3-compat.js). I think it needs a tweak to support removing listeners, when `callback` is null, but otherwise it looks like an elegant and useful solution. \n","closed_by":{"login":"mbostock","id":230541,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMDU0MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/230541?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock","html_url":"https://github.com/mbostock","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/d3/d3/issues/931/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/d3/d3/issues/931/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
