OK, so you could argue that because the infinite bounds proposed above are reversed, this indicates _exclusion_ of the whole universe.  But I think it would be simpler if the special meaning when bounds are reversed only applied to spherical coordinates, where modular arithmetic is in use.\n- In the case of d3.geo.bounds, ±Infinity in spherical coordinates doesn’t seem right because spherical coordinates are always between [±180°, ±90°].\n- In the case of path.bounds, it’s possible for the bounds of a non-null feature to be infinite, e.g. Mercator’s projection, so it would be nice to distinguish these cases.  Again, the argument for reversing the bounds applies here though.  Related: I suppose you could also ask whether the current clipExtent should be taken into account here when computing bounds, but I think it probably shouldn't.\n\nFor comparison, I checked d3.extent, which currently returns [undefined, undefined] for an empty array.  I suppose the equivalent for bounds might be [[NaN, NaN], [[NaN, NaN]].\n","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/d3/d3/issues/comments/15361054/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"jasondavies","id":31223,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxMjIz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/31223?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasondavies","html_url":"https://github.com/jasondavies","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasondavies/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasondavies/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasondavies/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasondavies/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasondavies/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasondavies/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasondavies/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasondavies/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasondavies/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/d3/d3/issues/comments/16249465","html_url":"https://github.com/d3/d3/issues/1154#issuecomment-16249465","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/d3/d3/issues/1154","id":16249465,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE2MjQ5NDY1","user":{"login":"jasondavies","id":31223,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxMjIz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/31223?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasondavies","html_url":"https://github.com/jasondavies","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasondavies/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasondavies/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasondavies/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasondavies/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasondavies/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasondavies/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasondavies/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasondavies/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasondavies/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2013-04-11T17:32:43Z","updated_at":"2013-04-11T17:32:43Z","body":"Remaining:\n-

behaviour of d3.geo.bounds has been modified slightly, such that the\nminimum and maximum longitudes denote minimum and maximum meridians when\ngoing from left to right in a standard equirectangular projection.\n\nIf the maximum longitude is in fact numerically smaller than the\nmeridian, this simply means that the bounds cross the antimeridian.\n\nThis fixes several issues:\n- The bounding box is now a true minimum-width bounding box.\n- Line segments that cross the antimeridian are now correctly handled.\n- Similarly, polygons that cross the antimeridian are now correctly\n  handled.\n\nSecondly, inflection points are now detected, so that the latitudinal\nrange is extended in the case where the great arc contains the great\ncircle’s inflection point.\n\nLastly, support for polygons has been improved, e.g. those that wind\naround the poles, and those that have a counter-clockwise winding order.\n\nNote that as part of the winding order detection, the performance of\nd3.geo.area had to be reduced somewhat (by as much as 25%).  This is\nbecause the trick to avoid atan2 calls fails for winding order detection\nin the case where a counter-clockwise area strays into a positive\nquadrant.  We can reinstate the trick for area-only calculations in\nfuture; I think correct winding order detection is more important at the\nmoment.\n\nSee #1154 (remaining: handling of null-like features and geometries).\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/d3/d3/issues/1231/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/d3/d3/issues/1231/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":50508720,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDUwNTA4NzIw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/d3/d3/issues/events/50508720","actor":{"login":"jasondavies","id":31223,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxMjIz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/31223?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasondavies","html_url":"https://github.com/jasondavies","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasondavies/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasondavies/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasondavies/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasondavies/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasondavies/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasondavies/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasondavies/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasondavies/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasondavies/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"14b17b3329aadd116383b2b920743d7fb20fed62","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/d3/d3/commits/14b17b3329aadd116383b2b920743d7fb20fed62","created_at":"2013-05-28T23:51:39Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"actor":{"login":"jasondavies","id":31223,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxMjIz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/31223?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasondavies","html_url":"https://github.com/jasondavies","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasondavies/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasondavies/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasondavies/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasondavies/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasondavies/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasondavies/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasondavies/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasondavies/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasondavies/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2013-05-28T23:52:20Z","updated_at":"2013-05-28T23:52:20Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/d3/d3/issues/1278","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/d3/d3","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/d3/d3/issues/1278/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/d3/d3/issues/1278/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/d3/d3/issues/1278/events","html_url":"https://github.com/d3/d3/pull/1278","id":14867569,"node_id":"MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0NTk3ODU4OQ==","number":1278,"title":"Fix
