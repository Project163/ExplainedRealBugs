Turns out that `force.start(); force.stop(); force.tick();` doesn't work cleanly.  The call to stop() sets alpha to zero, so that subsequent calls to tick() don't accomplish anything.  You can get around this by calling start(), looping over tick() a few hundred times, then calling stop(), but you still end up with at least one call to tick() from the timer (because it has to run through the method and get a false to cancel the timer).  This is a problem if you need to have a tick callback that does \"interesting\" stuff.\n\nI need a way to call start() without getting the call to resume().  Doing this cleanly will require at least one more API change.  I can see three solutions:\n\n1) Remove the call to resume() from the end of start().\nRequires that everyone update their code, so probably a non-starter.\n\n2) Add a flag/option when creating the layout or when calling start().\n\n3) Rename start() to initialize() and make a new start() that just calls initialize() and resume().\nAdding a public method might seem less clean, but on the other hand having initialize() separated from start() seems clearer to me.\n\nI was going to send you pull request for #3, but I figured you might prefer #2, or maybe something else.  Let me know if you want me to code something up.\n","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/d3/d3/issues/comments/3878408/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"krid","id":125636,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTYzNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/125636?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/krid","html_url":"https://github.com/krid","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/krid/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/krid/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/krid/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/krid/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/krid/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/krid/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/krid/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/krid/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/krid/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/d3/d3/issues/comments/4099351","html_url":"https://github.com/d3/d3/issues/419#issuecomment-4099351","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/d3/d3/issues/419","id":4099351,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQwOTkzNTE=","user":{"login":"mbostock","id":230541,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMDU0MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/230541?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock","html_url":"https://github.com/mbostock","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2012-02-22T07:08:52Z","updated_at":"2012-02-22T07:08:52Z","body":"The \"one call to tick\" was fixed in 2.7.5.

I'm interested in using d3's force layout headlessly - but with manually calling tick rather than having it run on a timer. Right now the `.alpha()` method is coupled to animation and it's not really possible to have it both ways - to have alpha set to an animating value but not have the timer firing.\n\nCould these APIs be decoupled somehow? Or is there a workaround I'm missing?
