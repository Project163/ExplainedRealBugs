This was due to the time interval coming with the data, which you can understand looking the attached screenshot.\n\n![Screenshot from 2013-03-04 11:13:28](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/885935/216098/68160280-84b4-11e2-959b-1fe00cf14781.png)\n\nDays and day numbers are not ticks, they are added by extra code. The subticks, here, should be vertical lines similar to the week major tick. In this case, there is one start tick, one end tick, and just one major tick. I discovered with the debugger that in this case, the `d3_svg_axisSubdivide` function inside `svg/axis.js` does not compute any subtick, because ticks.length is not greater then one.\n\nBefore trying to add some tests to `svg/axis-test.js` and to fix the problem, I wanted to have some comments from you.
