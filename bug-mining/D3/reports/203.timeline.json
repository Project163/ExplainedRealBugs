If you do not specify an accessor, that requires the array to be sorted in natural order. There is no way to specify reverse natural order, although you can fake it awkwardly by inverting:\n\n``` js\nvar bisect = d3.bisector(function(d) { return -d; });\nbisect.right([5, 4, 3, 2, 1], -3.5); // returns 2\n```\n\nIf d3.bisector took a comparator rather than an accessor, it would be much easier to change the behavior to support reverse order:\n\n``` js\nvar bisect = d3.bisector(d3.descending);\nbisect.right([5, 4, 3, 2, 1], 3.5); // returns 2\n```\n\nThe implementation is nearly the same:\n\n``` js\nd3.bisector = function(compare) {\n  return {\n    left: function(a, x, lo, hi) {\n      if (arguments.length < 3) lo = 0;\n      if (arguments.length < 4) hi = a.length;\n      while (lo < hi) {\n        var mid = lo + hi >>> 1;\n        if (compare(a[mid], x) < 0) lo = mid + 1;\n        else hi = mid;\n      }\n      return lo;\n    },\n    right: function(a, x, lo, hi) {\n      if (arguments.length < 3) lo = 0;\n      if (arguments.length < 4) hi = a.length;\n      while (lo < hi) {\n        var mid = lo + hi >>> 1;\n        if (compare(x, a[mid]) < 0) hi = mid;\n        else lo = mid + 1;\n      }\n      return lo;\n    }\n  };\n};\n```\n\nHowever, this change would not be backwards-compatible.

#1766. Unlike d3.bisector(accessor), this allows you to define a bisector that works in reverse order.\n\nAn awkward aspect of implementing bisection on top of a comparator is that it is often the case that the sorted array contains objects (e.g., rows from a TSV), while the search value is a primitive value (e.g., a number). Thus, you want to apply an accessor to the array elements but not to the search value.\n\nThe solution here is to invoke the comparator deterministically: the first argument is always an element from the array, and the second argument is always the search value. This lets a comparator apply an accessor to array elements but not to search values.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/d3/d3/issues/1767/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/d3/d3/issues/1767/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":99609275,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDk5NjA5Mjc1","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/d3/d3/issues/events/99609275","actor":{"login":"mbostock","id":230541,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMDU0MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/230541?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock","html_url":"https://github.com/mbostock","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"d54735b73c3de267cc535875e3a5a03d1cd9a21c","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/d3/d3/commits/d54735b73c3de267cc535875e3a5a03d1cd9a21c","created_at":"2014-03-06T18:05:17Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":102875028,"node_id":"MDE1Ok1pbGVzdG9uZWRFdmVudDEwMjg3NTAyOA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/d3/d3/issues/events/102875028","actor":{"login":"mbostock","id":230541,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMDU0MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/230541?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock","html_url":"https://github.com/mbostock","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"milestoned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2014-03-18T03:37:21Z","milestone":{"title":"3.4.x"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/d3/d3/issues/comments/38107472","html_url":"https://github.com/d3/d3/issues/1766#issuecomment-38107472","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/d3/d3/issues/1766","id":38107472,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM4MTA3NDcy","user":{"login":"mbostock","id":230541,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMDU0MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/230541?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock","html_url":"https://github.com/mbostock","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-03-19T21:12:38Z","updated_at":"2014-03-19T21:12:38Z","body":"Marking
