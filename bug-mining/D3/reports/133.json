I was using the bounds to set the projection origin, which seemed more appropriate than d3.geo.centroid because I wanted the stereographic scale variation to start from the centre of the projected bounding box.\n\nFirstly, I think we should modify d3.geo.bounds so that it returns the true longitudinal _extent_ even if λ₀ > λ₁.  The problem is shown even better if you imagine the LineString [[135, 0], [-135, 0]], which would have longitudinal bounds -135° ≤ λ ≤ 135° at the moment, which seems clearly wrong.\n\nSecondly, it’s possible for a great arc to move outside of a simplistic bounding box based on point extents, so that should be taken into account too.\n\nThis also affects d3.geo.path.bounds, which currently uses d3_geo_bounds internally.  Ideally, it should use resampling so that it properly accounts for curved arcs.\n\nRelated: it could be useful to have d3.geo.boundingCircle, similar to [ST_MinimumBoundingCircle](http://postgis.org/docs/ST_MinimumBoundingCircle.html).  This would return an origin and angular radius defining a small circle that encloses a given set of geometries.\n","closed_by":{"login":"mbostock","id":230541,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMDU0MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/230541?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock","html_url":"https://github.com/mbostock","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/d3/d3/issues/1154/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/d3/d3/issues/1154/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
