I expect it would be a pain to have two wildly divergent branches in d3.js, but maybe d3.geo.project or TopoJSON could patch in the other implementation?

Many thanks for a great library.\n\nIf I understand things correctly, there is still a mismatch between the implementation and the docs on this point.\n\nAs of v1.2.3, the [docs](https://github.com/d3/d3-geo/blob/v1.2.3/README.md#stream_lineStart) say that _\"[t]he first ring of a polygon is the exterior ring, and is typically clockwise\"_ etc. However, the [implementation](https://github.com/d3/d3-geo/blob/v1.2.3/src/stream.js) does not seem to do so. I guess @mbostock's proposed solution (updating the docs to say that order is undefined) still works.\n\nOr has this issue been fixed in some other way in d3 v4?\n","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/d3/d3/issues/comments/239896016/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"rasmuse","id":1210973,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMTA5NzM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1210973?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rasmuse","html_url":"https://github.com/rasmuse","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rasmuse/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rasmuse/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rasmuse/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rasmuse/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rasmuse/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rasmuse/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rasmuse/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rasmuse/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rasmuse/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":756066236,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50NzU2MDY2MjM2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/d3/d3/issues/events/756066236","actor":{"login":"mbostock","id":230541,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMDU0MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/230541?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock","html_url":"https://github.com/mbostock","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2016-08-15T19:03:28Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":756066237,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDc1NjA2NjIzNw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/d3/d3/issues/events/756066237","actor":{"login":"mbostock","id":230541,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMDU0MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/230541?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock","html_url":"https://github.com/mbostock","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2016-08-15T19:03:28Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/d3/d3/issues/comments/239897730","html_url":"https://github.com/d3/d3/issues/1558#issuecomment-239897730","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/d3/d3/issues/1558","id":239897730,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIzOTg5NzczMA==","user":{"login":"mbostock","id":230541,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMDU0MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/230541?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock","html_url":"https://github.com/mbostock","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-08-15T19:08:33Z","updated_at":"2016-08-15T19:09:03Z","body":"@rasmuse
