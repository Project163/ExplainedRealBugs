It's not an exception that is thrown and prevents the rest of the code from executing normally; think of it more as a warning.\n\nYour example doesn't reset the positions of the `<text>` elements after switching the scales, so you might have incorrectly attributed this to the error message in the console.\n\nStill, it would be nice to avoid setting an invalid transform.  We can replicate the existing behaviour (and that of switching between ordinal and quantitative scales) by only setting a transform if the scale returns a finite number.  Admittedly, this might look a bit strange because some exiting ticks would fade out in-place, while others would move to their positions in the new scale while fading out, but that is what the current behaviour is anyway.\n","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/d3/d3/issues/comments/51471640/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"jasondavies","id":31223,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxMjIz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/31223?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasondavies","html_url":"https://github.com/jasondavies","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasondavies/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasondavies/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasondavies/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasondavies/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasondavies/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasondavies/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasondavies/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasondavies/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasondavies/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":150265549,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDE1MDI2NTU0OQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/d3/d3/issues/events/150265549","actor":{"login":"jasondavies","id":31223,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxMjIz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/31223?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasondavies","html_url":"https://github.com/jasondavies","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasondavies/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasondavies/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasondavies/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasondavies/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasondavies/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasondavies/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasondavies/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasondavies/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasondavies/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"e89430e105a196efca72166093e4e808ece4f080","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/d3/d3/commits/e89430e105a196efca72166093e4e808ece4f080","created_at":"2014-08-07T13:48:59Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":150265573,"node_id":"MDE1Ok1pbGVzdG9uZWRFdmVudDE1MDI2NTU3Mw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/d3/d3/issues/events/150265573","actor":{"login":"jasondavies","id":31223,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxMjIz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/31223?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasondavies","html_url":"https://github.com/jasondavies","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasondavies/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasondavies/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasondavies/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasondavies/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasondavies/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasondavies/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasondavies/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasondavies/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasondavies/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"milestoned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2014-08-07T13:49:04Z","milestone":{"title":"3.4.x"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"actor":{"login":"jasondavies","id":31223,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxMjIz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/31223?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasondavies","html_url":"https://github.com/jasondavies","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasondavies/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasondavies/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasondavies/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasondavies/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasondavies/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasondavies/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasondavies/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasondavies/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasondavies/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-08-07T13:49:29Z","updated_at":"2014-08-07T13:49:29Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/d3/d3/issues/1969","repositor
