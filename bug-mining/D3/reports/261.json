sometimes renders polygons where all points are in a straight line (so no _inside_) as an \"infinite\" area with a line shaped \"hole\". The polygons are created by TileStache from a postgis database and served as topojson. The polygons start out as valid RHR geometries and are turned into lines due to the shift from floating point space to integer space; see the drawing below.\n![example](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/394323/4317788/2b755bb8-3f17-11e4-9bb7-8c7e235cba17.png)\n\nIf the order of the last three points in the topojson is changed the feature is drawn correctly. I've setup a page showing the difference here: http://research.geodan.nl/sites/vectortiling/test/faultytile.html\n\nIs there a correct clockwise order for points on a line? If so it might be that TileStache is wrong here serving the points in the wrong order, but following the above drawing the points are in a valid order. I would think that if a polygon has an area of 0, the order of points doesn't matter and D3 shouldn't try to create an infinite area with a zero area hole in it.\n","closed_by":{"login":"mbostock","id":230541,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMDU0MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/230541?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock","html_url":"https://github.com/mbostock","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/d3/d3/issues/2025/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/d3/d3/issues/2025/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
