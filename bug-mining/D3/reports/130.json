The code was:\n\n``` js\ntiles.transition().delay(TRANSITION_DELAY).duration(TRANSITION_DURATION).attr(\"opacity\", 1)\n```\n\nThe workaround I found was to style the opacity instead of using the opacity attr:\n\n``` css\n.tile { opacity: 0; }\n```\n\n``` js\ntiles.transition().delay(TRANSITION_DELAY).duration(TRANSITION_DURATION).style(\"opacity\", 1)\n```\n\nNote that in the previous version of the code, there was no need to initialize the opacity to 0.\n\nI was led to this workaround by this post from mbostock:\nhttps://groups.google.com/d/msg/d3-js/hRlz9hndpmA/BH89BQIRCp4J\n\nI guess my concern is that this was an inadvertent change, may cause other issues, and may require further changes to our code. Is this a known issue and/or intentional change? If so, is my workaround the correct approach now?\n","closed_by":{"login":"mbostock","id":230541,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMDU0MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/230541?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock","html_url":"https://github.com/mbostock","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/d3/d3/issues/1247/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/d3/d3/issues/1247/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
