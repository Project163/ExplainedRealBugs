The reason is that during subsequent time the old event handlers are still registered but [touchposition](https://github.com/mbostock/d3/blob/25630484b8f895737e8a781ffe3fb850ace8ef8b/src/behavior/drag.js#L25) doesn't find a matching touch. So the dx/dy variables assignments in [move](https://github.com/mbostock/d3/blob/25630484b8f895737e8a781ffe3fb850ace8ef8b/src/behavior/drag.js#L53) attempt to index undefined instead of the expected 2-element array. (The root cause is that touch events are all supposed to be dispatched to the original element, regardless of whether it remains with its original ancestors. See http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-webevents/2012OctDec/0023.html for a bit more discussion of this troublesome standard behavior.)\n\nI tried checking `if (!p) return ended();` which kind of avoided the problem but left the drag events firing in a lousy order. Personally I'm not super excited with the current drag implementation overall (most notably its handling for multiple fingers is broken in general; I'm thinking of trying an approach more along the lines of a [Pointer Events](http://www.w3.org/TR/pointerevents/) wrapper/simulator instead that would be useful for e.g. cross-platform zoom too) and in my case it was better to **workaround with `sel.style('display', \"none\")`** on dragstart/drag, removing on dragend, than prematurely end the first drag anyway.\n\nNote that any fix might also be relevant to the zoom stuff and/or `d3.svg.brush` — haven't reviewed or tested but it looks like especially the latter does its own handling (why isn't it using d3.behavior drag?)\n","closed_by":{"login":"mbostock","id":230541,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMDU0MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/230541?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock","html_url":"https://github.com/mbostock","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/d3/d3/issues/1786/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/d3/d3/issues/1786/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
