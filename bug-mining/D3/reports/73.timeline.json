are generally supposed to be stateless; they are high-level functions that you use to transform (pre-process) data. But the chord layout is different in that it is bound to a specific dataset, rather than a reusable function.\n\nThe reason for this is that a layout may have multiple inputs and multiple outputs, which makes the standard approach of a function with one input and one output more difficult to use. The chord layout takes a matrix as input but returns a set of chords and groups.\n\nI'm not sure there's any strong need to change the design of these layouts. There's no strict convention about how layouts are designed. Perhaps doing anything else would just make them harder to use. But I'm filing this issue to track this potential design issue.\n\nEdit: This issue previously also considered the statefulness of the force layout. However, I think this is appropriate as the force layout continues to run interactively, and you need a way to control it.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/d3/d3/issues/358/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/d3/d3/issues/358/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/d3/d3/issues/comments/4097535","html_url":"https://github.com/d3/d3/issues/434#issuecomment-4097535","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/d3/d3/issues/434","id":4097535,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQwOTc1MzU=","user":{"login":"mbostock","id":230541,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMDU0MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/230541?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock","html_url":"https://github.com/mbostock","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2012-02-22T03:36:34Z","updated_at":"2012-02-22T03:36:42Z","body":"I believe this is already the case, unless you specify sortChords, which is intended.
