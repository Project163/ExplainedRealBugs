For example, if you have a data object that is used to create element attributes of the same name, then interpolating the data or transitioning the element should behave the same way.\n\nThis was more important in the past when d3_interpolateByName was used to detect colors for interpolation:\n\n``` js\nvar d3_interpolate_number = /[-+]?(?:\\d+\\.\\d+|\\d+\\.|\\.\\d+|\\d+)(?:[eE][-]?\\d+)?/g,\n    d3_interpolate_rgb = {background: 1, fill: 1, stroke: 1};\n\nfunction d3_interpolateByName(n) {\n  return n in d3_interpolate_rgb || /\\bcolor\\b/.test(n)\n      ? d3.interpolateRgb\n      : d3.interpolate;\n}\n```\n\nHowever, with commit 92d15a447204db43e9b0c61c97a71d1c15e1680c, the behavior of d3.interpolate changed so that it could detect colors by value, rather than by name. Hence it became possible to construct a linear scale and get RGB interpolation without needing to specify d3.interpolateRgb as the interpolator explicitly.\n\nSometime later, it was noticed by d3_interpolateByName was no longer needed since colors were detected by value, and it was removed in 6fe70a81d4bc394ac32a48f77d8010d4e4b7f2e7. However, when we added transform interpolation, we needed a way to detect when transforms were being used, so we restored d3_interpolateByName in a7ff9fa6e5ac50c9d0a96424220bbd9e974f0763.\n\nI guess the worked in the past because the transform style was always vendor prefixed (e.g., \"-webkit-transform\" or \"webkitTransform\"), and so it was only in SVG that the transform attribute is not prefixed.\n\nYour proposal of checking name.space wouldn’t really work because the \"transform\" attribute is not namespaced. The only namespaced attribute you are likely to see is \"xlink:href\". Although the \"transform\" attribute is defined in the SVG namespace, the namespace is not specified because it is applied to SVG elements. So you’d need to do something convoluted, and on a per-element basis!, to detect whether the name \"transform\" referred to an SVG transform in particular.\n\nPerhaps it would be better to detect transforms by value rather than by name, similar to how we detect colors. But it should be fast, because d3.interpolate is fairly widely used.\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/d3/d3/issues/comments/19573011/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"mbostock","id":230541,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMDU0MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/230541?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock","html_url":"https://github.com/mbostock","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/d3/d3/issues/comments/19576347","html_url":"https://github.com/d3/d3/issues/1323#issuecomment-19576347","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/d3/d3/issues/1323","id":19576347,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE5NTc2MzQ3","user":{"login":"jasondavies","id":31223,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxMjIz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/31223?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasondavies","html_url":"https://github.com/jasondavies","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasondavies/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasondavies/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasondavies/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasondavies/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasondavies/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasondavies/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasondavies/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasondavies/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasondavies/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2013-06-17T21:31:18Z","updated_at":"2013-06-17T21:31:18Z","body":"Thanks, that makes sense.

Supporting units and especially 3D transform interpolation adds a lot of complexity.\n\nRelated: it might be nice to use D3 transitions to trigger CSS3 transitions for styles, using the same transition.style syntax. I assume that we could do this simply by changing the implementation of transition.style, although it’s likely that CSS3 transitions don’t exactly support every feature of D3 transitions.\n\nIt looks like it would be possible to restrict d3.interpolateTransform to only valid (SVG) transforms. In that case, the result of `g.transform.baseVal.consolidate()` is null. (Note: this includes the null transform, whereas an identity transform such as scale(1) is still considered valid. We could check specifically for null before validating the transform, though.) So, we could remove d3_interpolateByName, then have a two-level check to detect whether the target value is a transform: first using the isMaybeTransform regular expression, and then the more accurate d3.transform constructor.\n\nHowever, even if we did this, I’m not sure that transition.style(\"transform\", …) would work. Because it would fallback to string interpolation, and the whole reason we implemented transform interpolation is that browsers munge the transform value so it differs from what was set by the user, and then naïve string interpolation does not produce the desired result. This is certainly true of CSS3 transforms:\n\n``` js\ndiv.style(\"-webkit-transform\", \"translate(1px,1px)\");\ndiv.style(\"-webkit-transform\"); // matrix(1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1)\n```\n\nThus, while detecting invalid SVG transforms is a good idea, it’s insufficient to solve this problem. Well, I suppose if browsers always convert transforms to a single matrix, then string interpolation will do _something_ but probably not the expected behavior.\n\nWe either need to implement pure-JavaScript interpolation for CSS3 transforms as well (which I’ve argued is probably not worth the effort), or we need to get users to use CSS3 transitions for CSS3 transforms. It would be ideal if D3 did this automatically for transition.style, but I’m not sure this is possible.

scenario.\n","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/d3/d3/issues/comments/20069586/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"jasondavies","id":31223,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxMjIz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/31223?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasondavies","html_url":"https://github.com/jasondavies","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasondavies/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasondavies/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasondavies/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasondavies/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasondavies/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasondavies/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasondavies/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasondavies/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasondavies/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":54614439,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDU0NjE0NDM5","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/d3/d3/issues/events/54614439","actor":{"login":"mbostock","id":230541,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMDU0MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/230541?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock","html_url":"https://github.com/mbostock","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"a8f2ac2aa451d8a2bdf41ed78a65aeeb3e0d1adf","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/d3/d3/commits/a8f2ac2aa451d8a2bdf41ed78a65aeeb3e0d1adf","created_at":"2013-06-28T22:42:04Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"actor":{"login":"mbostock","id":230541,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMDU0MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/230541?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock","html_url":"https://github.com/mbostock","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2013-06-28T22:42:16Z","updated_at":"2013-06-28T22:42:16Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/d3/d3/issues/1347","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/d3/d3","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/d3/d3/issues/1347/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/d3/d3/issues/1347/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/d3/d3/issues/1347/events","html_url":"https://github.com/d3/d3/pull/1347","id":16165715,"node_id":"MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0NjYyOTUxNw==","number":1347,"title":"Limit

transform interpolator is designed for SVG transforms; unlike CSS3 transforms, SVG transforms do not have units and are limited to 2D. This commit limits transform interpolation to transition.attr, so that it only applies to SVG transforms and not CSS3 transforms which are assigned via style. Thus, if transition.style is used to interpolate the transform style, the default string interpolator will now be used.\n\nNote that string interpolation of CSS3 transforms is still likely to break; you should use CSS3 transitions instead.

I’ve created a pull request which limits the special transform interpolator to transition.attr, so that it won’t apply to transition.style. This means that it also won’t apply to d3.interpolateObject, but I think in that case it’s ambiguous whether the transform is a CSS or an SVG transform, and until we support both it don’t make sense to assume it’s an SVG transform.\n\nIt would be slightly cleaner to detect transforms by value rather than by name, but this is easier and it restricts the special behavior, which is good.
