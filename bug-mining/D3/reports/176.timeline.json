 The problem is that IE9 doesn’t support prototype injection, so we use direct extension instead.  However, this assumes that all methods are already on the prototype object at the time of subclassing, which unfortunately is not the case for `d3_selectionRoot` as it is defined at the end of `selection/selection.js`, which is expanded before `selection/transition.js`.\n\nThere is a similar problem for `d3_selectionPrototype.on` and `d3_selectionPrototype.interrupt`, which are declared after `d3_selectionRoot` is defined, if you look at the SMASHed file.\n\nPerhaps `d3.selection` should be modified to use lazy initialisation, rather than eagerly initialising `d3_selectionRoot`.

is available, the corresponding code will crash; however, the rest of D3 will work just fine. For example, you can’t use d3.select(string) unless a global document is available; it just doesn’t make sense. Use d3.select(node) instead, followed by selection.select(string).\n\nCode that previously checked for a global on the window (e.g., XDomainRequest) now uses the global context (`this`) rather than the
