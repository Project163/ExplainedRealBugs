For example:\n\n``` js\nvar x = d3.scale.linear().domain([0, 10]);\nx.ticks(10); // [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]\n```\n\nSo, scale.nice seems to already be the second option you are describing?\n\nAs for the first, I'd probably concat the scale.ticks with the scale.domain in conjunction with axis.tickValues. This would combine the scale ticks and the upper and lower bounds of the domain, thus achieving the desired effect.\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/d3/d3/issues/comments/13850598/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"mbostock","id":230541,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMDU0MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/230541?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock","html_url":"https://github.com/mbostock","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/d3/d3/issues/comments/13850927","html_url":"https://github.com/d3/d3/issues/1088#issuecomment-13850927","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/d3/d3/issues/1088","id":13850927,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEzODUwOTI3","user":{"login":"ansman","id":102883,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMjg4Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/102883?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ansman","html_url":"https://github.com/ansman","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ansman/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ansman/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ansman/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ansman/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ansman/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ansman/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ansman/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ansman/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ansman/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2013-02-20T19:23:39Z","updated_at":"2013-02-20T19:24:56Z","body":"Not
