D3 version is 3.4.6.\n\nThe problem seems to occur when I start panning my layout with the first touch being over a node. When I add a second finger outside of the node (but inside the svg) and let go of the first touch, the zoom behavior stops working (except for doubletap zoom). The only way to get the zoom behavior back, is by starting it on the initial node, or manualy readding the svg.on('zoom', zoom).\n\nI think the problem is caused by the last touch event not having the same target as the initial touch.\nI've read some suggestions where pointer event are captured by an overlay to make sure everything has the same target, however I need my nodes to be clickable. \n\nUsing zoomstart and zoomend events to dynamically add an overlay doesn't seem to work because the overlay gets added at the first touch, so my nodes still aren't clickable.\n\nI managed to replicate the error in the above example, by pressing on the root node, placing my 2nd finger to the left of the graph and lifting my first finger.\n","closed_by":{"login":"mbostock","id":230541,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMDU0MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/230541?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock","html_url":"https://github.com/mbostock","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/d3/d3/issues/1850/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/d3/d3/issues/1850/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
