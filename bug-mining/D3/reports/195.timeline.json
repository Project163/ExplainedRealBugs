we were generating points along the antimeridian at λ=±180°\nwhen clipping.  Strictly speaking, on a sphere, -180° is the same\nlongitude as +180°.  Internally, we can distinguish these “coincident”\npoints and preserve the longitude’s sign when converting to and from\nCartesian coordinates by assuming that atan2(sin(±π), x<0)=±π.\n\nUp until now, this has worked, probably due to floating point roundoff\nin Math.PI meaning that abs(λ) < π, and hence sin(±Math.PI) is a very\nsmall non-zero number, effectively preserving the sign of the longitude.\n\nIt seems Chrome Canary has added some minor approximations, which\nimprove performance but bring to light our reliance on this behaviour,\nsince sin(+Math.PI) = sin(-Math.PI) = +0.  Strictly speaking, I think\nChrome should return -0 for sin(-Math.PI), but we probably shouldn’t\nrely on it, as it’s not in ECMAScript.\n\nI had already made a minor modification to avoid generating these\n“coincident” points in the clip-polygon branch.  I decided longitudes\nshould be in the range [-180°, +180°), and thus points were output with\nlongitudes -π and π - ε.  This was required to fix various issues with\nhandling of coincident points elsewhere.\n\nIn Chrome, this modification doesn’t actually fix the problem, because\natan2(sin(-π), x)=π where x<0, so λ=-180° becomes λ=+180° when\nresampling.  Instead, the range (-180, +180°] does in fact fix the\nissue, using λ=ε-π and λ=π.  As I mentioned above, it would be nice if\nChrome’s implementation gave atan2(sin(-Math.PI), x<0)=-Math.PI.\n\nFor good measure, I’ve enforced this in d3.geo.rotation too, ensuring\nthat input points with λ<ε-π become λ=+π.\n\nWe could go further and output points at abs(λ)=π-ε, but it seems\nunnecessary as the above already preserves the longitude’s sign.\n\nNote: I haven’t updated any tests for this change.\n\nFixes #1635.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/d3/d3/issues/1638/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/d3/d3/issues/1638/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"actor":{"login":"drewda","id":212369,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMjM2OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/212369?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/drewda","html_url":"https://github.com/drewda","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drewda/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drewda/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drewda/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drewda/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drewda/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drewda/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drewda/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drewda/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drewda/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2013-11-18T15:20:39Z","updated_at":"2013-11-18T15:20:39Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openstreetmap/openstreetmap-website/issues/532","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openstreetmap/openstreetmap-website","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openstreetmap/openstreetmap-website/issues/532/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openstreetmap/openstreetmap-website/issues/532/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openstreetmap/openstreetmap-website/issues/532/events","html_url":"https://github.com/openstreetmap/openstreetmap-website/issues/532","id":22752077,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWUyMjc1MjA3Nw==","number":532,"title":"user
