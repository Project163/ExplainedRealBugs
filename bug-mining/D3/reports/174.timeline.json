thanks. I will do my own math.  I am creating a library for a javascript-based viewshed analysis tool that I am intending on using for point to point wireless link planning.  The reason I was using the circle function in my particular situation is just because I thought I would be clever and use it as the points of a circular grid.  Think of it kind of like the tiles on a dartboard, but stretched over the earth.  The number of points I get will vary depending on the resolution.  I then get the centroid of each polygon I make and run a line of site link analysis on it.  So that being said, if the number of points vary, I cannot make the little polygons that I will color to display if the link is good or not... at least using solely the circle function.  If you have any easy ways of doing this, let me know.  I think I have some ideas, but they are not elegant per se.  \n\nI'll be happy share anything if you're ever interested in that kind of stuff!
