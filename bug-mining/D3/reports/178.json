As this is happening with the example at http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/3892919, I believe it may be an issue in d3 itself. \n\nI'm guessing d3 can see that there are two touch points, but can only access/use the one within its svg (hence the `'undefined' is not an object` error). \n\nI think the correct behaviour here would be for d3 to ignore touch points outside of the svg. Unfortunately I'm new to d3, so don't yet have the knowledge to patch it myself (if indeed it is an issue with d3, and not my own code!). \n\nDoes anyone have any thoughts on this?\n","closed_by":{"login":"jasondavies","id":31223,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxMjIz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/31223?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasondavies","html_url":"https://github.com/jasondavies","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasondavies/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasondavies/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasondavies/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasondavies/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasondavies/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasondavies/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasondavies/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasondavies/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasondavies/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/d3/d3/issues/1497/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/d3/d3/issues/1497/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
