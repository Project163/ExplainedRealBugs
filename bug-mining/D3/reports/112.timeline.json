From MDC:\n\n> A for...in loop iterates over the properties of an object in an arbitrary order (see the delete operator for more on why one cannot depend on the seeming orderliness of iteration, at least in a cross-browser setting).\n\nAnother reason why this is dangerous is that some objects may not have every key defined.\n\nI think you could fix these problems with a two-pass approach. First, you'd iterate over the keys of every object, creating the union of all keys. The order of the keys would likely be arbitrary, but you could at least make it match the iteration order in the case where all of the objects have all of the keys defined. Then, you'd iterate over all the objects again, and extract the values. I suppose this would also mean mapping null and undefined values to the empty string (though you could map these to \"null\" and \"undefined\", and only generate the empty string if the given property is missing via `in`).\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/d3/d3/issues/comments/4004458/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"mbostock","id":230541,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMDU0MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/230541?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock","html_url":"https://github.com/mbostock","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":9677207,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDk2NzcyMDc=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/d3/d3/issues/events/9677207","actor":{"login":"mbostock","id":230541,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMDU0MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/230541?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock","html_url":"https://github.com/mbostock","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2012-02-16T16:52:33Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/d3/d3/issues/comments/6860446","html_url":"https://github.com/d3/d3/issues/509#issuecomment-6860446","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/d3/d3/issues/509","id":6860446,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY4NjA0NDY=","user":{"login":"idibidiart","id":1288823,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyODg4MjM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1288823?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/idibidiart","html_url":"https://github.com/idibidiart","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/idibidiart/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/idibidiart/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/idibidiart/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/idibidiart/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/idibidiart/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/idibidiart/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/idibidiart/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/idibidiart/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/idibidiart/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2012-07-09T21:35:20Z","updated_at":"2012-07-09T21:35:20Z","body":"How
