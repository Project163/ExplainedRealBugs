You will notice that when D3 v3.2.7 is used, the circle isn't reset to its initial position. However when v3.1.6 is used, the circle position is reset.\n\nIf you open console you will notice that logs for v3.1.6 look like:\n\n```\nstep, (...), step, Click!\n```\n\nwhile when v3.2.7 is used:\n\n```\nstep, (...), step, Click!, step\n```\n\nAfter starting a new transition (whose main goal is just to cancel previous one), there is one more step of old transition executed. Small thing, but it's enough to break existing apps. This single step sets \"cx\" attribute back to some value between 50 and 450.\n\nOf course I know that previous behavior wasn't specified and guaranteed at all (was I \"lucky\" that it worked? ;)). Also the way I cancel transitions is a bit icky (however, is there any better approach? I guess this one was recommended on mailing list). So if I can fix this problem on my side, I'm happy to do it. If not, it would be great if the previous behavior is restored.\n","closed_by":{"login":"mbostock","id":230541,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMDU0MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/230541?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock","html_url":"https://github.com/mbostock","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/d3/d3/issues/1410/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/d3/d3/issues/1410/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
