We're using his version with some tweaks on [our latest twitter tracker](http://vgatwittertracker.spike.com/live/#buzz), which works nearly flawlessly on IE8.\n\nWhile it's great that d3 is enabling lots of really interesting stuff on the cutting edge of web technology, I think it'd be almost as equally awesome to make the core stuff (e.g. node selection, data binding, parametric attribute and styles) available to a broader spectrum of browsers just by adding a couple of polyfills (which we could even include in the source and/or
