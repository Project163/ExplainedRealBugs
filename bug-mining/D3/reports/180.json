It did include [a jsFiddle that demonstates the problem](http://jsfiddle.net/SGyQN/).\n\nThe heart of the problem, from what I can tell, is that although javascript Date objects have resolution down to the millisecond, their representation often doesn't include this.  So far, the solution I've found that solves this best is to modify the d3_identity function and add an exception for Date:\n\n``` javascript\nfunction d3_identity(d) {\n    if (d instanceof Date) {\n        return d.getTime();\n    }\n    return d;\n}\n```\n\nMy worry is that this might be a special snowflake, and an incorrect way of solving the problem.  I was hoping to get some feedback regarding this solution, or where I should head in the source to produce a more elegant solution.\n","closed_by":{"login":"mbostock","id":230541,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMDU0MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/230541?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock","html_url":"https://github.com/mbostock","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/d3/d3/issues/1529/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/d3/d3/issues/1529/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
