The issue is here:\n\n``` javascript\n.style(\"width\", function(d) { return d.dx - 1 + \"px\"; })\n.style(\"height\", function(d) { return d.dy - 1 + \"px\"; });\n```\n\nThis results in negative values when either d.dx or d.dy is zero.  The -1 is there to make the borders look nice, but you can keep it with this simple fix:\n\n``` javascript\n.style(\"width\", function(d) { return Math.max(0, d.dx - 1) + \"px\"; })\n.style(\"height\", function(d) { return Math.max(0, d.dy - 1) + \"px\"; });\n```\n\nAlternatively, you can set `.padding(1)` on the treemap layout itself, and you would no longer need to subtract 1 from the width and height.  However, this would result in a separation of 2px rather than 1px.  In plain CSS you can't use subpixel positioning, but in SVG you could use `.padding(.5)` to achieve the same result.\n","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/d3/d3/issues/comments/3928239/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"jasondavies","id":31223,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxMjIz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/31223?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasondavies","html_url":"https://github.com/jasondavies","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasondavies/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasondavies/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasondavies/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasondavies/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasondavies/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasondavies/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasondavies/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasondavies/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasondavies/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":9402986,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDk0MDI5ODY=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/d3/d3/issues/events/9402986","actor":{"login":"jasondavies","id":31223,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxMjIz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/31223?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasondavies","html_url":"https://github.com/jasondavies","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasondavies/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasondavies/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasondavies/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasondavies/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasondavies/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasondavies/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasondavies/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasondavies/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasondavies/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2012-02-12T15:00:46Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/d3/d3/issues/comments/3928263","html_url":"https://github.com/d3/d3/issues/498#issuecomment-3928263","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/d3/d3/issues/498","id":3928263,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM5MjgyNjM=","user":{"login":"jasondavies","id":31223,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxMjIz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/31223?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasondavies","html_url":"https://github.com/jasondavies","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasondavies/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasondavies/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasondavies/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasondavies/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasondavies/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasondavies/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasondavies/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasondavies/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasondavies/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2012-02-12T15:03:19Z","updated_at":"2012-02-12T15:03:19Z","body":"And
