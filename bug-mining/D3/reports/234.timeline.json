this contrived example:\n\n``` js\nd3.transition().each(function() {\n  d3.selectAll([null, document.body]).transition(); // creates the transition\n  d3.selectAll([document.body, null]).transition().each(\"start\", function(d, i) {\n    console.log(\"start\", i); // start, 1\n  });\n});\n```\n\nNormally, we would expect the value of `i` in the start event callback to be 0 because the only non-null element in the selection is at index 0.\n\nHowever, because this transition was created within the context of a transition.each callback, and because a transition with the same inherited id was already created on that element by the previous line of code, _and_ because said transition was created with a selection with a different order of elements, the reported `i` is instead 1.\n\nIt would probably be cleaner to capture the index when registering the event listeners and tweens, and eliminate the index captured by `d3_transitionNode`.
