This is a little bit slower than it needs to be because the brush is doing extra work for every tick of the transition (e.g., removing the display style every time), but I suspect it would be easy to optimize.\n\nBut I also made an initial implementation in the [brush-transition branch](/mbostock/d3/tree/brush-transition), following the pattern set by the axis component. To transition a brush, you simply set the new brush extent and then call the brush on a transition. For example:\n\n``` js\ng.transition()\n    .call(brush.extent(newExtent));\n```\n\nHowever, while this transitions the _display_ of the brush, it doesn’t transition the _state_ of the brush (the brush’s extent), nor does it automatically trigger \"brush\" events while the transition moves the brush. You can workaround this issue, but it’s somewhat cumbersome:\n\n``` js\nvar extent = brush.extent();\ng.transition()\n    .call(brush.extent(newExtent))\n    .tween(\"brush\", function() {\n      var i = d3.interpolate(extent, newExtent);\n      return function(t) { brush.extent(i(t)); brushed(); };\n    });\n```\n\n(Here `brushed` is the \"brush\" event listener.)\n\nI have to think a little more about what the right pattern should be. A brush is different from an axis in that the brush has state—the extent—which you can listen to. When an axis transitions, we don’t typically interpolate the scale domains in data-space; instead the displayed elements’ attributes are interpolated.\n\nAlso, there’s an interesting question as to what happens if the user tries to brush while the brush is transitioning. Presumably it should interrupt the transition (#1448), at least by default. If desired, the user could temporarily disable pointer-events if they wanted the transition to be uninterruptible.\n\nA related issue is that setting the brush extent does not currently trigger a redraw or an event. Instead the caller is expected to redraw and notify any listeners as appropriate. We should consider if it might be more appropriate for setting the extent programmatically to trigger a \"brush\" event (but not a redraw, since the brush does not have a reference to its display elements); after all, in a loosely-coupled system based on events, someone setting the extent of a brush won’t necessarily have references to all of the brush’s listeners, and thus cannot notify them directly. But I need to think through whether changing this behavior will cause other problems.\n\nAnother possibility is that setting the brush extent does not trigger the \"brush\" event until the brush is drawn. This would allow the brush to interpolate the extent during the transition, pulling the old extent from `this.__chart__`, similar to how the axis squirrels away the copies of the old scale so that it can transition entering ticks. I think this could also make a cleaner design, since it would guarantee that whatever display changes a brush event listener makes, will get applied whenever the brush is redrawn. For example, when the brush is initially drawn, you wouldn’t have to trigger your `brushed` event listener manually.\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/d3/d3/issues/comments/22453839/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"mbostock","id":230541,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMDU0MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/230541?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock","html_url":"https://github.com/mbostock","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/d3/d3/issues/comments/22461717","html_url":"https://github.com/d3/d3/issues/1385#issuecomment-22461717","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/d3/d3/issues/1385","id":22461717,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIyNDYxNzE3","user":{"login":"mbostock","id":230541,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMDU0MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/230541?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock","html_url":"https://github.com/mbostock","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2013-08-11T17:42:23Z","updated_at":"2013-08-11T17:47:16Z","body":"An analogous component to the brush is the zoom behavior: it has state (scale & translate) that is modified in response to user interaction, dispatching events. It’s interesting to consider whether the zoom behavior could support transitions, and not just [with custom tweens](http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/3892928). If you could change the state of the zoom behavior using a transition, it could automatically dispatch zoomstart, zoom and zoomend events (#1451), and even use a [smooth zooming interpolator](http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/3828981)!\n\nYet unlike the brush, the zoom behavior does not display its state directly in the DOM, so there’s not normally a need to apply the zoom behavior via selection.call when its state changes. I mean, you could, but normally you only apply the behavior once to register its listeners. So if you use transition.call to transition the zoom behavior’s state, then presumably you’d use selection.call to make instantaneous changes, in contrast to the current API where you can just set the state directly.\n\nBut maybe this could work… even be backwards-compatible. Setting the state of the zoom behavior (e.g., calling zoom.scale) wouldn’t trigger an event, but subsequently re-applying the zoom behavior via selection.call would. So if you wanted to set the state of the zoom behavior programmatically, you would use selection.call to notify the listeners rather than invoking them directly. Before:\n\n``` js\nzoom.scale(newScale);\nzoomed();\n```\n\nAfter:\n\n``` js\nsvg.call(zoom.scale(newScale));\n```\n\nOr the more verbose equivalent to demonstrate what’s happening:\n\n``` js\nzoom.scale(newScale); // sets state, but doesn’t notify\nsvg.call(zoom); // notifies\n```\n\nAnd so then if you wanted to transition the zoom behavior, the only difference would be the transition:\n\n``` js\nsvg.transition().call(zoom.scale(newScale));\n```\n\n(The zoom behavior would need to store the last-displayed scale and translate in `element.__chart__`. And it’s not clear whether you could support transitions where the bound scales change, but you could definitely support transitions on the transform.)\n\nSo, now there are two copies of the component’s state: the “in-memory” state that was set programmatically, and the component’s displayed state. You can set the in-memory state and query it using today’s API. But if we also track the displayed state, then the component can perform a transition and dispatch events which report the _displayed_ state as well. For example, the “brush” event would specify the displayed extent, which could lag behind the set `brush.extent()` while transitioning.\n\nThe “zoom” event already includes the transform (scale factor and translate offset). However, since the zoom behavior also supports changing the bound scales’ domains automatically, it would not be sufficient to only include the transform in the event, since whoever is listening for zoom events will probably want to use the bound scales, not the transform. I suppose the “zoom” event could include a copy of the bound scales with the domain modified, but that’s also weird in the client because it would have to refer to these special copies during zoom events.\n\nSo… maybe that wouldn’t work exactly, but maybe there’s something similar that would.\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/d3/d3/issues/comments/22461717/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"mbostock","id":230541,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMDU0MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/230541?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock","html_url":"https://github.com/mbostock","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/d3/d3/issues/comments/22462015","html_url":"https://github.com/d3/d3/issues/1385#issuecomment-22462015","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/d3/d3/issues/1385","id":22462015,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIyNDYyMDE1","user":{"login":"mbostock","id":230541,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMDU0MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/230541?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock","html_url":"https://github.com/mbostock","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2013-08-11T18:01:45Z","updated_at":"2013-08-11T18:01:45Z","body":"Perhaps instead of “set” and “displayed” state, we could have the “set” and “reported” state. It’s a similar idea except rather than squirreling the state in `element.__chart__`, the last-reported state would be stored internally by the component. Then if a transition is triggered (still by transition.call), the component temporarily reverts to its last-reported state, before transitioning to the set state. And thus the zoom behavior can modify the domains of its bound scales during the transition without duplicating them.\n\nI suppose the axis component could also use this technique, rather than storing the old scale in `element.__chart__`. But this would preclude reusing a single axis component to render multiple axes with different scales (or domains) and still transition correctly, since the axis component could only track a single last-reported state, not the displayed state of the current element. For example, if you have [small multiples](http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/1157787) with varying domains, you would need to instantiate a unique axis component for each multiple to transition correctly; currently you only need to set the scale’s domain before rendering that multiple.\n\nBut the axis component is different because it doesn’t have queryable state like the brush or zoom behavior. So I think it could be reasonable to have the brush and zoom behavior track their reported state internally, and not enable instancing like the axis component.\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/d3/d3/issues/comments/22462015/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"mbostock","id":230541,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMDU0MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/230541?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock","html_url":"https://github.com/mbostock","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/d3/d3/issues/comments/22528005","html_url":"https://github.com/d3/d3/issues/1385#issuecomment-22528005","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/d3/d3/issues/1385","id":22528005,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIyNTI4MDA1","user":{"login":"mbostock","id":230541,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMDU0MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/230541?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock","html_url":"https://github.com/mbostock","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2013-08-12T21:40:47Z","updated_at":"2013-08-12T21:40:47Z","body":"Here’s an example of the new approach: http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/2dba4bdf7b4147ae298b\n\nSeems like it works pretty well.
