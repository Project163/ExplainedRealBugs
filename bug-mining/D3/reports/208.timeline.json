an axis with the following ticks:\n    [-0.6000000000000001, -0.4000000000000001, -0.2000000000000001,   -8.881784197001253e-17, 0.1999999999999999, 0.3999999999999999, 0.5999999999999999, 0.7999999999999999, 1, 1.2, 1.4, 1.6, 1.8, 2]\n\nI want to format them using SI-prefix formatting (to handle possible large numbers), so I use the formatter d3.format(\".3s\").\n\nUnfortunately, the tiny-zero representation results in the following tick labels being generated: \n    [\"-0.600\", \"-0.400\", \"-0.200\", \"-0.0888f\", \"0.200\", \"0.400\", \"0.600\", \"0.800\", \"1.00\", \"1.20\", \"1.40\", \"1.60\", \"1.80\", \"2.00\"]\n\nThe -0.0888f representation looks very out of place. I understand why the algorithm generates this result, and looking at -8.881784197001253e-17 in isolation it makes sense to produce \"-0.0888f\" as the result. But in context, it's wrong. I believe this issue will only occur in cases very close to zero (otherwise the floating point error is dominated by a non-error component). So maybe the right way to fix this is to have the axis tick generator clean near-zero values as a special case.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/d3/d3/issues/1722/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/d3/d3/issues/1722/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/d3/d3/issues/comments/38410257","html_url":"https://github.com/d3/d3/issues/1746#issuecomment-38410257","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/d3/d3/issues/1746","id":38410257,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM4NDEwMjU3","user":{"login":"mbostock","id":230541,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMDU0MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/230541?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock","html_url":"https://github.com/mbostock","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-03-24T03:44:55Z","updated_at":"2014-03-24T03:44:55Z","body":"It would be reasonable to make this behavior automatic inside d3_scale_linearTickFormat; you’d detect when the \"s\" format was used, and determine the appropriate precision across all ticks in d3_scale_linearFormatPrecision.\n\nThe caveat to this is that you want to use the SI prefixes (scale = -1) but with fixed number formatting (type = \"f\") rather than significant digits.
