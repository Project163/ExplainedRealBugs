If anything, it should behave as if that argument is coerced to a string. So,\n\n``` js\nselection.classed(undefined, true);\n```\n\nShould be equivalent to:\n\n``` js\nselection.classed(\"undefined\", true);\n```\n\nLikewise, `null` should be treated as `\"null\"`.\n\nCurrently, trying to pass null or undefined blows up on all browsers because the implementation immediately calls string.trim on the specified class name. Coercing this to a string would fix the crash, but it still wouldn’t do what you are asking. It would be equivalent to:\n\n``` js\nselection.classed(className || \"undefined\", true);\n```\n\nI think the if statement is probably what you need here, or you need a suitable fallback class when your class name is undefined. Or you could filter your selection in lieu of an if statement, but that might be silly.\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/d3/d3/issues/comments/28214258/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"mbostock","id":230541,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMDU0MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/230541?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock","html_url":"https://github.com/mbostock","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/d3/d3/issues/comments/28280948","html_url":"https://github.com/d3/d3/issues/1625#issuecomment-28280948","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/d3/d3/issues/1625","id":28280948,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI4MjgwOTQ4","user":{"login":"dwt","id":57199,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3MTk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/57199?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dwt","html_url":"https://github.com/dwt","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dwt/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dwt/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dwt/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dwt/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dwt/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dwt/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dwt/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dwt/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dwt/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2013-11-12T09:58:25Z","updated_at":"2013-11-12T09:58:25Z","body":"Well, maybe I'm tainted too much by jQuery here, but I really like the way it's API allows you to hand data through without a lot of ifs around the calls and get sane results.\n\nIn our case, we're building some library code and would like to allow users to attach custom classes to d3 objects.

nonstandard string coercion would be surprising. The value `undefined` is coerced to `\"undefined\"` and the value `null` is coerced to `\"null\"`. Consider this:\n\n``` js\ndocument.body.setAttribute(undefined, \"42\");\ndocument.body.setAttribute(null, \"bar\");\n```\n\nResults in:\n\n``` html\n<body undefined=\"42\" null=\"bar\">\n```\n\nNow, it is true that D3 special-cases null (and undefined) _values_ to remove the attribute, because I wanted a single method that could both add and remove attributes. So D3 isn’t trying to mimic this behavior:\n\n``` js\ndocument.body.setAttribute(\"foo\", null);\n```\n\nWhich results in:\n\n``` html\n<body foo=\"null\">\n```\n\nBut, removing an attribute is functionality (it changes the DOM), where as doing nothing is a noop. So it feels wrong to special case a null or undefined class list here.\n\nThat said, since selection.classed does allow multiple class names (e.g., `selection.classed(\"foo bar\", true)`), I do think it makes sense to allow the empty string as a noop. I’ll file that as a separate
