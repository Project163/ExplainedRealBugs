tempted to revert the change in behavior for interpolateTransform. I feel like the behavior for CSS is designed the way it is because you can’t control the transition behavior—there’s no way to specify an interpolator; the specification has to go to great lengths to provide implicit control over the piecewise or consolidated transform interpolation by way of the format of the start and end transforms. In contrast D3 lets you specify the interpolator explicitly.\n\nFor completeness, I’ll try to enumerate the options:\n1. Do nothing (keep existing 2.9.7 behavior). The only way to force consolidated transform interpolation is to ensure that the start and end transforms are different types.\n2. Revert same-type transform detection from interpolateTransform, eliminating piecewise interpolation for same-type transforms. The only way to force piecewise interpolation is to override the interpolator using interpolateString. (This also requires specifying the starting transition explicitly when going from \"none\".)\n3. Revert the change to interpolateTransform, but keep the detection of same-type transforms in d3_interpolateByName. This makes the default behavior consistent with CSS, but allows the user to force piecewise interpolation by using interpolateString or force consolidated interpolation by using interpolateTransform.\n\nThe last option sounds appealing, but I’m not convinced it’s a good idea. Having different behavior for transforms that are the same type seems brittle and difficult to control; it’d be like magically switching to interpolateHsl if the start and end attributes are HSL-formatted colors, rather than always using interpolateRgb.\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/d3/d3/issues/comments/7504014/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"mbostock","id":230541,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMDU0MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/230541?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock","html_url":"https://github.com/mbostock","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"actor":{"login":"mbostock","id":230541,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMDU0MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/230541?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock","html_url":"https://github.com/mbostock","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2012-08-04T18:20:36Z","updated_at":"2012-08-04T18:20:36Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/d3/d3/issues/747","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/d3/d3","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/d3/d3/issues/747/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/d3/d3/issues/747/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/d3/d3/issues/747/events","html_url":"https://github.com/d3/d3/issues/747","id":6031743,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU2MDMxNzQz","number":747,"title":"Shorter

to #725 #746, it might be nice to have a shorter syntax for changing the interpolator used for a transition. Currently the only way to override the interpolator is by specifying a custom tween. For example, if you wanted to use interpolateHsl on an attribute, you might say:\n\n``` js\ntransition.attrTween(\"fill\", function(d, i, a) {\n  return d3.interpolateHsl(a, \"hsl(180, 50%, 50%)\");\n});\n```\n\nAn alternative might be to specify an interpolator as an additional argument to transition.attr:\n\n``` js\ntransition.attr(\"fill\", \"hsl(180, 50%, 50%)\", d3.interpolateHsl);\n```\n\nHowever, this wouldn’t work that well for transition.style, since there’s already an optional _priority_ argument (for important properties). I suppose you could do type inference on the _priority_: if it’s a function, assume that it’s an interpolator, otherwise it’s a string and there may be an optional fourth argument for the interpolator. That’s kind of icky but not horrible.\n\nAnother option might be some higher-order programming convenience functions. For each d3.interpolateFoo, we could have a d3.tweenFoo:\n\n``` js\ntransition.attrTween(\"fill\", d3.tweenHsl(\"hsl(180, 50%, 50%)\"));\n```\n\nWhere d3.tweenHsl is implemented as:\n\n``` js\nd3.tweenHsl = function(b) {\n  return function(d, i, a) {\n    return d3.interpolateHsl(a, b);\n  });\n};\n```\n\nOr even:\n\n``` js\ntransition.attrTween(\"fill\", d3.tween(d3.interpolateHsl)(\"hsl(180, 50%, 50%)\"));\n```\n\nWhere:\n\n``` js\nd3.tween = function(interpolator) {\n  return function(b) {\n    return function(d, i, a) {\n      return d3.interpolateHsl(a, b);\n    });\n  };\n};\n```\n\nThe optional argument to transition.attr and transition.style looks the most convenient, though.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/d3/d3/issues/747/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/d3/d3/issues/747/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":22073394,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MjIwNzMzOTQ=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/d3/d3/issues/events/22073394","actor":{"login":"mbostock","id":230541,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMDU0MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/230541?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock","html_url":"https://github.com/mbostock","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":"91630afcab4cee316817ec930b9bfb034b8e10e0","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/d3/d3/commits/91630afcab4cee316817ec930b9bfb034b8e10e0","created_at":"2012-08-04T19:13:49Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/d3/d3/issues/comments/7667094","html_url":"https://github.com/d3/d3/issues/746#issuecomment-7667094","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/d3/d3/issues/746","id":7667094,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc2NjcwOTQ=","user":{"login":"jasondavies","id":31223,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxMjIz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/31223?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasondavies","html_url":"https://github.com/jasondavies","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasondavies/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasondavies/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasondavies/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasondavies/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasondavies/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasondavies/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasondavies/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasondavies/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasondavies/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2012-08-11T14:20:10Z","updated_at":"2012-08-11T14:20:10Z","body":"Your reasoning all makes sense.  I suppose the only issue that I can see with d3.interpolateString for transforms is that we're back to the munging problem in Firefox: #344.\n\nSince this only seems to apply to the transform attribute, a solution to this particular issue is to provide some kind of helper:\n1. Bring back the same-type piecewise interpolation.  However, even this is not perfect e.g. it seems impossible to retrieve a non-zero rotate origin using the SVG API (I made a note about this in bb075f612e22a220b2fe0f3a47e5e387c8d19a07).\n2. Stash the unmunged transform attribute in a special property so it can be used as the starting value with d3.interpolateString.  This could be somewhat generic i.e. provide a way to bypass any munging that may happen with other attributes or style properties.  Something like:\n\n``` js\n  .attr(\"transform\", d3.stash(\"transform\", \"translate(100 0)\"))\n.transition()\n  .attr(\"transform\", \"transform\", \"translate(100 100)\",\n    d3.unstash(\"transform\", d3.interpolateString));\n```\n\nI guess it would be nice to avoid the repetition of \"transform\" though. Implementations would roughly be:\n\n``` js\nd3.stash = function(name, value) {\n  this[\"__\" + name] = value;\n};\n\nd3.unstash = function(name, interpolator) {\n  return function(a, b) {\n    return interpolator.call(this, this[\"__\" + name], b);\n  };\n};\n```\n\nIf Firefox munges the attribute it seems like both d3.interpolateString and d3.interpolateTransform will be slightly inadequate in some edge cases, so stashing seems like a relatively simple solution, if a bit ugly.\n","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/d3/d3/issues/comments/7667094/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"jasondavies","id":31223,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxMjIz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/31223?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasondavies","html_url":"https://github.com/jasondavies","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasondavies/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasondavies/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasondavies/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasondavies/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasondavies/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasondavies/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasondavies/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasondavies/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasondavies/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/d3/d3/issues/comments/7667303","html_url":"https://github.com/d3/d3/issues/746#issuecomment-7667303","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/d3/d3/issues/746","id":7667303,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc2NjczMDM=","user":{"login":"jasondavies","id":31223,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxMjIz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/31223?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasondavies","html_url":"https://github.com/jasondavies","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasondavies/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasondavies/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasondavies/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasondavies/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasondavies/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasondavies/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasondavies/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasondavies/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasondavies/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2012-08-11T14:54:01Z","updated_at":"2012-08-11T14:54:01Z","body":"Perhaps a more elegant solution: inspired by your idea in #344, how about providing a version of interpolateString that treats missing values as zeroes?

This gets around the rotate(a x y) problem that we had when using the SVG API directly.\n\nWe could say:\n\n``` js\n.attrTween(\"transform\", d3.tween(\"translate(100 100)\",\n    d3.interpolateTransformPiecewise));\n```\n\nWhere:\n\n``` js\nd3.interpolateTransformPiecewise = function(a, b) {\n  return d3.interpolateString(d3_interpolateTransformCanonical(a), b);\n};\n```\n\nNow that we have d3.tween, we no longer have to worry about breaking other attributes since this interpolator is entirely optional. Hurrah!\n\nI'm assuming the user will supply a canonical end value but I guess it could also be canonicalised for good measure.\n","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/d3/d3/issues/comments/7668719/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"jasondavies","id":31223,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxMjIz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/31223?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasondavies","html_url":"https://github.com/jasondavies","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasondavies/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasondavies/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasondavies/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasondavies/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasondavies/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasondavies/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasondavies/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasondavies/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasondavies/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}}]
