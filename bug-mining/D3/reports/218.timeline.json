I came across the described \"problem\" when implementing browser history support for user interaction in this lousy prototype: http://justdharma.com/d3/radial-sub-graph-history/ (basically when flipping quickly through former states of the graph display via browser back everything gets messed up) By looking closer into this today i realized that this is mainly due to not having this history support use case in mind when implementing it (and being a d3 newbie anyway) So most likely all \"problems\" in this example could be solved with a more solid implementation yet I will try is to get a jsfiddle together in which the described feature request would come in very handy.

It's a radial display of types of nodes with varying size/halo/distance from center, and multiple tabs of data with transitions when changed. The legend identifies each type of node.\n\nUsing mouseover/mouseout on a legend icon transitions to enlarge the data nodes and labels for that type. When you try to change to another tab of data, if you then hover over a legend icon it interrupts the transition and you end up with nodes whose icons and text labels are rotated at funny angles and sized wrong.\n\nI was trying to set a flag to disable transitions when the main tab change happens so that the mouseover would be ignored until the main transition ends. \n\nSo the ability to turn off further transitions and/or an onTransitionEnd type event would be v. useful.\n\nSee the attached screenshots. the First one is a normal display showing how hover over legend expands the nodes for visibility. Then I clicked a Tab and hovered over a legend icon at the bottom and you can see in the second screenshot the node icons are shrunk too small and rotated wrong.\n\n![d3-transition-1](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/968686/2040526/ea4e1702-89b7-11e3-9e9a-23bfc07ddc71.png)\n![d3-transition-4](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/968686/2040528/ef58cada-89b7-11e3-919d-911788192664.png)\n","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/d3/d3/issues/comments/33689380/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"bcowgill","id":968686,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk2ODY4Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/968686?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bcowgill","html_url":"https://github.com/bcowgill","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bcowgill/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bcowgill/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bcowgill/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bcowgill/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bcowgill/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bcowgill/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bcowgill/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bcowgill/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bcowgill/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/d3/d3/issues/comments/33705638","html_url":"https://github.com/d3/d3/issues/1609#issuecomment-33705638","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/d3/d3/issues/1609","id":33705638,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMzNzA1NjM4","user":{"login":"mbostock","id":230541,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMDU0MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/230541?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock","html_url":"https://github.com/mbostock","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-01-30T16:39:17Z","updated_at":"2014-01-30T16:39:17Z","body":"@bcowgill
