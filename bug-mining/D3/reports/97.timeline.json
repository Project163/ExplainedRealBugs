We could probably do a better job of defining the behavior for duplicate keys.\n\nConsider the following example:\n\n``` js\nvar div = d3.select(\"body\").selectAll(\"div\")\n    .data([\"aa\", \"ab\", \"ac\", \"ba\", \"bb\", \"bc\"])\n  .enter().append(\"div\")\n    .text(function(d) { return d; });\n\ndiv = div\n    .data([\"aa\", \"ab\", \"ba\", \"bb\"], function(d) { return d.substring(0, 1); });\n```\n\nBecause the key function only takes the first character, there are duplicates in both the data and the selection. Looking at the second join, here are the elements and their corresponding keys (in parentheses):\n\n```\ndata      - [ aa (a), ab (a), ba (b), bb (b)]\nselection - [ aa (a), ab (a), ac (a), ba (b), bb (b), bc (b)]\n```\n\nThe current behavior in 3.0.2 is:\n\n```\nenter     - [   null, ab (a),   null, bb (b)]\nupdate    - [ aa (a),   null, ba (b),   null]\nexit      - [   null,​   null,   null,   null, ab (a), ac (a), bb (b), bc (b)]\n```\n\nThe intent is that the _enter_ and _update_ selections match the data, while the _exit_ selection matches the original selection. But because of the duplicates, **ab** and **bb** appear in both the enter and exit selection. And likewise, the exit selection doesn’t match the structure of the original selection.\n\nProbably the more correct output is:\n\n```\nenter     - [   null,   null,   null,   null]\nupdate    - [ aa (a),   null, ba (b),   null]\nexit      - [   null,​ ab (a), ac (a),   null, bb (b), bc (b)]\n```\n\nThe result of this change will be that when there is a duplicate key in your data, only the first datum is considered and subsequent matching data are ignored.\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/d3/d3/issues/comments/12022283/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"mbostock","id":230541,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMDU0MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/230541?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock","html_url":"https://github.com/mbostock","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"actor":{"login":"mbostock","id":230541,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMDU0MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/230541?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock","html_url":"https://github.com/mbostock","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2013-01-08T23:21:57Z","updated_at":"2013-01-08T23:21:57Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/d3/d3/issues/998","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/d3/d3","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/d3/d3/issues/998/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/d3/d3/issues/998/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/d3/d3/issues/998/events","html_url":"https://github.com/d3/d3/pull/998","id":9787420,"node_id":"MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0MzU5NDcwNg==","number":998,"title":"Fix
