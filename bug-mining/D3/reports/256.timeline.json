catch. I’m kind of amazed this hasn’t been reported before, but my guess is that most people have been passing lower-case names to _selection_.append.\n\nThe problem here is an interaction between [document.createElement](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/createElement),  [document.createElementNS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/createElementNS) and _selection_.append. According to the spec, createElement has special behavior on HTML documents:\n\n> When called on a document object flagged as an HTML document, createElement() lower-cases its argument prior to creating the element.\n\nThis behavior does not apply to createElementNS. And, since _selection_.append inherits the namespaceURI from the parent element, it almost always uses createElementNS, even for HTML documents. So, when you append th elements, instead of creating them like so:\n\n```\ndocument.createElement(\"th\");\n```\n\nIt is using this:\n\n```\ndocument.createElementNS(\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\", \"th\");\n```\n\nSo, if you say \"TH\" rather than \"th\", it creates the wrong element type (and hence why the table doesn’t render correctly). Confusingly, though, the DOM spec actually _upper-cases_ tag names when you inspect them via _element_.tagName, so it’s not immediately obvious that something went wrong. However, if you pull out the body innerHTML, you can see the top row is unusual:\n\n``` html\n<div class=\"holder\">\n  <table>\n    <tbody><tr id=\"d3RowUpper\"><TH>HEY</TH><TH>YOU</TH></tr>\n    <tr id=\"d3RowLower\"><th>WHO</th><th>ME</th></tr>\n    <tr id=\"docRow\"><th>YEAH</th><th>YOU</th></tr>\n    <tr id=\"htmlRow\">\n      <th>WELL</th>\n      <th>WHAT?</th>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody></table>\n</div>\n```\n\nThe fix here is probably to have D3 lower-case the specified element name if the namespace is XHTML. Alternatively, D3 could use document.createElement rather than document.createElementNS if the parent element’s namespace matches the document element’s namespace. The latter should be equivalent, though perhaps slightly more general.\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/d3/d3/issues/comments/175747502/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"mbostock","id":230541,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMDU0MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/230541?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock","html_url":"https://github.com/mbostock","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":528458573,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50NTI4NDU4NTcz","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/d3/d3/issues/events/528458573","actor":{"login":"mbostock","id":230541,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMDU0MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/230541?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock","html_url":"https://github.com/mbostock","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":"05fd32dd68b49313502e9501792ef015bfc8c153","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/d3/d3/commits/05fd32dd68b49313502e9501792ef015bfc8c153","created_at":"2016-01-27T17:33:14Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/d3/d3/issues/comments/175760115","html_url":"https://github.com/d3/d3/issues/2722#issuecomment-175760115","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/d3/d3/issues/2722","id":175760115,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE3NTc2MDExNQ==","user":{"login":"mbostock","id":230541,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMDU0MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/230541?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock","html_url":"https://github.com/mbostock","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-01-27T17:34:51Z","updated_at":"2016-01-27T17:34:51Z","body":"Fixed
