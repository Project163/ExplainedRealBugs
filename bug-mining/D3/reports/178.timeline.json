This listener is only overridden for the targeted element. However, the touchmove and touchend listener is overridden for the entire window, not just the target (so that it can capture these events outside the initially-targeted element).\n\nMy first thought is that perhaps the special touchstart listener should be applied to the window—rather than just the targeted element—for the duration of the gesture. This would make it consistent with touchmove and touchend. However, this would need to be a capturing listener and to stop propagation to prevent the normal touchstart listener on the target from also being triggered, so I’m not sure if this is a good solution.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the touchmove and touchend should be restricted to the targeted element—rather than applied to the entire window. This would allow you to have multiple drag gestures active on different elements simultaneously, as in the drag multiples example.\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/d3/d3/issues/comments/23589728/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"mbostock","id":230541,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMDU0MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/230541?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock","html_url":"https://github.com/mbostock","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/d3/d3/issues/comments/23590538","html_url":"https://github.com/d3/d3/issues/1497#issuecomment-23590538","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/d3/d3/issues/1497","id":23590538,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIzNTkwNTM4","user":{"login":"jasondavies","id":31223,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxMjIz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/31223?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasondavies","html_url":"https://github.com/jasondavies","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasondavies/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasondavies/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasondavies/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasondavies/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasondavies/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasondavies/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasondavies/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasondavies/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasondavies/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2013-08-30T21:32:59Z","updated_at":"2013-08-30T21:32:59Z","body":"I don’t think we want to restrict touchmove and touchend to the target element, because this would prevent panning by dragging outside the element, which is a nice feature.\n\nAs for listening for touchstart on the window: we currently override touchstart on the target element anyway to avoid creating a new closure for each touchstart.  So we could disable the touchstart on the target element instead, without needing to stop propagation.  However, there might still be an issue if multiple elements are zoomable.  You could potentially be panning on one element, then initiate a pinch-zoom gesture with a second finger while accidentally beginning to pan another element.\n\nSo maybe it would be best to filter the touches array to contain only points with identifiers in `locations0`.  This should fix this bug and allow simultaneous zooming on multiple elements, as each element-centric gesture has its own `locations0`.\n","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/d3/d3/issues/comments/23590538/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"jasondavies","id":31223,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxMjIz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/31223?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasondavies","html_url":"https://github.com/jasondavies","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasondavies/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasondavies/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasondavies/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasondavies/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasondavies/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasondavies/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasondavies/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasondavies/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasondavies/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":63324122,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDYzMzI0MTIy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/d3/d3/issues/events/63324122","actor":{"login":"jasondavies","id":31223,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxMjIz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/31223?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasondavies","html_url":"https://github.com/jasondavies","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasondavies/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasondavies/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasondavies/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasondavies/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasondavies/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasondavies/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasondavies/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasondavies/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasondavies/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"4b3795e195133b5144ab944244bbc93a37f92d06","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/d3/d3/commits/4b3795e195133b5144ab944244bbc93a37f92d06","created_at":"2013-08-30T22:14:29Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"actor":{"login":"jasondavies","id":31223,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxMjIz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/31223?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasondavies","html_url":"https://github.com/jasondavies","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasondavies/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasondavies/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasondavies/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasondavies/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasondavies/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasondavies/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasondavies/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasondavies/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasondavies/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2013-08-30T22:14:42Z","updated_at":"2013-08-30T22:14:42Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/d3/d3/issues/1498","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/d3/d3","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/d3/d3/issues/1498/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/d3/d3/issues/1498/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/d3/d3/issues/1498/events","html_url":"https://github.com/d3/d3/pull/1498","id":18812292,"node_id":"MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0Nzk5ODM1Mw==","number":1498,"title":"Support

#1497. Because we listen to touchmove and touchend events on the window, whereas touchstart events are restricted to the targeted element, it was possible to receive a touchmove event for a new touch that started outside the targeted element without first receiving its touchstart event. The fix is to put the temporary touchstart listener during the gesture on the window, like the touchmove and touchend events. We also use a capturing listener and temporarily disable the touchstart listener on the target to prevent duplicate touchstart events from being received.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/d3/d3/issues/1499/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/d3/d3/issues/1499/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":63326231,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDYzMzI2MjMx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/d3/d3/issues/events/63326231","actor":{"login":"mbostock","id":230541,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMDU0MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/230541?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock","html_url":"https://github.com/mbostock","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"7448e63fa80ecb15e8cf4856a72b69d87e6431bf","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/d3/d3/commits/7448e63fa80ecb15e8cf4856a72b69d87e6431bf","created_at":"2013-08-30T22:34:47Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/d3/d3/issues/comments/23593097","html_url":"https://github.com/d3/d3/issues/1497#issuecomment-23593097","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/d3/d3/issues/1497","id":23593097,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIzNTkzMDk3","user":{"login":"mbostock","id":230541,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMDU0MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/230541?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock","html_url":"https://github.com/mbostock","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2013-08-30T22:36:39Z","updated_at":"2013-08-30T22:36:39Z","body":"Yep,

I've put the updated example on http://imonitormy.joshbuckley.co.uk/debug-d3/3.html. \n\nThanks for looking into this so quickly!\n","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/d3/d3/issues/comments/23606621/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"joshbuckley182","id":957402,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk1NzQwMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/957402?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshbuckley182","html_url":"https://github.com/joshbuckley182","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshbuckley182/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshbuckley182/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshbuckley182/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshbuckley182/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshbuckley182/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshbuckley182/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshbuckley182/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshbuckley182/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshbuckley182/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/d3/d3/issues/comments/23606914","html_url":"https://github.com/d3/d3/issues/1497#issuecomment-23606914","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/d3/d3/issues/1497","id":23606914,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIzNjA2OTE0","user":{"login":"jasondavies","id":31223,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxMjIz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/31223?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasondavies","html_url":"https://github.com/jasondavies","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasondavies/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasondavies/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasondavies/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasondavies/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasondavies/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasondavies/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasondavies/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasondavies/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasondavies/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2013-08-31T14:11:43Z","updated_at":"2013-08-31T14:11:43Z","body":"I don’t have an iOS device handy to test this, but I think I’ve figured out the problem and pushed a fix.

experiencing an issue with a tree graph based on: \n\nhttp://bl.ocks.org/robschmuecker/7880033\n\nI'm using chrome for android, but it also seems to happen in firefox for android. D3 version is 3.4.6.\n\nThe problem seems to occur when I start panning my layout with the first touch being over a node. When I add a second finger outside of the node (but inside the svg) and let go of the first touch, the zoom behavior stops working (except for doubletap zoom). The only way to get the zoom behavior back, is by starting it on the initial node, or manualy readding the svg.on('zoom', zoom).\n\nI think the problem is caused by the last touch event not having the same target as the initial touch.\nI've read some suggestions where pointer event are captured by an overlay to make sure everything has the same target, however I need my nodes to be clickable. \n\nUsing zoomstart and zoomend events to dynamically add an overlay doesn't seem to work because the overlay gets added at the first touch, so my nodes still aren't clickable.\n\nI managed to replicate the error in the above example, by pressing on the root node, placing my 2nd finger to the left of the graph and lifting my first finger.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/d3/d3/issues/1850/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/d3/d3/issues/1850/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
