Issue #1005 for both behavior.zoom and behavior.drag\n\nThis fixes (which we're using at appneta to fix this issue in our app for both zoom and drag) cases when code intended to suppress superfluous click events on dragend causes a later click (anywhere on the page) to be absorbed.\n\nSince the undesired click event should fire immediately after dragend, before returning to the JS event loop, the 0ms setTimeout where we clear the handler would only ever fire after the click event.  This should also take place fast enough that most human users would never make a subsequent click before the setTimeout fires.\n\nThis is a bit hacky as noted in https://github.com/mbostock/d3/issues/1005#issuecomment-15592805, but is probably less complicated than trying to discern cases/browsers/versions where the click does and does not fire.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/d3/d3/issues/1175/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/d3/d3/issues/1175/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":43485555,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDQzNDg1NTU1","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/d3/d3/issues/events/43485555","actor":{"login":"tillberg","id":104587,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNDU4Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/104587?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillberg","html_url":"https://github.com/tillberg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillberg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillberg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillberg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillberg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillberg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillberg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillberg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillberg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillberg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"636c3dbb6a66fc48d387a56f756e67ca5d81a2b7","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/appneta/d3/commits/636c3dbb6a66fc48d387a56f756e67ca5d81a2b7","created_at":"2013-03-30T00:24:44Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/d3/d3/issues/comments/16008208","html_url":"https://github.com/d3/d3/issues/1005#issuecomment-16008208","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/d3/d3/issues/1005","id":16008208,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE2MDA4MjA4","user":{"login":"mbostock","id":230541,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMDU0MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/230541?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock","html_url":"https://github.com/mbostock","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2013-04-07T02:31:40Z","updated_at":"2013-04-07T02:31:40Z","body":"Fixed

See #312 and specifically @jasondavies’ comment:\n\n> The problem is that the browser only fires a click event if mousedown and mouseup occur on the same element. So if you have a mousedown occurring on one element, and then mouseup on another, no click event is fired. This could happen in a number of ways e.g. if you clamped the dragged element and mouseup occurred outside the clamp region.\n> \n> We had mistakenly assumed that a click event is always fired after mousedown + mouseup, so we always cancelled the next click event. In the original bug report, the OP found that he had to double-click on links after dragging a different element, because the next click was always being cancelled. We only want to cancel the click if it is actually going to be fired as a result of the mousedown + mouseup combination, which isn't always the case.\n\nThat said, it looks like we don’t need this sanity-check since we added the 0ms timeout, which automatically expires click suppression if a click event doesn’t immediately fire. In other words, since we only suppress an _immediate_ click event, we don’t have to worry about false positives due to inconsistent browser behavior. (Before the 0ms-timeout, the click could be suppressed indefinitely!)\n\nSo, I’d be okay with removing target checks and relying on the timeout for click suppression.\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/d3/d3/issues/comments/155899667/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"mbostock","id":230541,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMDU0MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/230541?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock","html_url":"https://github.com/mbostock","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":461721021,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50NDYxNzIxMDIx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/d3/d3/issues/events/461721021","actor":{"login":"jasondavies","id":31223,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxMjIz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/31223?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasondavies","html_url":"https://github.com/jasondavies","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasondavies/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasondavies/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasondavies/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasondavies/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasondavies/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasondavies/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasondavies/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasondavies/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasondavies/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2015-11-11T20:22:14Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":461721022,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDQ2MTcyMTAyMg==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/d3/d3/issues/events/461721022","actor":{"login":"jasondavies","id":31223,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxMjIz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/31223?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasondavies","html_url":"https://github.com/jasondavies","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasondavies/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasondavies/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasondavies/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasondavies/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasondavies/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasondavies/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasondavies/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasondavies/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasondavies/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2015-11-11T20:22:14Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":461724787,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDQ2MTcyNDc4Nw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/d3/d3/issues/events/461724787","actor":{"login":"mbostock","id":230541,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMDU0MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/230541?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock","html_url":"https://github.com/mbostock","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"86890a9a25fa32febed0a6ef225a27f8ad29ddbd","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/d3/d3/commits/86890a9a25fa32febed0a6ef225a27f8ad29ddbd","created_at":"2015-11-11T20:26:37Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"act
