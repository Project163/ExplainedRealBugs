My d3 experience has been great!  Thanks for your work! :)\n\nMy issue is when I use the geo.circle command:  I create multiple circles with the same exact precision, but with different angle values, I get variable number of coordinates (+/-1) that get returned to create the circle.\n\nHere's a plnkr that displays the example.  \nhttp://plnkr.co/edit/P5TIBOCq44P0y42npRTb\n\nI'm not sure if it's a clipping error, or a bug at all, but it's not exactly what I was expecting.  I may have a bad understanding however!  :)\n\nThanks so much!\n","closed_by":{"login":"mbostock","id":230541,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMDU0MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/230541?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock","html_url":"https://github.com/mbostock","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/d3/d3/issues/1476/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/d3/d3/issues/1476/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
