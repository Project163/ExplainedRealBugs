Check for `x0 == x1 && y0 == y1` and return a function that always returns `[x0, x1]` in that case.\n2. Subtract a tiny offset to `d` if it equals to 1\n\nInterpolating between the same point obviously isn't a \"normal\" use of interpolate but can happen in practice -- and should work properly in that
