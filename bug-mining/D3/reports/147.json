subject: End on tick option for axis/scale]\n\nI'd love the see the option to end the axis on a tick.\nToday I'm using `scale.nice` but sometimes the bars stick up quite a bit over the last tick line.\n\nA tick could be placed on top like this:\n![Alt1](http://f.cl.ly/items/3I3I130q273g0X1k1z0P/alt1.png)\nThis would make the tick spacing uneven though.\n\nAnother option is to keep an even tick spacing but just make the top value end on a tick:\n![Alt2](http://f.cl.ly/items/090G3b1W1Z0D1b0p0G08/alt2.png)\n\nI would prefer the latter since it avoids trouble with overlapping labels and I think it looks nicer.\n\nNot sure how this would work since the ticks are decided by the axis but the max value is decided by `scale.nice` but I'm sure there is a way.\n\nThoughts?\n","closed_by":{"login":"mbostock","id":230541,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMDU0MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/230541?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock","html_url":"https://github.com/mbostock","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/d3/d3/issues/1088/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/d3/d3/issues/1088/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
