avoids having to include a large number of locales in the D3 repository itself, and also reduces the potential for typos when transcribing locale mappings. Even if we do want to include many locales, we can include this as a script for easily generating them.\n\nIdeally the generated locale file should be deleted, otherwise unnecessary locale files could be left lying around.

Is there a standard way for doing
