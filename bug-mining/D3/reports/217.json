You can zoom in using the mousewheel, and the zoom will continue for some time after your finger lets up. If you zoom in past the upper bound of the zoom behavior’s scaleExtent, then subsequent mousewheel events have no visible effect (the display stays at the maximum zoom level). Yet these “invisible” mousewheel events still cause the focal point of the zoom behavior to stay locked to the mouse, so if you move your mouse shortly after a zoom, the viewport will appear glued to the mouse (as if a mouseup failed to register while panning). This corrects itself momentarily when momentum scrolling ends, but it’s a bit confusing. It might be good to ignore these events somehow…\n","closed_by":{"login":"mbostock","id":230541,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMDU0MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/230541?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock","html_url":"https://github.com/mbostock","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/d3/d3/issues/1933/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/d3/d3/issues/1933/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
