have posted the code at https://gist.github.com/2817050 which can be viewed at http://bl.ocks.org/2817050\n\nNote how when using log scale the tick values are all blank. You can flip to linear and power to see values show up for those.\n\nBasically what I'm trying to do is allow the display of any set of metrics for various timelines and allow switching between linear, power and log scales and resizing the graphs to fit whatever browser window they have. The example I've provided only has a single axis on the left but I'm working on some dual-axis use cases as well.\n\nThe data ranges can be from 0 to 4 or 0 to 10s of millions so the max value of the axes are calculated using d3.max whenever the data is loaded. It all has been working very well with the exception of this small glitch for log scale tick labels.\n\nLine 286 of line-graph.js can be modified from this:\n\n```\n        yAxisLeft = d3.svg.axis().scale(y).ticks(6, tickFormatForLogScale).orient(\"left\");\n```\n\nto the following to make the log ticks show up:\n\n```\n        yAxisLeft = d3.svg.axis().scale(y).ticks(10, tickFormatForLogScale).orient(\"left\");\n```\n\nThat is not an ideal thing to have to change though, as it then requires different values depending on what data is being passed in, what scale (log/linear/power) is being used and the vertical size of the chart.\n\nI have chosen to set the desired tick count to fit the vertical size I'm targeting and expected each of the axes to generate ticks accordingly and it was working well until one of my graphs didn't work with its dataset. After debugging I found it was because the data values caused a large number of ticks to be calculated which resulted in the conditional logic from my first comment preventing any tick labels to be created.\n\nAlso, if my use of the d3.js library or my javascript isn't correct, please let me know as I don't consider myself an expert at Javascript (and if that's the source of this issue I apologize for wasting your time).\n\nThank you for taking the time to look at this for me.\n","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/d3/d3/issues/comments/5958770/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"benjchristensen","id":813492,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxMzQ5Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/813492?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/benjchristensen","html_url":"https://github.com/benjchristensen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benjchristensen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benjchristensen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benjchristensen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benjchristensen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benjchristensen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benjchristensen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benjchristensen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benjchristensen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benjchristensen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":16511358,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MTY1MTEzNTg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/d3/d3/issues/events/16511358","actor":{"login":"mbostock","id":230541,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMDU0MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/230541?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock","html_url":"https://github.com/mbostock","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":"8fe5b945ed7f4867b13a257d424dd29b1dd37e13","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/d3/d3/commits/8fe5b945ed7f4867b13a257d424dd29b1dd37e13","created_at":"2012-05-29T22:19:01Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"actor":{"login":"mbostock","id":230541,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMDU0MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/230541?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock","html_url":"https://github.com/mbostock","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2012-05-29T22:19:13Z","updated_at":"2012-05-29T22:19:13Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/d3/d3/issues/659","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/d3/d3","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/d3/d3/issues/659/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/d3/d3/issues/659/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/d3/d3/issues/659/events","html_url":"https://github.com/d3/d3/pull/659","id":4805604,"node_id":"MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0MTQ1MDUzMQ==","number":659,"title":"Always

think the only change that needs to occur is this:\n\nreturn d / pow(f(log(d) + e)) < k ? format(d) : \"\";\n\nto \n\nreturn d / pow(f(log(d) + e)) <= k ? format(d) : \"\";\n\nYour previous change made it so the smallest value of k is 0.1, but the tick value (d / pow(f(log(d) + e))) ends up being 0.1 and thus never less than 0.1 in scenarios where k is 0.1\n\nThus, it just needs to be <= as opposed to just < k.\n\nI've posted my test and with the fixed version at http://bl.ocks.org/2876507\n\nThe diff can be seen here:

commit seemed to have also touched unit tests and triggered a build of the minified
