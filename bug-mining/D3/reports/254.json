changing the function call `define(d3);` to `define(this.d3 = d3);` in the file `d3/src/end.js` an error occurs in optimized almond.js packaged modules:\n\n`Cannot read property 'splice' of undefined (see https://github.com/jrburke/almond/issues/25)`\n\nThe change was introduced with:\ncommit-id: https://github.com/mbostock/d3/commit/1fad2e0cf7fba217eba0eadf3cae17c15090f1dd\n\nAn description of the problem is available here:\nhttps://github.com/jrburke/almond/issues/25\n\nIt seems that the r.js optimizer cannot detect the new function param pattern and hence it is not converting it to the working function call define('d3',d3);\n","closed_by":{"login":"mbostock","id":230541,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMDU0MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/230541?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock","html_url":"https://github.com/mbostock","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/d3/d3/issues/2617/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/d3/d3/issues/2617/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
