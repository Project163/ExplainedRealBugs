If namespace is the XMLNS namespace and neither name nor prefix is \"xmlns\", throw a \"NamespaceError\" exception.\n\nThe problem here is that we always call `setAttributeNS(namespace, localName, value)`, dropping the prefix.  In the example above we call `setAttributeNS(\"http://www.w3.org/2000/xmlns/\", \"ex\", \"http://example.com/\")`, triggering the exception.\n\nOne option could be to drop the xmlns prefix from d3.ns.qualify.  However, we currently drop unsupported prefixes entirely, so the call to setAttribute wouldn’t have the desired effect.\n\n(By the way, for your specific example, you can set the xmlns attributes using the DOM API directly by using selection.node() to retrieve the first Element in the selection.  It would be nice to find a solution in D3 if possible though.)\n","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/d3/d3/issues/comments/48322093/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"jasondavies","id":31223,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxMjIz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/31223?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasondavies","html_url":"https://github.com/jasondavies","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasondavies/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasondavies/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasondavies/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasondavies/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasondavies/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasondavies/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasondavies/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasondavies/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasondavies/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/d3/d3/issues/comments/48322931","html_url":"https://github.com/d3/d3/issues/1935#issuecomment-48322931","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/d3/d3/issues/1935","id":48322931,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ4MzIyOTMx","user":{"login":"gopeter","id":1242960,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNDI5NjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1242960?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gopeter","html_url":"https://github.com/gopeter","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gopeter/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gopeter/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gopeter/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gopeter/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gopeter/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gopeter/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gopeter/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gopeter/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gopeter/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-07-08T11:05:40Z","updated_at":"2014-07-08T11:05:40Z","body":"Yes, at the moment I add the namespace with the DOM API.

@mdtusz @cldougl \n\nI updated all out dependencies to their latest versions (using `npm outdated`).\n\nEverything went smoothly, **except for** `d3` where in its v3.5.7 fixed the _old d3 quirk_ requiring the `xmlns` namespaces to be input twice in `.attr()`.\n\nIssue: https://github.com/mbostock/d3/issues/1935\nFix: https://github.com/mbostock/d3/commit/a6f66e9dd37f764403fc7c1f26be09ab4af24fed\n\nI took the opportunity to add a file under `src/constants` exporting all the xmlns urls.

situation:\n\nWhen using `selection.attr()` to set a `xlink:href`-attribute then the [namspace function](https://github.com/d3/d3-selection/blob/master/src/namespace.js)  detaches the `xlink:`-prefix.\n\nWhen there is a SVG gradient like ...\n\n``` SVG\n<linearGradient id=\"gradient\"/>\n```\n\n... and you apply ...\n\n``` JavaScript\nd3.select(\"#gradient\")\n    .attr(\"xlink:href\", \"#anotherGradient\");\n```\n\n... then you get ...\n\n``` SVG\n<linearGradient id=\"gradient\" href=\"#anotherGradient\"/>\n```\n\nMy Firefox 48.0.2 browser correctly renders this gradient on use ([try yourself](https://jsfiddle.net/96zL6ghn/)). \n### problem:\n\nHowever the `xlink:`-prefix is part of the attribute name according to the [SVG standard](https://www.w3.org/TR/SVG/pservers.html#LinearGradientElementHrefAttribute). \n\n``` SVG\n<linearGradient id=\"gradient\" xlink:href=\"#anotherGradient\"/>\n```\n\n... is more conform to the standard.\n\nSo the `xlink:`-prefix is missing when using `d3.attr()` to set the `xlink:href`-attribute for linear gradients of SVG.\n### goal:\n\nIt is our goal to conform the SVG standard when creating SVG structures.\n### proposal:\n\nSo I propose to include the `xlink:`-prefix into [the set of non-detachable prefixes that currently contains the `xmlns:`-prefix](https://github.com/d3/d3-selection/blob/master/src/namespace.js). Yet I don't know if it is useful to detach the `xlink:`-prefix in other places.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/d3/d3-selection/issues/94/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/d3/d3-selection/issues/94/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"actor":{"login":"seagreen","id":1310143,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMTAxNDM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1310143?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/seagreen","html_url":"https://github.com/seagreen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seagreen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seagreen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seagreen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seagreen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seagreen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seagreen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seagreen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seagreen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seagreen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-01-26T01:31:16Z","updated_at":"2020-01-26T01:31:16Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pkamenarsky/replica/issues/13","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pkamenarsky/replica","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pkamenarsky/replica/issues/13/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pkamenarsky/replica/issues/13/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pkamenarsky/replica/issues/13/events","html_url":"https://github.com/pkamenarsky/replica/pull/13","id":554969338,"node_id":"MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0MzY3MDI4NTcx","number":13,"title":"Implement
