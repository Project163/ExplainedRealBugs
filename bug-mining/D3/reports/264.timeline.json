To answer your questions:\n1. The only effect of _layout_.size in 3.x was to set the focal point of the “gravity” force. This force has been replaced by the positioning forces [d3.forceX](https://github.com/d3/d3-force/blob/master/README.md#forceX) and [d3.forceY](https://github.com/d3/d3-force/blob/master/README.md#forceY), and you can set the focal point using [_x_.x](https://github.com/d3/d3-force/blob/master/README.md#x_x) and [_y_.y](https://github.com/d3/d3-force/blob/master/README.md#y_y), respectively. Or if you prefer, you can use [d3.forceCenter](https://github.com/d3/d3-force/blob/master/README.md#forceCenter) to keep the view centered on a given point, set via [_center_.x](https://github.com/d3/d3-force/blob/master/README.md#center_x) and [_center_.y](https://github.com/d3/d3-force/blob/master/README.md#center_y).\n2. There’s no _start_ event because the only way to start the simulation’s internal timer is by creating a new [d3.forceSimulation](https://github.com/d3/d3-force/blob/master/README.md#forceSimulation) or by calling [_simulation_.restart](https://github.com/d3/d3-force/blob/master/README.md#simulation_restart). So, if you want to do something on start, just call your code after doing one of the above.\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/d3/d3/issues/comments/246184827/reactions","total_count":5,"+1":5,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"mbostock","id":230541,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMDU0MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/230541?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock","html_url":"https://github.com/mbostock","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/d3/d3/issues/comments/246194116","html_url":"https://github.com/d3/d3/issues/2971#issuecomment-246194116","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/d3/d3/issues/2971","id":246194116,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI0NjE5NDExNg==","user":{"login":"ramtob","id":11027714,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMDI3NzE0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11027714?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ramtob","html_url":"https://github.com/ramtob","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ramtob/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ramtob/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ramtob/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ramtob/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ramtob/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ramtob/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ramtob/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ramtob/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ramtob/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-09-11T18:01:38Z","updated_at":"2016-09-11T18:01:38Z","body":"+1\n","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/d3/d3/issues/comments/246194116/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"ramtob","id":11027714,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMDI3NzE0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11027714?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ramtob","html_url":"https://github.com/ramtob","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ramtob/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ramtob/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ramtob/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ramtob/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ramtob/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ramtob/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ramtob/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ramtob/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ramtob/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/d3/d3/issues/comments/246201038","html_url":"https://github.com/d3/d3/issues/2971#issuecomment-246201038","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/d3/d3/issues/2971","id":246201038,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI0NjIwMTAzOA==","user":{"login":"syntagmatic","id":156229,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1NjIyOQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/156229?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/syntagmatic","html_url":"https://github.com/syntagmatic","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/syntagmatic/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/syntagmatic/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/syntagmatic/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/syntagmatic/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/syntagmatic/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/syntagmatic/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/syntagmatic/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/syntagmatic/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/syntagmatic/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-09-11T20:01:29Z","updated_at":"2016-09-11T20:02:49Z","body":"Here

The less code you post, the easier it is for someone to debug, and the more likely you are to get a helpful response.\n\nIf you have a question about D3’s behavior and want to discuss it with other users, also consider the [d3-js Google Group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/d3-js) or [joining](https://d3-slackin.herokuapp.com/) the [d3-js Slack](https://d3js.slack.com/).\n\nThank you! 🤗\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/d3/d3/issues/comments/246365635/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"mbostock","id":230541,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMDU0MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/230541?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock","html_url":"https://github.com/mbostock","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/d3/d3/issues/comments/246441080","html_url":"https://github.com/d3/d3/issues/2971#issuecomment-246441080","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/d3/d3/issues/2971","id":246441080,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI0NjQ0MTA4MA==","user":{"login":"ramtob","id":11027714,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMDI3NzE0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11027714?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ramtob","html_url":"https://github.com/ramtob","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ramtob/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ramtob/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ramtob/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ramtob/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ramtob/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ramtob/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ramtob/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ramtob/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ramtob/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-09-12T18:18:27Z","updated_at":"2016-09-12T18:18:27Z","body":"@mbostock Of course, I'm sorry, you must be super busy.\n\nJust one more question, if I may, specifically for you.
