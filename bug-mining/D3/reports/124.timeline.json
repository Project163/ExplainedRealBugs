to #317: having code for visiting each node in a hierarchy might be nice. We have that code internally, and it seems like we could expose it. Protovis had [visitAfter](http://mbostock.github.com/protovis/jsdoc/symbols/pv.Dom.Node.html#visitAfter) and visitBefore methods. D3 doesn't require that hierarchy nodes implement any particular interface (for example, they can be loaded from static JSON files), so we'd probably want a method signature like this:\n\n``` javascript\nhierarchy.visitAfter(node, function(node, depth) {\n  return stopVisiting;\n});\n```\n\nThere's no reason for this to be bound to a specific hierarchy layout instance, but making it a static method is more verbose.

It might work as follows:\n\n``` js\nd3_layout_treeVisitAfter(root, function(node) {\n  if (nodeSize != null) {\n    node.x = (node.x - x0) * nodeSize[0];\n    node.y = node.depth * nodeSize[1];\n  } else {\n    node.x = (node.x - x0) / (x1 - x0) * size[0];\n    node.y = node.depth / y1 * size[1];\n  }\n  delete node._tree;\n});\n```\n\nThe original suggestion of having individual dimensions be nullable is similar but a bit more flexible.\n\nThere's still a question of the origin, though. I'm guessing the root node should always be at the origin? Otherwise, you'd need to indicate what orientation of the tree you expect to determine a sensible center anchor for the root. Also, it's quite likely that when using fixed layout you'll still need to determine the computed full size of the tree, so as to size your container element (typically an SVG) appropriately. One way of doing this would be for setting layout.nodeSize to set size layout.size to the computed value automatically.\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/d3/d3/issues/comments/11173705/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"mbostock","id":230541,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMDU0MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/230541?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock","html_url":"https://github.com/mbostock","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"actor":{"login":"mbostock","id":230541,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMDU0MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/230541?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock","html_url":"https://github.com/mbostock","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2013-02-06T17:17:38Z","updated_at":"2013-03-10T10:48:11Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/d3/d3/issues/1056","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/d3/d3","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/d3/d3/issues/1056/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/d3/d3/issues/1056/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/d3/d3/issues/1056/events","html_url":"https://github.com/d3/d3/issues/1056","id":10665877,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWUxMDY2NTg3Nw==","number":1056,"title":"Setting

My preference would be to have additional properties like sizeX, sizeY, nodeSizeX, and nodeSizeY, with something like this:\n\n``` javascript\nif (nodeSize != null) {\n  node.x = (node.x - x0) * nodeSize[0];\n  node.y = node.depth * nodeSize[1];\n} else {\n  if (nodeSizeX != null) {\n    node.x = (node.x - x0) * nodeSizeX;\n  } else if (sizeX != null) {\n    node.x = (node.x - x0) / (x1 - x0) * sizeX;\n  } else {\n    node.x = (node.x - x0) / (x1 - x0) * size[0];\n  }\n  if (nodeSizeY != null) {\n    node.y = node.depth * nodeSizeY;\n  } else if (sizeY != null) {\n    node.y = node.depth / y1 * sizeY;\n  } else {\n    node.y = node.depth / y1 * size[1];\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThat should allow the fullest customization while still remaining backwards compatible. To fix the layout with specified node sizes, I specified a custom separation:\n\n``` javascript\n.separation(function (a,b) { return a.parent == b.parent ? 1 : 1 });\n```\n\nYou can [see the result
