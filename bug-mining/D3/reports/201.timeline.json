Calling d3.locale would return an object that defines a numberFormat method (or just \"format\"?) and a timeFormat method, equivalent to the current d3.format and d3.time.format respectively, but in the specified locale. So:\n\n``` js\nvar locale = d3.locale(…);\nlocale.numberFormat // equivalent to d3.format\nlocale.timeFormat // equivalent to d3.time.format\n```\n\nAlthough, I haven’t thought through how you could use this to create a tickFormat suitable for use with d3.time.scale.

Mike Bostock,\nout of the box D3.js is shipped with english text labels for months and week names.\nSetting axis-date-format is already possible and I can differ the format depending on the language.\nI like to add the option to do so for labels, too.\nIn my WebApp users can select their favourite language.\nBut I do not like to store multiple D3 files, differing only at a few rows of string definitions.\nWith this patch, you could overwrite the labels to any language you like.\n As far as I know, renaming this strings later does not produce side effects, because calculations e. g. european and us calendar weeks are already done.\n\n1) import d3.js\n2) set localised strings like\nswitch ( locale ) {\n            case 'de':\n                d3.time.setLocalizedStrings( MyLocalizations.localeStrings.de.dayNames,\n                        MyLocalizations.localeStrings.de.dayNamesShort,\n                        MyLocalizations.localeStrings.de.monthNames,\n                        MyLocalizations.localeStrings.de.monthNamesShort );\n                // localizeD3DateFormat: use german presets\n                break;\n            case 'fr':\n                d3.time.setLocalizedStrings( MyLocalizations.localeStrings.fr.dayNames,\n                        MyLocalizations.localeStrings.fr.dayNamesShort,\n                        MyLocalizations.localeStrings.fr.monthNames,\n                        MyLocalizations.localeStrings.fr.monthNamesShort );\n                break;\n            case 'en': ...........\n3) start using d3\n\nSo it is possible to rewrite the labels to any language you like without shipping multiple files of almost the same content.\nIs there a better way to do so?\nWhat is your oppinion?\n\nKind regards,\nDaniel Suess from

#750. Code that requires localization is now within a closure that has access to locale-specific strings.\n\nTo minimize the degree of isolation required, d3.scale.linear (and other quantitative scales, including d3.time.scale) still default to the en-US locale. However, you can create your own localized formats using locale.numberFormat and locale.timeFormat.\n\n(It would be possible to move these other classes to within d3.locale as well, but that would mean anything that depends on d3.scale.linear would also need to be moved within d3.locale, such as d3.svg.axis. I think it’s cleaner to leave them using a default locale rather and have people localize the formats explicitly, rather than classes that localize anything downstream; you can always reassign d3.format to a different locale if you want to change the default.)\n\nAlso introduces locale.timeFormat.multi which can be used to create a [multi-scale time format](http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/4149176), and improves currency formatting by allowing the currency symbol to appear after the numeric value.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/d3/d3/issues/1652/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/d3/d3/issues/1652/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":85014157,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDg1MDE0MTU3","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/d3/d3/issues/events/85014157","actor":{"login":"mbostock","id":230541,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMDU0MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/230541?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock","html_url":"https://github.com/mbostock","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"8349aa171cb8fd6147256a9fcb3def89df0afc39","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/d3/d3/commits/8349aa171cb8fd6147256a9fcb3def89df0afc39","created_at":"2014-01-08T21:08:58Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/d3/d3/issues/comments/31993356","html_url":"https://github.com/d3/d3/issues/750#issuecomment-31993356","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/d3/d3/issues/750","id":31993356,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMxOTkzMzU2","user":{"login":"mbostock","id":230541,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMDU0MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/230541?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock","html_url":"https://github.com/mbostock","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-01-10T00:47:20Z","updated_at":"2014-01-10T00:47:20Z","body":"Fixed
