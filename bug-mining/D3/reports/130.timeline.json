I am guessing with your transition that you did not previously initialize the opacity attribute to 0. Thus the starting value would have been `\"\"` (the empty string).\n\nYour fix works because transition.style uses the computed style value, and so can inherit the zero from the stylesheet you specified when starting the transition. You could have also fixed this by saying `selection.attr(\"opacity\", 0)` before starting the transition.\n\nWhat changed in release 3.1.5 is the behavior of `d3.interpolate(\"\", 1)`. Previously, the empty string was coerced to a number, which made it zero, and then this was interpolated smoothly from zero to one. However, 359546c80c2a07edd8b526b2956091eb35119767 changed the behavior since the start and end value are different types (one a string, the other a number), switching from interpolateNumber to interpolateString:\n\n``` js\nd3.interpolateString(\"\", 1)(.5); // returns \"1\"\nd3.interpolateNumber(\"\", 1)(.5); // returns 0.5\n```\n\nI need to think a bit as to whether the fix for #1180 #1179 #1176 was overzealous. The documentation for [d3.interpolate](https://github.com/mbostock/d3/wiki/Transitions#wiki-d3_interpolate) implies that the interpolation behavior is only dependent on the end type, so it’s possible that `d3.interpolate(\"\", 1)` should still use number rather than string interpolation.\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/d3/d3/issues/comments/17970490/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"mbostock","id":230541,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMDU0MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/230541?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock","html_url":"https://github.com/mbostock","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/d3/d3/issues/comments/17970580","html_url":"https://github.com/d3/d3/issues/1247#issuecomment-17970580","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/d3/d3/issues/1247","id":17970580,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE3OTcwNTgw","user":{"login":"will-vertigo","id":2791356,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3OTEzNTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2791356?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/will-vertigo","html_url":"https://github.com/will-vertigo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/will-vertigo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/will-vertigo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/will-vertigo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/will-vertigo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/will-vertigo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/will-vertigo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/will-vertigo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/will-vertigo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/will-vertigo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2013-05-15T22:34:10Z","updated_at":"2013-05-15T22:34:10Z","body":"This was seen in the latest version of Chrome and IE 9/10.
