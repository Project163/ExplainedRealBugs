(You can view private gists on bl.ocks.org now, also.) I forked your test case:\n- http://bl.ocks.org/3846051\n\nOne of the problems with your code is that you've inverted the meaning of polygon.clip: it's bounds.clip(polygon), meaning that the argument to the clip method is the polygon that you want to clip, and the object performing the clipping represents the bounding polygon. So, something like this:\n\n``` js\nvar rect = d3.geom.polygon([[0, 0], [0, height], [width, height], [width, 0]]);\nvar clippedPolygon = rect.clip(polygon);\n```\n\nClipping will also fail if you use a closing coordinate for d3.geom.polygon (i.e., an extra [0, 0] at the end), which should probably be documented or fixed.\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/d3/d3/issues/comments/9202294/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"mbostock","id":230541,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMDU0MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/230541?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock","html_url":"https://github.com/mbostock","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":26338407,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MjYzMzg0MDc=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/d3/d3/issues/events/26338407","actor":{"login":"mbostock","id":230541,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMDU0MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/230541?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock","html_url":"https://github.com/mbostock","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":"d9a1281e08c43e0073f4dabf791112b3f33e59aa","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/d3/d3/commits/d9a1281e08c43e0073f4dabf791112b3f33e59aa","created_at":"2012-10-06T23:40:58Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
