When using a document different from the one D3 was instantiated in, as in Node.js, this can cause an error:\n\n``` js\nvar d3 = require(\"d3\"),\n    jsdom = require(\"jsdom\");\n\nvar document = jsdom.jsdom(\"<html><body></body></html>\");\n\nd3.select(document).select(\"body\").append(\"div\"); // Error: Wrong document\n```\n\nInstead of using d3_document to create the new element, append and insert should use `this.ownerDocument` on the parent element. This ensures that the element always matches the document to which it is to be appended.\n\nNote that you can work around this issue by creating the elements yourself:\n\n``` js\nd3.select(document).select(\"body\").append(function() { return document.createElement(\"div\"); });\n```\n","closed_by":{"login":"mbostock","id":230541,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMDU0MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/230541?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock","html_url":"https://github.com/mbostock","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/d3/d3/issues/1533/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/d3/d3/issues/1533/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
