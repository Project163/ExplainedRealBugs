#1029. Previously, these interpolators returned RGB hexadecimal strings, as the intent was for the color to be used to set attributes and styles. However, since #333, all colors return RGB hexadecimal strings when coerced to a string, so we can get the equivalent behavior by returning a color instance rather than a string. Returning a color instance is also more useful in the case where additional color manipulation (such as brighter/darker) is desired.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/d3/d3/issues/1359/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/d3/d3/issues/1359/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":55140425,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDU1MTQwNDI1","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/d3/d3/issues/events/55140425","actor":{"login":"mbostock","id":230541,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMDU0MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/230541?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock","html_url":"https://github.com/mbostock","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"e5f7208131fdc099fada0627ed307653c95611ef","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/d3/d3/commits/e5f7208131fdc099fada0627ed307653c95611ef","created_at":"2013-07-03T16:58:16Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"actor":{"login":"mbostock","id":230541,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMDU0MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/230541?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock","html_url":"https://github.com/mbostock","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2013-07-03T17:01:48Z","updated_at":"2013-07-03T17:01:48Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/d3/d3/issues/1030","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/d3/d3","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/d3/d3/issues/1030/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/d3/d3/issues/1030/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/d3/d3/issues/1030/events","html_url":"https://github.com/d3/d3/issues/1030","id":10342160,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWUxMDM0MjE2MA==","number":1030,"title":"Interpolators

it is [well](https://github.com/mbostock/d3/wiki/Transitions#wiki-d3_interpolateArray) [documented](https://github.com/mbostock/d3/wiki/Transitions#wiki-d3_interpolateObject), it’s still perhaps a bit surprising that interpolateArray and interpolateObject return a shared instance for performance reasons. This makes perfect sense for its usage by d3.transition—the returned array or object is immediately coerced to a string or only used for a single tick. But it’s easy to forget for other applications that you need to make a copy of the returned object if you want to compare the results of multiple interpolation calls. See the an earlier version of the [rotating Voronoi](https://gist.github.com/4636377/c4338000bf5f4b5c56202be34c800e9319a2f56b) for example.\n\nPerhaps we could change these methods to return new instances, and then have an alternate method for reusing objects? Or perhaps interpolateArray and interpolateObject could take a third argument to use as the reusable destination object. For performance reasons, _not_ reusing an object may also require the use of new Function to create an object literal, as is done in d3_dsv.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/d3/d3/issues/1030/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/d3/d3/issues/1030/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":55411350,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDU1NDExMzUw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/d3/d3/issues/events/55411350","actor":{"login":"mbostock","id":230541,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMDU0MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/230541?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock","html_url":"https://github.com/mbostock","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"ce6526cfe3b70a8555bbb7b2f235af9c916d34a0","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/d3/d3/commits/ce6526cfe3b70a8555bbb7b2f235af9c916d34a0","created_at":"2013-07-05T18:18:14Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":55447933,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50NTU0NDc5MzM=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/d3/d3/issues/events/55447933","actor":{"login":"mbostock","id":230541,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMDU0MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/230541?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock","html_url":"https://github.com/mbostock","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":"ce6526cfe3b70a8555bbb7b2f235af9c916d34a0","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/d3/d3/commits/ce6526cfe3b70a8555bbb7b2f235af9c916d34a0","created_at":"2013-07-06T03:09:13Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
