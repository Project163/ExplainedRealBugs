[On line 260 of force.js](https://github.com/mbostock/d3/blob/master/src/layout/force.js#L260), `m` is being used as a closure from the outer scope: \n\n```\nfor (j = 0; j < m; ++j) /*...*/\n```\n\nwhere it is being initialized from the outer scope to `links.length`. Then a few lines later on it is being initialized:\n\n```\nvar /*...*/ m = candidates.length, /*...*/\nwhile (++j < m) /*...*/\n```\n\nBut my thought (besides the fact that it is unclear to use `m` with two meanings) is that the function scoping combined with var hoisting may be obscuring the `links.length` value with `undefined`? The two usages were added during different commits, so I'm wondering if it is unintended that `m` was reused.\n\nThe side effect is that the loop on line 260 never executes because `j < undefined` is always `false`;\n","closed_by":{"login":"mbostock","id":230541,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMDU0MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/230541?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock","html_url":"https://github.com/mbostock","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/d3/d3/issues/2207/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/d3/d3/issues/2207/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
