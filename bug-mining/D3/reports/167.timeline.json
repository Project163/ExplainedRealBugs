d524fe5 has created undesirable zoom behavior for me. I am using the latest current version of master (3.2.7).\n\nI see that d3 is now using user-select:none instead of preventDefault and stopPropagation for mouse/touch events that occur during zoom/drag operations, but I don't think this will work correctly in many cases.\n\nFor example, if the mouse (which should have capture during panning) leaves the d3 \"zoomable\" region, and then happens to hover over a textbox somewhere on the page, any text in that textbox is getting selected and the cursor becomes a text cursor instead of a drag cursor, which it should retain if the pointer is correctly being captured. Additionally, I'm getting unexpected scrolling in the browser window even though I am only panning my \"zoomable\" region. This is happening even in the latest version of Chrome.\n\nFor one, I don't think simply applying user-select:none style to the document element is sufficient to override the default style of a textbox which is -webkit-user-select:text.\n\nI agree with avoiding the use of stopPropagation (which I always felt was incorrectly being used in d3 and has caused me numerous headaches), but I think you still need preventDefault on your mousedown, mousemove, and mouseup events (and equivalent touch events) during zoom/drag in order to get proper pointer capture behavior.\n\nIncidentally, I quickly tried adding d3_eventPreventDefault calls to the mousedowned and touchstarted functions and it fixed the issues described above.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/d3/d3/issues/1419/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/d3/d3/issues/1419/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":60291707,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDYwMjkxNzA3","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/d3/d3/issues/events/60291707","actor":{"login":"mbostock","id":230541,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMDU0MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/230541?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock","html_url":"https://github.com/mbostock","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"c7461b0de365dd8b75dfb83825557f2e124481ad","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/d3/d3/commits/c7461b0de365dd8b75dfb83825557f2e124481ad","created_at":"2013-08-10T04:10:28Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/d3/d3/issues/comments/22598776","html_url":"https://github.com/d3/d3/issues/1422#issuecomment-22598776","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/d3/d3/issues/1422","id":22598776,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIyNTk4Nzc2","user":{"login":"mbostock","id":230541,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMDU0MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/230541?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock","html_url":"https://github.com/mbostock","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2013-08-13T21:24:03Z","updated_at":"2013-08-13T21:24:03Z","body":"Fixed
