`.call(axis)` throws an error when switching between logarithmic and linear scales and the linear domain crossed/contained 0 (the log domain is always adjusted before calling the axis function).\nThe axis function seems to try to call `scale(0)` for the tick label and fails, because it wants to translate to `(0,Infinity)`.\n\nI copied one of the public code samples provided on the axes documentation page and adjusted it to demonstrate:\nhttp://codepen.io/anon/pen/HsBAt (click 'change' button on top right side to see the
