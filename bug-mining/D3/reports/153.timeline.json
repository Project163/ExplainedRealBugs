Quantize scales do not support a ticks method (because the domain is discrete), and in this case the axis assumes that the scale exposes a rangeBand method. Ordinal scales do this, but quantize scales do not.\n\nSince you are using an axis, I assume you are using a position encoding for your data, in which case it is much more common to use a linear scale rather than a quantize scale. So, consider using a linear scale as a workaround for this problem. Quantize scales are primarily intended for colors which are otherwise difficult to distinguish, whereas our ability to distinguish position is much more precise.\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/d3/d3/issues/comments/20524124/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"mbostock","id":230541,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMDU0MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/230541?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock","html_url":"https://github.com/mbostock","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":55406921,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDU1NDA2OTIx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/d3/d3/issues/events/55406921","actor":{"login":"mbostock","id":230541,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMDU0MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/230541?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock","html_url":"https://github.com/mbostock","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"b745b32525c01263a1aebc89e0000d07c06f3c24","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/d3/d3/commits/b745b32525c01263a1aebc89e0000d07c06f3c24","created_at":"2013-07-05T17:35:05Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"actor":{"login":"mbostock","id":230541,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMDU0MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/230541?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock","html_url":"https://github.com/mbostock","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2013-07-05T17:35:50Z","updated_at":"2013-07-05T17:35:50Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/d3/d3/issues/1368","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/d3/d3","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/d3/d3/issues/1368/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/d3/d3/issues/1368/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/d3/d3/issues/1368/events","html_url":"https://github.com/d3/d3/pull/1368","id":16412428,"node_id":"MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0Njc1MzI5MQ==","number":1368,"title":"Fix

addition to ordinal scales, quantile, quantize and threshold scales don’t define a ticks method. Unlike ordinal scales, however, these quantitative scales also don’t define a rangeBand method, so the axis was crashing trying to render these scales. This fixes #1367 by checking for the required rangeBand method rather than assuming scales without a ticks method define a rangeBand.\n\nNote, however, that even with this change you probably still want to define tick values explicitly when using one of these scales with an axis. That’s because each tick in the axis represents a span of values in the domain; you can use the invertExtent method to get the span for each tick value.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/d3/d3/issues/1368/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/d3/d3/issues/1368/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":55447932,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50NTU0NDc5MzI=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/d3/d3/issues/events/55447932","actor":{"login":"mbostock","id":230541,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMDU0MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/230541?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock","html_url":"https://github.com/mbostock","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":"b745b32525c01263a1aebc89e0000d07c06f3c24","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/d3/d3/commits/b745b32525c01263a1aebc89e0000d07c06f3c24","created_at":"2013-07-06T03:09:13Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
