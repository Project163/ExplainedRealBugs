The mousewheel gesture is\ndeemed to be finished if 50ms passes with no mousewheel event.\n\nAlthough the \"zoomend\" event is only dispatched when _both_ gestures\nhave finished, the variable \"center0\" was being reset when _either_\ngesture was finished, causing an error in the mousewheel handler.\n\nFixes #2205.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/d3/d3/issues/2351/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/d3/d3/issues/2351/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/d3/d3/issues/comments/85507467","html_url":"https://github.com/d3/d3/issues/2205#issuecomment-85507467","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/d3/d3/issues/2205","id":85507467,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDg1NTA3NDY3","user":{"login":"jasondavies","id":31223,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxMjIz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/31223?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasondavies","html_url":"https://github.com/jasondavies","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasondavies/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasondavies/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasondavies/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasondavies/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasondavies/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasondavies/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasondavies/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasondavies/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasondavies/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-03-24T14:01:57Z","updated_at":"2015-03-24T14:01:57Z","body":"Proposed

find that occasionally when I'm editing, and zooming in/out at a time when the browser is for whatever reason under heavy load (usually zoomed out a little and there's a lot of editable features

(somewhere in the ocean, many thousands of kilometres away).\n\nI get that zooming might go 'too far' in or out when scrolling, but to translate the viewport vast distances across the world doesn't really make sense. I'm seeing it quite a bit if I zoom in and out a lot, almost always ending up looking very closely at a random section of the ocean—at first I thought the rendering had just failed and would have to exit the editor and reload OSM, not realising it'd just moved to an area with just a lot of near-black tiles.\n\nI've seen this on both Safari and Chrome (up-to-date versions of both as of July/August 2015) on Mac OS X.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openstreetmap/iD/issues/2773/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openstreetmap/iD/issues/2773/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
