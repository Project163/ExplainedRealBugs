investigate this, I modified your example to use the equirectangular projection, and it turns out that the degenerate polygon is being interpreted as CCW.  Even though `d3.geo.area` returns exactly zero, note that the projection has a rotation, and if you compute the area of the rotated polygon, it is no longer exactly zero; it is around -8e-22.\n\nOne thing I’ve been intending to do is swap the order of rotation and clipping, so that this area calculation would occur prior to rotation.  This means that programs such as TopoJSON can predict exactly which polygons would have this issue; we’d no longer be at the “mercy” of the precision of rotated coordinates.\n\nInitially I was tempted to add an epsilon of -1e-12 for point-in-polygon (which calculates area internally), and d3.geo.area for consistency.  However, the use of degenerate polygons should really be avoided if possible.  Most geometry algorithms simply don’t allow them, and it’s the same for self-intersecting polygons.  So if it’s practical, I’d prefer to have a consistent winding order algorithm (which isn’t dependent on rotation).\n\nIf we do end up wanting an epsilon, for whatever reason, note that it could have implications for the clip-polygon branch.  I think 1e-12 is probably okay, but we wouldn’t want anything much bigger in case it clashes with clip polygons that cover most of the globe (which is usually the case).  This is mainly why I’d prefer to stick with zero instead of an epsilon if possible.\n\nOne more thing: it’s strange that modifying clipExtent above fixed the issue.  I need to look into that to see what went wrong as that does seem like a bug.\n","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/d3/d3/issues/comments/22553379/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"jasondavies","id":31223,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxMjIz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/31223?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasondavies","html_url":"https://github.com/jasondavies","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasondavies/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasondavies/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasondavies/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasondavies/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasondavies/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasondavies/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasondavies/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasondavies/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasondavies/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/d3/d3/issues/comments/22575729","html_url":"https://github.com/d3/d3/issues/1453#issuecomment-22575729","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/d3/d3/issues/1453","id":22575729,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIyNTc1NzI5","user":{"login":"mbostock","id":230541,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMDU0MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/230541?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock","html_url":"https://github.com/mbostock","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2013-08-13T16:00:07Z","updated_at":"2013-08-13T16:00:07Z","body":"Thanks for investigating. Sorry for not understanding the problem exactly, but your description makes sense.\n\nI like the idea of rotating after clipping. In addition to being more predictable and consistent, that should have better performance, as the cost of a rotating the cut (antimeridian or circle) is likely negligible, and then there will be fewer points to rotate after clipping.\n\nRegarding degenerate polygons, do you think there’s a related improvement we could make in TopoJSON? I don’t really see that there’s much we could do, if we want to retain empty features. There’s a coincident point in the example polygon above, which we could remove, but that wouldn’t fix the immediate problem.\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/d3/d3/issues/comments/22575729/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"mbostock","id":230541,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMDU0MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/230541?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock","html_url":"https://github.com/mbostock","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/d3/d3/issues/comments/22649363","html_url":"https://github.com/d3/d3/issues/1453#issuecomment-22649363","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/d3/d3/issues/1453","id":22649363,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIyNjQ5MzYz","user":{"login":"mbostock","id":230541,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMDU0MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/230541?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock","html_url":"https://github.com/mbostock","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2013-08-14T16:46:03Z","updated_at":"2013-08-14T16:46:03Z","body":"Based

remove the rotation step that occurred prior to clipping, so that clipping processes unrotated polygons.  Note that clip regions are defined relative to the rotated globe, so clipping now needs a rotation parameter.\n\nRather than moving the rotation step so it occurs after clipping, the rotation occurs as part of clipping, using the rotation parameter to rotate streamed points.  Alternatively, points could be clipped against a rotated clip region, and then subsequently rotated as a separate step, but this seems slightly less efficient.\n\nFixes #1453.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/d3/d3/issues/1543/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/d3/d3/issues/1543/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":67456151,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50Njc0NTYxNTE=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/d3/d3/issues/events/67456151","actor":{"login":"jasondavies","id":31223,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxMjIz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/31223?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasondavies","html_url":"https://github.com/jasondavies","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasondavies/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasondavies/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasondavies/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasondavies/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasondavies/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasondavies/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasondavies/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasondavies/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasondavies/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":"31ea7dc0f1ff553c446d91591826ec2731fadff1","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/d3/d3/commits/31ea7dc0f1ff553c446d91591826ec2731fadff1","created_at":"2013-09-26T21:42:55Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
