I understand that the functions are hoisted, but this shouldn’t cause them to be undefined.\n\nIt's not a bug per se: the behavior in cases like this used to be completely unspecified, and browsers just did different things. The ES6 spec finally contains a specification, if only [in an annex](http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/6.0/index.html#sec-functiondeclarations-in-ifstatement-statement-clauses). Note that the difference is that in SpiderMonkey, the function is _not_ hoisted right now, whereas it is in other engines. Way more details than you're probably interested in can be found here: http://kangax.github.io/nfe/#expr-vs-decl.
