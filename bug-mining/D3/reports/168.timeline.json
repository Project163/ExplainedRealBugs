not sure yet if this is a good idea, but it does seem more flexible than subdividing ticks in the axis that were computed by the scale. The problem with the simpler fix of #1115 is that the axis can’t force the scale to generate two extra major ticks—those ticks could be irregularly-spaced, as is the case with a time scale.\n\nSo, rather than trying to subdivide ticks uniformly, the axis exposes a way of creating minor ticks. For example, you could have major ticks using d3.time.weeks, and minor ticks using d3.time.days. Any minor tick that is also a major tick is only displayed as a major tick. \n\nOne weakness with this approach is that it assumes there is a scale.ticks method, so there’s no way to create minor ticks for an ordinal scale or other scale that doesn’t support generating ticks. Likewise, although you can specify major ticks explicitly using axis.tickValues, I haven’t exposed an axis.minorTickValues method.\n\nThis pull request retains the axis.tickSubdivide method as a no-op, so that existing code will not break. However, this means you need to update code to call axis.minorTicks if you want minor ticks displayed. It’s possible in some cases to generate suitable minor tick arguments, and thus have better backwards-compatibility, but since it’s not possible in all cases this seems like a reasonable option. Alternatively we could defer this until 4.0?\n\nLastly, my other reservation is whether the axis needs an explicit concept of major and minor ticks at all. It seems like clients could specify only major ticks, and then use post-selection to mark a subset of them as minor ticks.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/d3/d3/issues/1350/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/d3/d3/issues/1350/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":54646650,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDU0NjQ2NjUw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/d3/d3/issues/events/54646650","actor":{"login":"mbostock","id":230541,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMDU0MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/230541?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock","html_url":"https://github.com/mbostock","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"05e1776414be921303e5cb77e5f21221aeecc11c","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/d3/d3/commits/05e1776414be921303e5cb77e5f21221aeecc11c","created_at":"2013-06-29T17:12:45Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/d3/d3/issues/comments/20233609","html_url":"https://github.com/d3/d3/issues/1115#issuecomment-20233609","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/d3/d3/issues/1115","id":20233609,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIwMjMzNjA5","user":{"login":"mbostock","id":230541,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMDU0MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/230541?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock","html_url":"https://github.com/mbostock","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2013-06-29T17:20:37Z","updated_at":"2013-06-29T17:20:58Z","body":"I’ve been looking at this issue, and the problem is there is no way for the axis to create additional major ticks for the purpose of subdividing to create additional minor ticks. (Well, it might be possible to abuse scale.nice, but in general I like that the axis doesn’t need to know how the ticks were generated.) So, I’m considering two solutions:\n- #1350 replaces axis.tickSubdivide with axis.minorTicks. It’s a similar idea, except because the scale generates both the major and minor ticks, you have more flexibility over where those minor ticks are placed (they need not be uniformly positioned between major ticks), and the scale will guarantee that the minor ticks cover the domain. I think this is a more intuitive and more explicit.\n- #1351 goes one step further and removes axis.tickSubdivide with no replacement, since you can achieve the same result of creating minor ticks by simply [post-selecting the ticks](http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/f2bedf50d1017f94a14d/66d95b225bd7d48c544df5bcbfcd9db4cfeee8e8). I like the simplicity of this approach, although sometimes it can be harder to remove functionality than to add it. :)\n\nIn either case, we can’t fix this in a patch release, so this will either be in 3.x or
