The zoom behavior has always called preventDefault and stopPropagation on touchstart events.

seems to a [bug](https://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=5491) in Android 4.1.x relating to touch events, whereby preventDefault seems to be needed on touchstart to prevent native scrolling from eating up the touchmove events.\n\nHowever, it doesn't seem to affect Android 4.2.x, so I don't think we need to anything here.  Unfortunately, pretty much anyone targeting Android will likely need to include their own touchstart with preventDefault to work around this, at least until enough users move to ≥4.2, so I'm recording this here for their benefit.\n","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/d3/d3/issues/comments/19403154/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"jasondavies","id":31223,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxMjIz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/31223?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasondavies","html_url":"https://github.com/jasondavies","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasondavies/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasondavies/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasondavies/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasondavies/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasondavies/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasondavies/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasondavies/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasondavies/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasondavies/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}}]
