the domain of `d3.scale.sqrt` takes a round trip through `Math.pow(x, 0.5)` and `Math.pow(x, 2)`, it's prone to floating-point errors, e.g.\n\n```\n> d3.scale.sqrt().domain([0, 5]).domain();\n[0, 5.000000000000001]\n```\n\nThis is particularly problematic when `.nice()`ing the scale, because the use of `Math.ceil` bumps the error up significantly:\n\n```\n> d3.scale.sqrt().domain([0, 5]).nice().domain()\n[0, 5.999999999999999]\n```\n\nWhile I assume the floating-point error in the domain can't be helped, it seems preferable to have checks in place so that `.nice()` would affect the domain in the same way for a linear scale or a sqrt scale.\n","closed_by":{"login":"mbostock","id":230541,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMDU0MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/230541?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock","html_url":"https://github.com/mbostock","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/d3/d3/issues/1241/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/d3/d3/issues/1241/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
