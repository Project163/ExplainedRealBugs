transform interpolation detection seems a bit too broad, since it currently applies to the CSS style as well as the SVG attribute.\n\nThis causes a failure in Firefox, which supports an unprefixed transform style (likewise, IE10), since it attempts to set the transform value on an internal SVG node for parsing.\n\nI also noticed that d3.interpolateObject calls `d3_interpolateByName`, but I'm not sure why this would be needed (perhaps a relic from something in the past?).\n\nWe could consider applying the same matrix decomposition to CSS transforms, but for now I propose we have a stricter check based on `name.space === d3_nsPrefix.svg && name.local === \"transform\"`, and presumably we can drop the calls to `d3_interpolateByName` in both transition.style and d3.interpolateObject.\n\n[Related](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/d3-js/rcGw3gwrSXQ/9Fr5rWSu-n8J).\n","closed_by":{"login":"mbostock","id":230541,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMDU0MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/230541?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock","html_url":"https://github.com/mbostock","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/d3/d3/issues/1323/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/d3/d3/issues/1323/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
