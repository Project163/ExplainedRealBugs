My guess is that one of the arc properties you’re specifying is NaN, so that NaN is being propagated into the resulting path string. I would use a debugger to step through your code and see what values you are passing to the arc generator, and then work backwards from there to see why the property is NaN.\n\nI did notice one bug in your code:\n\n``` js\nvar range = +y.range();\nvar yr = d3.interpolate(range, [dy ? selectionRadius : innerBtnRadius, radius-5]);\n```\n\nHere you’ve defined `range` by coercing a scale’s range (which is typically an array of numbers) to a number. That probably means that `range`’s value is NaN. Then you’re using d3.interpolate to interpolate from NaN to an array of two numbers. That probably means that the interpolator is always returning the latter array, regardless of the value of _t_.\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/d3/d3/issues/comments/69789229/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"mbostock","id":230541,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMDU0MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/230541?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock","html_url":"https://github.com/mbostock","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":218252447,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MjE4MjUyNDQ3","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/d3/d3/issues/events/218252447","actor":{"login":"mbostock","id":230541,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMDU0MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/230541?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock","html_url":"https://github.com/mbostock","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2015-01-13T18:02:46Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/d3/d3/issues/comments/69877035","html_url":"https://github.com/d3/d3/issues/2183#issuecomment-69877035","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/d3/d3/issues/2183","id":69877035,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY5ODc3MDM1","user":{"login":"wassx","id":3955210,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5NTUyMTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3955210?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wassx","html_url":"https://github.com/wassx","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wassx/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wassx/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wassx/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wassx/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wassx/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wassx/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wassx/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wassx/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wassx/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-01-14T07:04:36Z","updated_at":"2015-01-14T16:11:11Z","body":"Hi, sry to ask again, but maybe you haven't noticed, there is a example of the zoomable sunburst on codepen in the issue: \" and a codepen to test made by user VividD: http://codepen.io/VividD/pen/myRWRY
