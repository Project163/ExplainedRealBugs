added the ability for line charts to have a log axis. It's very minor code to add the functionality. \n\nAnd since log 0 returns -Infinity, I made it so the domain starts at either 0.1 or -0.1. I use clamp(true) so the chart starts at 0 if there are 0 values. You can't have both positive and negative values in your range since log is either positive or negative, not both.\n\nI've also added code for logAxis cases in the line.js for the tooltip so it draws the appropriate value and not what is returned by the _getFormat.\n\nSince d3.scale.log does not allow a set tick amount using the ticks function, I've had to use tickFormat and set it to a value (4 default). This hides the tick labels, but not the tick lines. I added a case in _getFormat.js to return the unique way logs get formatted.\n\nLet me know what you think (i.e. comments/suggestions). This makes drawing a chart where you have a large variance in values (One value ranges from 8,000 to 10,000, while others from 50 to 500), but staying on a single graph. We're looking to use this scale to see trends over time for several keys with varying values.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PMSI-AlignAlytics/dimple/issues/9/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PMSI-AlignAlytics/dimple/issues/9/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/d3/d3/issues/comments/70655955","html_url":"https://github.com/d3/d3/issues/1420#issuecomment-70655955","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/d3/d3/issues/1420","id":70655955,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDcwNjU1OTU1","user":{"login":"angiehjort","id":3648190,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2NDgxOTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3648190?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/angiehjort","html_url":"https://github.com/angiehjort","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/angiehjort/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/angiehjort/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/angiehjort/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/angiehjort/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/angiehjort/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/angiehjort/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/angiehjort/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/angiehjort/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/angiehjort/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-01-20T13:53:52Z","updated_at":"2015-01-20T13:54:10Z","body":"hi Mike @mbostock! i am trying to follow your hint [here](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/d3-js/QCOk9Or7vWI/YTh22CFFeY8J) and use a polylog scale:\n\n`scale = d3.scale.log().domain([-5.0, -0.1, 0.1, 100.0]).range([-200, 0, 0, 200]);`\n\nhere is what i get:\n\n`scale(-5)`\n-200 // looks fine, same for all values below -0\n\n`scale(5)`\nNaN // same for values -0, 0 and all values above\n\nI would expect it to go polylog and return values above 0.

Or to use a pow scale, or to otherwise avoid the problem.\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/d3/d3/issues/comments/70687865/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"mbostock","id":230541,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMDU0MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/230541?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock","html_url":"https://github.com/mbostock","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/d3/d3/issues/comments/70689414","html_url":"https://github.com/d3/d3/issues/1420#issuecomment-70689414","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/d3/d3/issues/1420","id":70689414,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDcwNjg5NDE0","user":{"login":"angiehjort","id":3648190,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2NDgxOTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3648190?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/angiehjort","html_url":"https://github.com/angiehjort","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/angiehjort/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/angiehjort/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/angiehjort/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/angiehjort/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/angiehjort/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/angiehjort/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/angiehjort/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/angiehjort/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/angiehjort/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-01-20T16:56:40Z","updated_at":"2015-01-20T16:56:40Z","body":"Thanks for the reply, Mike.

So ΔGDP. Now, if ΔGDP this year is zero (or 0 ± a little ε), then we leave the marker at zero, as simple as that. When it's negative we go negative. Even more interesting is that the marker can go \"continuously\" from positive to negative domain and back, as it happens in real life.\n\nSo i have to fake continuity and the part 0 ± ε where the strange thing happens. See how it was done in the [old version here](http://www.bit.ly/1ulYxky). Shift the time slider to see how the bubbles travel and may fall on zero.\n\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/3648190/5836926/fc424f56-a17a-11e4-832c-1043b4f62807.png)\n\nYes, we abuse the scale. We redefine the definition of \"logarithmic\"  near and below zero. Of a logarithm we just need a characteristic distortion on the rest of the axis.\n\nAgree with Mike's comment on that there should be a visible discontinuity on the scale to give a hint of that.\n\nPower scale would deliver a completely different picture (i tried different exponent values <1) and is not reflecting the nature of data correctly. Particularly i need to keep the fact that every 2x or 10x increase take the same space on the screen, and that is a log. \n\nSee log above and power below

The details will depend on what you want, but for example:\n\n``` js\nfunction myScale(x){\n  if (x === 0){\n    return 0;\n  }else{\n    return myRealScale(Math.abs(x))\n  }\n}\n```\n\nAlternatively, use clamping to force the value onto the domain:\n\n``` js\n> myScale = d3.scale.log().domain([1, 100])\n> myScale(0)\nNaN\n> myScale.clamp(true)\n> myScale(0)\n0\n```\n","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/d3/d3/issues/comments/132006369/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"mgold","id":1191970,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExOTE5NzA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1191970?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgold","html_url":"https://github.com/mgold","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgold/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgold/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgold/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgold/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgold/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgold/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgold/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgold/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgold/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/d3/d3/issues/comments/132376673","html_url":"https://github.com/d3/d3/issues/1420#issuecomment-132376673","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/d3/d3/issues/1420","id":132376673,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEzMjM3NjY3Mw==","user":{"login":"angiehjort","id":3648190,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2NDgxOTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3648190?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/angiehjort","html_url":"https://github.com/angiehjort","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/angiehjort/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/angiehjort/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/angiehjort/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/angiehjort/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/angiehjort/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/angiehjort/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/angiehjort/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/angiehjort/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/angiehjort/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-08-18T22:36:29Z","updated_at":"2015-12-11T21:32:29Z","body":"@kylebrandt
