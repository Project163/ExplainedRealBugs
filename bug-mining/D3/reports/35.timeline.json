believe it was originally implemented as returning an RGB string because previously some of the colors didn't return an RGB string when coerced. Since that was changed by cc0ae766b7d44adf47be4511d79577b59f9ef057 (#333), it should be safe and more useful for the color interpolators to return an instance of the appropriate color

#1029. Previously, these interpolators returned RGB hexadecimal strings, as the intent was for the color to be used to set attributes and styles. However, since #333, all colors return RGB hexadecimal strings when coerced to a string, so we can get the equivalent behavior by returning a color instance rather than a string. Returning a color instance is also more useful in the case where additional color manipulation (such as brighter/darker) is desired.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/d3/d3/issues/1359/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/d3/d3/issues/1359/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":55140426,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDU1MTQwNDI2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/d3/d3/issues/events/55140426","actor":{"login":"mbostock","id":230541,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMDU0MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/230541?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock","html_url":"https://github.com/mbostock","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"e5f7208131fdc099fada0627ed307653c95611ef","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/d3/d3/commits/e5f7208131fdc099fada0627ed307653c95611ef","created_at":"2013-07-03T16:58:16Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":55411351,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDU1NDExMzUx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/d3/d3/issues/events/55411351","actor":{"login":"mbostock","id":230541,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMDU0MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/230541?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock","html_url":"https://github.com/mbostock","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"ce6526cfe3b70a8555bbb7b2f235af9c916d34a0","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/d3/d3/commits/ce6526cfe3b70a8555bbb7b2f235af9c916d34a0","created_at":"2013-07-05T18:18:14Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
