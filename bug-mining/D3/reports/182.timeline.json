problem occurs since updating from 3.3.3 to 3.3.4, and probably has something to do with 06e2077ff84a1db94b8e0d9274d4e5bfad82cd5d.\n\nI have a graph with an ordinal x-axis to which the user can add and remove items. Since the update to 3.3.4, after removing an item (and updating the domain to reflect this), the position of the ticks and labels on the x-axis don't update. However, the value of the labels and the position of the datapoints on the graph are updated correctly.\n\nrelevant code:\n\n``` javascript\nvar x = d3.scale.ordinal().rangePoints([0, width], 1);\nvar

I had to come up with a Vega chart that:\n- Positions the legend below the chart, and\n- Places the legend entries horizontally, not vertically\n\nI wrote and validated a custom Vega spec using the Vega online editor.\nHowever, when I used the same spec in my project, the legend entries were all placed on top of each other.\nUpon inspection, I found that the `transform` attributes of all `path` element had the same x value: \n\n```\ntransform=\"translate(0,25)\"\n```\n\nwhich obviously wasn't the case with the Vega online editor.\n\nDigging around a little more, I noticed that Vega online editor uses Vega v1.3.3 + D3 v3.2.7, whereas my project uses Vega v1.3.3 + D3 v3.4.3.\n\nAnd I found the following changes in D3 that seems to be causing this issue:\n- https://github.com/mbostock/d3/commit/113032bc977ec1d196280597b060e17083bda90d\n- https://github.com/mbostock/d3/commit/d6ca25e87daf2849b6494051ccab0bd289264088\n\nMore specifically, in my case, `scale(x)` function was returning `NaN`, and Vega in turn was setting it to `0`.\n\nWhen I changed my project to use D3 v3.2.7, the problem disappeared.\n\nIs this a known issue?\n\nI've also created an issue with Vega project just in case:\nhttps://github.com/trifacta/vega/issues/183\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/d3/d3/issues/1835/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/d3/d3/issues/1835/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
