seems to me that, since [this change](https://github.com/mbostock/d3/commit/392ded0820247224b549cad66053a604d5b02eb3), the selection is not removed if you use a mere \"end\" event.\n\nThis is because the callback provided in the each(\"end\", callback()) call replaces the default \"end\" event that remove() sets up.\n\nThe workaround is to use some \"end.blah\" event.\n\nThe fix is to amend d3_transitionPrototype.remove so it uses some private namespace.\n\nIt just took me 4 hours to find out, as I was upgrading from version 2.3.2 and my transitions were broken :-)\n\nNB: the [documentation](https://github.com/mbostock/d3/wiki/Transitions#wiki-each) should be updated, by the way.\n\nCheers.\n","closed_by":{"login":"mbostock","id":230541,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMDU0MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/230541?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock","html_url":"https://github.com/mbostock","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/d3/d3/issues/471/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/d3/d3/issues/471/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
