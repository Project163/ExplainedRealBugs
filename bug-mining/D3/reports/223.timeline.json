fix #1994/#1972: the d3.format bug where scientific notation values are corrupted by the locale thousands separator action (e.g. d3.format(',f')(1e42)) when the value representation does not contain a decimal point as well.\n- # 1994: ditto where scientific notation values are printed in format modes which 'usually do not print the value as a scientific number' but the machine has to due to the very tiny or huge value presented to d3.format to print (such as type='f')\n- tolerate the comma in the format spec for format types which do not use it (type=[boxX...]): see also next item\n- fix #1995 the type=n format: to match the documentation (n === ,g), the 'n' type should also use the same value formatter as 'g': that formatter differs noticably from the 'default formatter' when large/tiny numbers are printed.\n- tiny optimization: do not mix run-time types in the 'type' variable to help the JS JIT compilers' run-time type analysis (Chrome V8 et al) to produce optimized code: `type` is a string, `type_f` is the corresponding function.\n- Tests have been added to cover all situations as the bug(s) were discovered due to the combination of\n  - userland code constructing a user-driven d3.format string (which should tolerate simple 'illegal combinations' to simplify d3.format usage by not requiring the userland code to carry a rule matrix for filtering formats upon construction), and\n  - userland data including very large and very small numbers being fed to these d3.format-generated formatters.\n## Notes\n#1996:\n\nThe 'p' percent type/mode performs a multiplication resulting in the ubiquitous floating point inaccuracy issues (http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=103162.103163) rearing their ugly head: see the commented out test case\n\n```\n//assert.strictEqual(f(3.1415e42), \"3.1415e+44%\");  // x86: 3.1415000000000002e+44% -- floating point inaccuracy kicking in...\n```\n\nwhich has been 'tweaked' to circumvent the issue **for this particular test case** (i.e. the problem is not gone, it is simply hiding)\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/d3/d3/issues/1997/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/d3/d3/issues/1997/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":158432429,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDE1ODQzMjQyOQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/d3/d3/issues/events/158432429","actor":{"login":"jasondavies","id":31223,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxMjIz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/31223?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasondavies","html_url":"https://github.com/jasondavies","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasondavies/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasondavies/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasondavies/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasondavies/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasondavies/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasondavies/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasondavies/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasondavies/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasondavies/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"bd87db66e3cb3e4f718a263f0923ab8d83dd0dd9","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/d3/d3/commits/bd87db66e3cb3e4f718a263f0923ab8d83dd0dd9","created_at":"2014-08-28T14:35:16Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"actor":{"login":"jasondavies","id":31223,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxMjIz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/31223?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasondavies","html_url":"https://github.com/jasondavies","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasondavies/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasondavies/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasondavies/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasondavies/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasondavies/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasondavies/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasondavies/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasondavies/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jasondavies/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-08-28T14:36:03Z","updated_at":"2014-08-28T14:36:03Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/d3/d3/issues/2000","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/d3/d3","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/d3/d3/issues/2000/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/d3/d3/issues/2000/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/d3/d3/issues/2000/events","html_url":"https://github.com/d3/d3/pull/2000","id":41396935,"node_id":"MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0MjA0NDIzNTQ=","number":2000,"title":"Fix
