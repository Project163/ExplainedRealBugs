ticket follows a rabbit trail off of #1786\n\nBackstory: I'm using `d3.behavior.drag` basically as a cross-platform foundation (Pointer Events pull request planned ;-) for a feature that ends up being like `d3.svg.brush` but within HTML and would also love to have something even more generic for general touch wrapping.\n\nIt's clear that the intended use is more of a \"drag a target around\" than my use case (e.g. I'm having to fix up the origin so that I get locations _within_ the target rather than its parent) and for having a general multitouch handler there's some other missing/broken pieces. I'm wondering if this is \"in scope\" for d3.behavior.drag or maybe I should just be using [PointerEvents polyfill](https://github.com/Polymer/PointerEvents).\n\nOne of the \"core\" problems with d3.behavior.drag multitouch is that the touchend handler doesn't pay attention to which touch was ended. But that leads back to a few other assumptions: that the drag is meant to be called on a moveable child (rather than a brush-like parent situation, which would need to _distinguish_ between events from different fingers and has to manually fix up origin), that only one finger will \"touchstart\" at once, that \"touchcancel\" won't get called…\n\nKind of a laundry list, and don't mean to sound like I'm griping — for practical purposes once I worked around #1388 (which is not really the behavior's fault) it is working for my main case right now. Just trying to figure out what my long-term \"go-to\" tool should be for this stuff: d3.behavior.drag, PointerEvents polyfill, or make a third-party \"pointers behavior\" plugin…\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/d3/d3/issues/1793/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/d3/d3/issues/1793/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/d3/d3/issues/comments/38080265","html_url":"https://github.com/d3/d3/issues/1786#issuecomment-38080265","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/d3/d3/issues/1786","id":38080265,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM4MDgwMjY1","user":{"login":"natevw","id":265902,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2NTkwMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/265902?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/natevw","html_url":"https://github.com/natevw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/natevw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/natevw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/natevw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/natevw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/natevw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/natevw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/natevw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/natevw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/natevw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-03-19T17:17:44Z","updated_at":"2014-03-19T17:18:03Z","body":"Whoops, filed #1793 while you were fixing some of the tangential issues mentioned here.

is different from #1388. That issue is regarding the zoom behavior rather than the drag behavior, and it isn’t a bug as much as a gotcha that needs documentation; if you remove the element that was the target of a touchstart, you no longer receive touchmove and touchend events.

experiencing an issue with a tree graph based on: \n\nhttp://bl.ocks.org/robschmuecker/7880033\n\nI'm using chrome for android, but it also seems to happen in firefox for android. D3 version is 3.4.6.\n\nThe problem seems to occur when I start panning my layout with the first touch being over a node. When I add a second finger outside of the node (but inside the svg) and let go of the first touch, the zoom behavior stops working (except for doubletap zoom). The only way to get the zoom behavior back, is by starting it on the initial node, or manualy readding the svg.on('zoom', zoom).\n\nI think the problem is caused by the last touch event not having the same target as the initial touch.\nI've read some suggestions where pointer event are captured by an overlay to make sure everything has the same target, however I need my nodes to be clickable. \n\nUsing zoomstart and zoomend events to dynamically add an overlay doesn't seem to work because the overlay gets added at the first touch, so my nodes still aren't clickable.\n\nI managed to replicate the error in the above example, by pressing on the root node, placing my 2nd finger to the left of the graph and lifting my first finger.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/d3/d3/issues/1850/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/d3/d3/issues/1850/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
