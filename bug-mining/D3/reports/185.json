For example, if you have an exterior ring that is split into two exterior rings, this should be represented as:\n\nstream.polygonStart\nstream.lineStart\nstream.point …\nstream.lineEnd\nstream.polygonEnd\nstream.polygonStart\nstream.lineStart\nstream.point …\nstream.lineEnd\nstream.polygonEnd\n\nInstead, the clipExtent outputs:\n\nstream.polygonStart\nstream.lineStart\nstream.point …\nstream.lineEnd\nstream.lineStart\nstream.point …\nstream.lineEnd\nstream.polygonEnd\n\nSince the additional polygonEnd / polygonStart is missing, stream listeners might assume that the second line is an interior ring (a hole) rather than the second exterior ring of a multipolygon.\n","closed_by":{"login":"mbostock","id":230541,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMDU0MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/230541?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock","html_url":"https://github.com/mbostock","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/d3/d3/issues/1558/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/d3/d3/issues/1558/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
