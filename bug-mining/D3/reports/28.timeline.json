If you use a namespaced handler, then it's `this[\"__onmouseover.name\"]`.\n\nAnother thing you can do that's easy is to not use an anonymous function, and just call your function. For example:\n\n``` javascript\nd3.select(\"#sensor\").on(\"mouseover\", mouseover);\nd3.select(\"#actor\").transition().each(\"end\", mouseover);\n\nfunction mouseover() {\n  // do some stuff here\n}\n```\n\nLastly, issue #100 covers a request to trigger events on other objects, which would be another way of calling their event handlers. In this case, you could trigger a \"mouseover\" event on the desired elements, and all the associated event handlers would be run.\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/d3/d3/issues/comments/1532911/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"mbostock","id":230541,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMDU0MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/230541?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock","html_url":"https://github.com/mbostock","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":1671998,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDE2NzE5OTg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/d3/d3/issues/events/1671998","actor":{"login":"mbostock","id":230541,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMDU0MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/230541?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock","html_url":"https://github.com/mbostock","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2011-07-08T15:00:07Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/d3/d3/issues/comments/1544141","html_url":"https://github.com/d3/d3/issues/216#issuecomment-1544141","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/d3/d3/issues/216","id":1544141,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE1NDQxNDE=","user":{"login":"lanyjie","id":901955,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkwMTk1NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/901955?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lanyjie","html_url":"https://github.com/lanyjie","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lanyjie/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lanyjie/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lanyjie/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lanyjie/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lanyjie/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lanyjie/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lanyjie/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lanyjie/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lanyjie/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2011-07-11T03:23:12Z","updated_at":"2011-07-11T03:23:12Z","body":"Thanks, that surely solves my problem. I used a named function, but your code reads much better, I didn't realized that you can also modify the transition (created in mouseover function) by doing something like:\n\nd3.select(\"#actor\").transition().each(\"end\", mouseover);\n\nVery cool. I wonder if it is a good design to have the .on('mouseover') call to return the previously set mouseover handler? this works like the way of .attr() calls, sounds quite intuitive. Using this.__onmouseover is like working beneath the hood, which requires much knowledge of the implementation.\n","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/d3/d3/issues/comments/1544141/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"lanyjie","id":901955,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkwMTk1NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/901955?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lanyjie","html_url":"https://github.com/lanyjie","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lanyjie/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lanyjie/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lanyjie/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lanyjie/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lanyjie/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lanyjie/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lanyjie/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lanyjie/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lanyjie/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/d3/d3/issues/comments/1544197","html_url":"https://github.com/d3/d3/issues/216#issuecomment-1544197","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/d3/d3/issues/216","id":1544197,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE1NDQxOTc=","user":{"login":"mbostock","id":230541,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMDU0MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/230541?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock","html_url":"https://github.com/mbostock","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2011-07-11T03:46:26Z","updated_at":"2011-07-11T03:46:26Z","body":"Yeah,
