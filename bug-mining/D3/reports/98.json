However, lines at 90° longitude extend all the way to the poles.\n\nOne way to support this functionality might be to distinguish between the _major_ extent and the _minor_ extent, and likewise the _major_ step and the _minor_ step. The default _minor_ extent could be [[-180, -80], [180, 80]], while the default _major_ extent could be [[-180, -90], [180, 90]]. Likewise the default _minor_ step could be 22.5, and the default _major_ step 90. The implementation would need to make sure that major lines that coincide with minor lines (as will happen by default) are not duplicated in the returned lines.\n","closed_by":{"login":"mbostock","id":230541,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMDU0MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/230541?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock","html_url":"https://github.com/mbostock","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/d3/d3/issues/1009/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/d3/d3/issues/1009/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
