pull request fixes a long standing bug (#443) by making polygon.clip work on closed polygons; previously it only worked on open polygons. The other polygon methods, area and centroid, already work on both open and closed polygons.\n\nThis pull request also changes d3.geom.polygon to use a prototype rather than creating every method as a closure. This will potentially break callers that assumed polygon methods were bound to the object instance, but this was never documented as an API guarantee so I am comfortable making this change in a patch release. (Also, the majority of examples using polygon.clip should now be using the more-convenient voronoi.clipExtent.)\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/d3/d3/issues/1345/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/d3/d3/issues/1345/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":54800123,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50NTQ4MDAxMjM=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/d3/d3/issues/events/54800123","actor":{"login":"mbostock","id":230541,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMDU0MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/230541?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock","html_url":"https://github.com/mbostock","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":"5596e4fbc3dd02a32344ecfec3fbd2b6aa7eb226","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/d3/d3/commits/5596e4fbc3dd02a32344ecfec3fbd2b6aa7eb226","created_at":"2013-07-01T18:12:47Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
