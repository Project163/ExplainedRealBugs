I tried quite a few but all failed. for example, I would like to blink a path by repeatedly call the same transition function: \n\nd3.select('#sensor')\n   .on('mouseover', function(){ \n           d3.select('#actor')\n                 .transition()\n                 .each('start', function(){d3.select(this).attr('stroke-width',1); })\n                 .attr('stroke-width', 4).delay(1000)\n                 .each('end', function(){ this.onmoueover(); })\n\nThe intention of the above code is to recursively call the function set by the on() method. Is there anyway to get it done? I also tried to use selection.on('mouseover') to access the set function, without luck.\n\nRegards,\n\nLane\n","closed_by":{"login":"mbostock","id":230541,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMDU0MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/230541?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock","html_url":"https://github.com/mbostock","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbostock/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/d3/d3/issues/216/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/d3/d3/issues/216/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
