-If a *count* is specified instead of an array of *thresholds*, then the [domain](#bin_domain) will be uniformly divided into approximately *count* bins; see [ticks](./ticks.md).
+If *thresholds* is specified as a function, the function will be passed three arguments: the array of input [*values*](#bin_value) derived from the data, and the [domain](#bin_domain) represented as *min* and *max*. The function may then return either the array of numeric thresholds or the count of bins; in the latter case the domain is divided uniformly into approximately *count* bins; see [ticks](./ticks.md#ticks). For instance, you might want to use time ticks when binning time-series data; see [example](https://observablehq.com/@d3/d3-bin-time-thresholds).
