+    works together with hbase.client.scanner.max.result.size to try and use the
+    network efficiently. The default value is Integer.MAX_VALUE by default so that
+    the network will fill the chunk size defined by hbase.client.scanner.max.result.size
+    rather than be limited by a particular number of rows since the size of rows varies
+    table to table. If you know ahead of time that you will not require more than a certain
+    number of rows from a scan, this configuration should be set to that row limit via
+    Scan#setCaching. Higher caching values will enable faster scanners but will eat up more
+    memory and some calls of next may take longer and longer times when the cache is empty.
