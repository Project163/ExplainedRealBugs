+    <description>The load balancer can trigger for several reasons. This value controls one of
+      those reasons. Run the balancer if any regionserver has a region count outside the range of
+      average +/- (average * slop) regions.
+      If the value of slop is negative, disable sloppiness checks. The balancer can still run for
+      other reasons, but sloppiness will not be one of them.
+      If the value of slop is 0, run the balancer if any server has a region count more than 1
+      from the average.
+      If the value of slop is 100, run the balancer if any server has a region count greater than
+      101 times the average.
+      The default value of this parameter is 0.2, which runs the balancer if any server has a region
+      count less than 80% of the average, or greater than 120% of the average.
+      Note that for the default StochasticLoadBalancer, this does not guarantee any balancing
+      actions will be taken, but only that the balancer will attempt to run.</description>
