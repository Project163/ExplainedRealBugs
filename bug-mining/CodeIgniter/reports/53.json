I need to ensure that certain controllers always use SSL, and so wrote a helper function to force it:\n\n``` php\nif(!function_exists('force_https')) {\n    /**\n     * If the current request isn't over https, perform an\n     * HTTP 301 redirect.\n     */\n    function force_https() {\n        if(!isset($_SERVER['HTTPS']))\n            redirect(str_replace('http:', 'https:', current_url()), 'location', 301);\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThis works like a charm.  However, I quickly discovered that forms that appear in these controllers weren't working.  The form action was often defined using current_url(), or site_url($some_uri_string), or merely $some_uri_string.  All of these URIs get processed through $CI->config->site_url().  The problem is, this function //always// builds URIs beginning with http.  In the case of forms, POSTed data is lost during the redirect.\n\nTo get around this I overwrote current_url() like so, and changed all the form actions to use it:\n\n``` php\nif(!function_exists('current_url')) {\n    /**\n     * Overwrite the default, since it does not account for https.\n     */\n    function current_url() {\n        $_ci =& get_instance();\n        $url = $_ci->config->site_url($_ci->uri->uri_string());\n\n        if(isset($_SERVER['HTTPS']) && $_SERVER['HTTPS'] != 'off')\n            $url = substr($url, 0, 4) . 's' . substr($url, 4);\n\n        return $url;\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThis works, but ideally a developer wouldn't have to do this.  Ignoring the possibility of https seems like a major oversight for CodeIgniter's core URI-string resolver.  It ought to be easy to switch between http and https and vice versa.\n","closed_by":{"login":"philsturgeon","id":67381,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY3Mzgx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/67381?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/philsturgeon","html_url":"https://github.com/philsturgeon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philsturgeon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philsturgeon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philsturgeon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philsturgeon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philsturgeon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philsturgeon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philsturgeon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philsturgeon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philsturgeon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bcit-ci/CodeIgniter/issues/165/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bcit-ci/CodeIgniter/issues/165/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
