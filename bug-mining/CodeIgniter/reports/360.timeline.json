was unable to come up with a way to fix various Pagination library issues through multiple pull requests. Since a few issues are closely related in how they interact with each other, separating them was tedious, and I ended up starting over repeatedly. I'll document everything here as best as possible for future reference.\n\n---\n\nOne bug unmentioned so far is the inconsistent handling of the first URL -- in most scenarios, the `< First` link did not match the links for page one, or `Previous` when it pointed to page one. That is fixed in this update.\n\nHere's a list of everything modified in the Pagination library, in roughly top to bottom order, to help follow the diff:\n1. Moved the `_parse_attributes()` call into the `if` check to see if any attributes have been set. No point in calling it if none exist. _No related bug._\n2. Moved the `$this->num_links` check to the top of the method. Anything that will error out should be checked as soon as possible. _No related bug._\n3. `reuse_query_string` is now checked first, and a `$get` array is put together of any existing values. This array will be used to generate the appropriate query strings in a bit, including the query string for page numbers. _Part of fix for #2166 & inconsistent handling of query strings._\n4. `base_url` and `first_url` are then sanitized / assigned.\n   - If `page_query_string = TRUE` and `first_url` is empty, the first URL inherits the base URL, and reused query strings when applicable. `per_page` is then appended to the base_url only. _Part of fix for #2166 & inconsistent handling of query strings._\n   - For segment-based URLs, any reused query strings are appended after the page number and any user-defined suffix. (Prefixes and suffixes are not used for the first URL. _See: #1414_)\n   - If the `first_url` config option is ever set by the dev, it will be used as-is; no query strings or prefix/suffix will be added.\n5. `Pagination::$uri_segment` is set to `0`, and the method defaults to the number of the last URI segment from `URI::segment_array()`. _Fixes: #2124, #1909; Discussed: #2166 (which is now outdated)_\n6. The `Render the Pages` part was reorganized a bit, remove some unnecessary nested `if`'s and whatnot.\n7. A bunch of comment updates, for both grammar and prevent redundancy.\n\n---\n##### Related:\n- CI's `$config['url_suffix']` is not used at all by the class, and I'm not sure if it should (see #1887). First, it could mean weird URLs. If you have _ci.dev/controller/method.html_, you could end up with any of these depending on how things were set up:\n  - ci.dev/controller/method.html/10\n  - ci.dev/controller/method/10.html\n  - ci.dev/controller/method.html/10.html\n  \n  A lot of this boils down to developer preference. And since you can generate suffixed URLs easily with the pagination library, I'd consider it a non-issue for the time being. Making the class play nice with CI's suffix brings in a whole new ball game.\n- Language files (see #1589) -- I'm not overly concerned with implementing this now, but I think it's a good idea. It makes i18n a little easier, and prevents needing to pass the language through all the config options upon init.\n\n---\n\nI did my best to throw whatever use cases I could think of at this. In some situations it did produce some funny results, but it was usually because things like `page_query_string` and `suffix` were mixed together - a _highly_ unlikely scenario that anyone would want that, and similar to using CI's suffix, a pain in the ass to \"fix\". Testing is always appreciated -- you should be able to throw this into a 2.1.x application and have it work out of the box (at least I think so). With a lot of rearranging like this, a bug is probably inevitable. Let's squash it early, yo.\n\nIf this looks good and doesn't have any arguments, I will update the documentation and change log to accompany it.\n\nCheers! :beers:\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bcit-ci/CodeIgniter/issues/2199/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bcit-ci/CodeIgniter/issues/2199/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bcit-ci/CodeIgniter/issues/comments/12833976","html_url":"https://github.com/bcit-ci/CodeIgniter/issues/1887#issuecomment-12833976","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bcit-ci/CodeIgniter/issues/1887","id":12833976,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEyODMzOTc2","user":{"login":"narfbg","id":1058011,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNTgwMTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1058011?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg","html_url":"https://github.com/narfbg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2013-01-29T13:18:38Z","updated_at":"2013-01-29T13:18:38Z","body":"@cryode, you've mentioned this in #2199, but I don't want to further spam the discussion in there.
