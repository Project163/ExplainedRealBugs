I did a lot of digging and found that it is actually a problem with the glibc implementation of iconv()... which is found on most servers, versus the libiconv implementation which runs on most localhost settings, making it difficult to replicate.\n\nI just added a pull request here, let me know what you think...

You might be right about the OPs opening of this issue, I've read the latest comment of him and he addresses your direction. However:\n\nTechnically spoken: You can not tell which character is illegal or not if the encoding of the input string is undefined. So easy and clear.\n\nIf you signal `iconv` that the input _is_ UTF-8 but it's not, I would not expect that `iconv` let it pass. It looks like that PHP 5.4 finally does this properly by entirely not further on re-encode the input string. [Check the test with PHP 5.4](http://codepad.viper-7.com/Lgm4Vp). The result looks like it properly does not re-encode anything as the input was invalid (the only way to find out is to actually check for the warning or comparing string length of the input and output, as long as input had length but output has not, you can assume that the input was invalid, well that's a bit short but I think you get the idea).\n\nThe `//IGNORE` parameter however is only for the output encoding. That means: If (and only if) _the input is correctly encoded_, `iconv` can (and only then can) change it to _another_ encoding. If then the output encoding can not encode a code-point that is available in the input encoding, it will be dropped. `//IGNORE` is only a flagging on how to deal with missing code-points in the output encoding  (and that's [documented](http://php.net/manual/en/function.iconv.php)).\n\nSo rule of thumb: `//IGNORE` is about output encoding, **not** input encoding. The `//IGNORE` therefore is not in action at all yet. The warning is prior re-encoding. The warning is about checking the input and it's charset. If reported broken (not UTF-8), prior to PHP 5.4, it just did so assuming it's UTF-8. But that's violating the unicode standards and considered bad practice (an argument hard to ignore). You can't build proper computer systems with such defects. Gladly this has been fixed in PHP 5.4 and the input string is not used for re-encoding any longer.\n\nI myself did misread this in the beginning as well. The notice is about the _input_ encoding (and not the output encoding). As we can already see in the warning that the input to the function is invalid, you can not expect that you get **any** result (even you did get results because of defects in the underlying routines of the software in PHP 5.2 and 5.3).\n\nSo maybe it's worth to actually talk about the concrete problems how they are visible to us: We have some input into our application and assume it's UTF-8. Now the warning tells us it's not. So it can't be hardly CI's job to fix your application. Please ensure that you always correctly process your applications input based on the concrete encoding the input data comming into your application is properly reflected.\n","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bcit-ci/CodeIgniter/issues/comments/1984276/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"ktomk","id":352517,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1MjUxNw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/352517?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ktomk","html_url":"https://github.com/ktomk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ktomk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ktomk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ktomk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ktomk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ktomk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ktomk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ktomk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ktomk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ktomk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":2948675,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50Mjk0ODY3NQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bcit-ci/CodeIgniter/issues/events/2948675","actor":{"login":"tgriesser","id":154748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1NDc0OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/154748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgriesser","html_url":"https://github.com/tgriesser","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgriesser/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgriesser/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgriesser/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgriesser/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgriesser/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgriesser/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgriesser/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgriesser/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgriesser/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2011-09-02T23:00:38Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bcit-ci/CodeIgniter/issues/comments/1984656","html_url":"https://github.com/bcit-ci/CodeIgniter/issues/261#issuecomment-1984656","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bcit-ci/CodeIgniter/issues/261","id":1984656,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE5ODQ2NTY=","user":{"login":"tgriesser","id":154748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1NDc0OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/154748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgriesser","html_url":"https://github.com/tgriesser","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgriesser/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgriesser/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgriesser/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgriesser/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgriesser/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgriesser/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgriesser/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgriesser/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgriesser/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2011-09-03T00:27:15Z","updated_at":"2011-09-03T00:27:15Z","body":"@ktomk: Since CI runs everything through this function at runtime by default, based on the application wide `$config['charset'] = 'UTF-8';` setting it _is_ actually using the function as a fuzzy input filter to make sure that the incoming string is UTF-8 encoded by the time it hits the controller...and it isn't helpful if the string is truncated without throwing any sort of warning as to why.\n\nExample: A POST is sent to a controller containing an illegal character and input is truncated at the beginning of the string (or just dropped entirely in php5.4 as you noted).
