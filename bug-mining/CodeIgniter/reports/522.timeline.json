Before I look in to this further, can you clarify your statement: \"Yes, this is a bug\"?\r\n\r\nWell, as I said, that `ini_set()` call is supposed to improve error reporting (i.e. actually show the possibly erroneous `save_path` in the error message generated by PHP, because it's otherwise just an internal property of `CI_Session` and PHP has no knowledge of it). This is explained by `_fail()`'s docblock.\r\nIf it generates an extra `E_WARNING`, that's a bug because it's not what was intended.\r\n\r\n> I guessed you either assumed a session wouldn't be open (hence my comment) or didn't realise this was forbidden.\r\n\r\nThat would be the latter, but it's not as simple as that ...\r\n\r\nObviously, there's people for whom the `E_WARNING` doesn't appear; you're the first one to report it. Then also, that line was added way before PHP 7.2 was released (probably before it entered development at all), so it may be a new thing. And finally, #5715 shows that even on 7.2 it may not appear, so it may be the case that only a very specific set of conditions trigger the error.\r\n\r\n> To clarify also the failure function is triggered because of a failure to write here: https://github.com/bcit-ci/CodeIgniter/blob/3.1-stable/system/libraries/Session/drivers/Session_database_driver.php#L226\r\n>\r\n> Could you move the ini_set to before the session_start perhaps?\r\n\r\nI could and that's the obvious fix that I'm thinking about, but with all the strangeness around this issue, I want to know the cause first. Otherwise, we might simply hide another error that would continue to lurk somewhere and cause other problems in the future.\r\n\r\nAnd we may've just found it - the line you pointed to is a \"failure to obtain lock\" condition, which is more of a refuse-to-write than a straight write failure. It's a decent safeguard, but not meant to be triggered - a lock is supposed to be obtained in `read()` and I just now notice that `CI_Session_database_driver::read()` never triggers a failure to lock error.\r\n\r\nCan you test what happens if you change https://github.com/bcit-ci/CodeIgniter/blob/0e59db6c207b3108565ef4ab6c18b81353478d91/system/libraries/Session/drivers/Session_database_driver.php#L191 to this:\r\n\r\n    } else { return $this->_failure; }\r\n\r\n@hyxj1220 Are you using the database driver? And how sure are you that you have the exact same error? Excuse my doubting you, but a lot of the short \"I have the same problem\" replies we get are false, by people who see a *similar* but different error message, under different conditions.\r\n\r\nAlso, that a single request doesn't trigger the error is irrelevant.

does.","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bcit-ci/CodeIgniter/issues/comments/473264483/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"narfbg","id":1058011,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNTgwMTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1058011?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg","html_url":"https://github.com/narfbg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":2206284488,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MjIwNjI4NDQ4OA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bcit-ci/CodeIgniter/issues/events/2206284488","actor":{"login":"hyxj1220","id":3364537,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzNjQ1Mzc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3364537?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hyxj1220","html_url":"https://github.com/hyxj1220","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hyxj1220/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hyxj1220/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hyxj1220/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hyxj1220/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hyxj1220/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hyxj1220/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hyxj1220/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hyxj1220/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hyxj1220/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-03-15T12:18:51Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2206284489,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDIyMDYyODQ0ODk=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bcit-ci/CodeIgniter/issues/events/2206284489","actor":{"login":"hyxj1220","id":3364537,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzNjQ1Mzc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3364537?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hyxj1220","html_url":"https://github.com/hyxj1220","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hyxj1220/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hyxj1220/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hyxj1220/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hyxj1220/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hyxj1220/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hyxj1220/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hyxj1220/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hyxj1220/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hyxj1220/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-03-15T12:18:51Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bcit-ci/CodeIgniter/issues/comments/473347043","html_url":"https://github.com/bcit-ci/CodeIgniter/issues/5703#issuecomment-473347043","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bcit-ci/CodeIgniter/issues/5703","id":473347043,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ3MzM0NzA0Mw==","user":{"login":"jamieburchell","id":3270426,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyNzA0MjY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3270426?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jamieburchell","html_url":"https://github.com/jamieburchell","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jamieburchell/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jamieburchell/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jamieburchell/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jamieburchell/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jamieburchell/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jamieburchell/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jamieburchell/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jamieburchell/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jamieburchell/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-03-15T16:10:54Z","updated_a
