At first it looks easy, but then I started thinking about other things.

For example, one of the languages available in Bonfire is properly represented by the language tag `es-419`, which is \"Spanish as used in Latin America\" (http://www.w3.org/International/articles/language-tags/), which would be appropriate for many of the countries which use Spanish as their primary language, but not for Spain itself (unless there are no other options).\n\nI didn't pursue it further because I didn't see any activity here, and I was looking at a potentially complicated replacement for the language code which would have to be maintained parallel to the CI code.\n","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bcit-ci/CodeIgniter/issues/comments/62742159/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"mwhitneysdsu","id":1537529,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1Mzc1Mjk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1537529?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mwhitneysdsu","html_url":"https://github.com/mwhitneysdsu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mwhitneysdsu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mwhitneysdsu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mwhitneysdsu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mwhitneysdsu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mwhitneysdsu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mwhitneysdsu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mwhitneysdsu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mwhitneysdsu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mwhitneysdsu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bcit-ci/CodeIgniter/issues/comments/62752332","html_url":"https://github.com/bcit-ci/CodeIgniter/issues/674#issuecomment-62752332","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bcit-ci/CodeIgniter/issues/674","id":62752332,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYyNzUyMzMy","user":{"login":"jim-parry","id":3203951,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyMDM5NTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3203951?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jim-parry","html_url":"https://github.com/jim-parry","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jim-parry/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jim-parry/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jim-parry/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jim-parry/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jim-parry/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jim-parry/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jim-parry/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jim-parry/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jim-parry/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-11-12T17:00:18Z","updated_at":"2014-11-12T17:00:18Z","body":"Agreed - not as simple a problem as it might appear at first glance!\n\nThe current CI approach is underkill, the official PHP approach (http://php.net/manual/en/book.intl.php) is overkill for a lightweight framework.

Another example: I need language (human) names in order to make a language switcher.\n\nThis is why it seems to me that the current language identifiers - 'english', 'bulgarian', ... etc. are equally good to 'en', 'bg', ... etc. The simple change 'english' -> 'en' does not add value, it does not worth the efforts. I think, you may stick to the current choice.\n","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bcit-ci/CodeIgniter/issues/comments/62758560/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"ivantcholakov","id":1438104,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MzgxMDQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1438104?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivantcholakov","html_url":"https://github.com/ivantcholakov","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivantcholakov/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivantcholakov/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivantcholakov/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivantcholakov/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivantcholakov/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivantcholakov/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivantcholakov/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivantcholakov/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivantcholakov/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bcit-ci/CodeIgniter/issues/comments/62769394","html_url":"https://github.com/bcit-ci/CodeIgniter/issues/674#issuecomment-62769394","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bcit-ci/CodeIgniter/issues/674","id":62769394,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYyNzY5Mzk0","user":{"login":"Razican","id":597469,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5NzQ2OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/597469?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Razican","html_url":"https://github.com/Razican","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Razican/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Razican/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Razican/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Razican/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Razican/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Razican/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Razican/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Razican/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Razican/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-11-12T18:45:49Z","updated_at":"2014-11-12T18:45:49Z","body":"Maybe for a future version it could be great to support complete i18n.

This strikes me as well beyond what CodeIgniter is trying to tackle, now and for the foreseeable future.\n\nWhat we do have is multiple language support. A number of organizations are involved with the standards (ISO, W3C, IETF), and the codes that are expected.\n\nCI call its language code an \"idiom\", which does not imply conformance to a standard, but it doesn't preclude it either. However, the \"idiom\" values are only allowed to be alphabetic. If that validation rule, in core/lang, were changed to allow digits and a hyphen somewhere in the middle, then the existing tool could be used for our current practice, e.g. \"english\", as well as the IETF variants, e.g. \"en-us\".\n\nThat would solve one bone of contention in this discussion.\n\nAnother issue here is the name of the folder holding language-specific settings. Given that we are using an \"idiom\", and that the current convention (languages/idiom/x_lang.php) is CI-centric, I think we should leave things the way they are. There is nothing to stop someone from renaming their \"english\" folder to \"en\", and changing the language default in config/config.\n\nI have a suggestion to make that might be an improvement and help to address some of the concerns ... we could implement cascading language files, perhaps load_cascaded(...) where the idiom can be an array. If \"english,en,en-us\", then the \"english\" values could be selectively replaced by the \"en\" ones, which could be selectively replaced by the \"en-us\" ones. It seems to me that this would help some of the problems raised.
