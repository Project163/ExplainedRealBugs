Thanks to this parser vulnerability, user can view any data available to view component on page with shown data which were edited by him. Simple made up  (not tested but you get the idea) example:\n\nSQL table users:\n\n| name | ban_note |\n| --- | --- |\n| Dude Dudette | This user is asshole, he fucked my GF |\n\nController:\n\n``` php\n$this->parser->parse('view', $this->db->get('users')->row_array());\n```\n\nView:\n\n``` php\nHi, {name}\n<?\nif ($ban_note) \n   echo '. Unfortunately, you violated our rules and you can\\'t access this section';\n?>\n```\n\nOutput of view is: `Hi, Dude Dudette. Unfortunately, you violated our rules and you can't access this section`\n\nNow, user will change his name to `{ban_note}`\n\nSQL table users now is:\n\n| name | ban_note |\n| --- | --- |\n| {ban_note} | This user is asshole, he fucked my GF |\n\nAnd View output is: `Hi, This user is asshole, he fucked my GF. Unfortunately, you violated our rules and you can't access this section`\n\nUser would not have this ability if developer did not choose CodeIgniter's Parser, therefore it's bug of the CodeIgniter's Parser.\n","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bcit-ci/CodeIgniter/issues/comments/52774732/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"ostrolucky","id":496233,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5NjIzMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/496233?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ostrolucky","html_url":"https://github.com/ostrolucky","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ostrolucky/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ostrolucky/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ostrolucky/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ostrolucky/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ostrolucky/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ostrolucky/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ostrolucky/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ostrolucky/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ostrolucky/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bcit-ci/CodeIgniter/issues/comments/52811766","html_url":"https://github.com/bcit-ci/CodeIgniter/issues/3189#issuecomment-52811766","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bcit-ci/CodeIgniter/issues/3189","id":52811766,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUyODExNzY2","user":{"login":"narfbg","id":1058011,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNTgwMTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1058011?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg","html_url":"https://github.com/narfbg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-08-20T17:27:11Z","updated_at":"2014-08-20T17:27:11Z","body":"I see ...

CodeIgniter developers,\n\nI noticed a few known security vulnerabilities (CVE-numbers) that apply to the CodeIgniter project (official CPE name cpe:/a:codeigniter:codeigniter).\n\nFor **cpe:/a:codeigniter:codeigniter:1.5.3** are four registered CVE reports:\n- CVE-2007-3709\n- CVE-2007-3708\n- CVE-2007-3707\n- CVE-2007-3706\n\nFor **cpe:/a:codeigniter:codeigniter:1.7.2** is just one known security report: \n- CVE-2011-3719.\n\n**Source:**\nhttp://www.cvedetails.com/vulnerability-list/vendor_id-6918/product_id-11625/Codeigniter-Codeigniter.html\n\nI read some CVE related posts and I noticed that the value of a CVE database is not always appreciated or understood. Source:\n- https://github.com/bcit-ci/CodeIgniter/issues/1702\n- https://github.com/bcit-ci/CodeIgniter/issues/3174\n\nNevertheless I'm wondering why there are not more CVE's reported so far. I've been pretty active in following the CodeIgniter development and noticed last years that some security bugs have been fixed but are never reported to the CVE database.\n\nI'm happy that CodeIgniter is an open-source project and like to contribute to that. Especially using my IT security expertise. For that reason I'd like to work out some CVE reports about different security bugs in previous versions that are currently fixed. This way there will be a clear and open view about the amount of security vulnerabilities per version and hopefully this will encourage the developers who didn't upgrade, to upgrade to the latest version of CodeIgniter. \n\nFor people who are unfamiliar to this world. In comparison and as an example this are the CVE lists of some other PHP frameworks and WordPress.\n\n**Yii:**\nhttp://www.cvedetails.com/vulnerability-list/vendor_id-13516/product_id-28088/Yiiframework-Yiiframework.html\n\n**Zend:**\nhttp://www.cvedetails.com/vulnerability-list/vendor_id-5025/product_id-18532/Zend-Framework.html\n\n**Symfony:**\nhttp://www.cvedetails.com/vulnerability-list/vendor_id-11981/product_id-22402/Sensiolabs-Symfony.html\n\n**WordPress:**\nhttp://www.cvedetails.com/vulnerability-list/vendor_id-2337/product_id-4096/Wordpress-Wordpress.html\n\nI'd like to hear some thoughts about this and especially I'm wondering if I should just work out some PoC's and just submit the bugs to the CVE database, or to discuss those bugs here before submitting them, just to make sure. Any thoughts?\n\n_Also I'm working on a small concept for the same purpose. To try to detect the used CodeIgniter version on a website or application. https://github.com/Calico90/codeigniter-version-scanner_
