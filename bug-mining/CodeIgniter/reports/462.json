I tested the same server setup without using codeigniter and it works fine:\n\n<pre>\nini_set('session.save_handler', 'memcached');\nini_set('session.save_path', 'tcp://10.126.1.17:11211');\n\nsession_start();\n\n$_SESSION['foo'] = 'bar';\n$_SESSION['time'] = time();\n\nvar_dump($_SESSION);\n</pre>\n\n\nFor cache there are no delays but the data is never stored. In the code below both var_dumps output bool(false):\n\n<pre>\npublic function test() {\n$this->load->driver('cache', array(\n    'adapter' => 'memcached', \n    'backup' => 'file'\n));\n\nvar_dump($this->cache->get('foo'));\n$this->cache->save('foo', 'test test', 300);\nvar_dump($this->cache->get('foo'));\n}\n</pre>\n\n","closed_by":{"login":"narfbg","id":1058011,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNTgwMTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1058011?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg","html_url":"https://github.com/narfbg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bcit-ci/CodeIgniter/issues/3919/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bcit-ci/CodeIgniter/issues/3919/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
