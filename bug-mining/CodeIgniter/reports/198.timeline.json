It's true that anyone who knows basic regular expressions can easily introduce whatever functionality they need without the wildcard replacement. As someone who has used (:any) - knowing what it actually does - and taken advantage of it in some places, I guess I'm mostly arguing for not breaking existing applications.\n\nAt the same time, I see the confusion between the user guide and the real functionality, and would like to see that resolved. It almost seems as though the easiest fix is to just update the docs to accurately reflect what (:any) has always done.\n\nIf we were to change (:any) and add one more wildcard, I suppose I'd have to go change existing apps anyway, so I'm not sure it really makes a difference to me. But, those who don't really know regex may appreciate at least having an alternative to switch their routes to if they had relied on the multi-segment capturing. For them, and for a degree of improved readability over (.+), I will offer another name suggestion for what (:any) has historically done - how about (:everything)?

fly.)\n","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bcit-ci/CodeIgniter/issues/comments/9774596/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"dchill42","id":630484,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzMDQ4NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/630484?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dchill42","html_url":"https://github.com/dchill42","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dchill42/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dchill42/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dchill42/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dchill42/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dchill42/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dchill42/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dchill42/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dchill42/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dchill42/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":27767804,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50Mjc3Njc4MDQ=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bcit-ci/CodeIgniter/issues/events/27767804","actor":{"login":"narfbg","id":1058011,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNTgwMTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1058011?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg","html_url":"https://github.com/narfbg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2012-10-25T11:48:16Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":27767805,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDI3NzY3ODA1","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bcit-ci/CodeIgniter/issues/events/27767805","actor":{"login":"narfbg","id":1058011,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNTgwMTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1058011?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg","html_url":"https://github.com/narfbg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2012-10-25T11:48:16Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bcit-ci/CodeIgniter/issues/comments/9775112","html_url":"https://github.com/bcit-ci/CodeIgniter/issues/658#issuecomment-9775112","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bcit-ci/CodeIgniter/issues/658","id":9775112,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDk3NzUxMTI=","user":{"login":"narfbg","id":1058011,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNTgwMTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1058011?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg","html_url":"https://github.com/narfbg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2012-10-25T12:09:40Z","updated_at":"2012-10-25T12:09:40Z","body":"@dchill42 I agree on the backwards-compatibility issue, but what is written in the docs is the intentional behavior - (:any) is supposed to match a (part of a) segment, not multiple segments. If it doesn't do what it's indended to do, then we have a bug and we need it to be fixed.\n\nPeople who don't have knowledge of regexp will follow the user guide, because that's their ONLY guide unless they learn how to use regular expressions. If the docs say `(.+)`, then they'll write `(.+)` without questioning it and granted - most of them will forget it right after they do their configuration.\nBut chances are that a person unfamiliar with regular expressions will also forget `(:any)` or any other alias, simply because they are not used to the concept of using patterns. And for those who will learn - they will most likely learn basic regexp rules as well.\n\nPlus, while it is indeed a framework's job to make development easier, that should not be done by replicating or aliasing native functionalities 1-to-1. Following this principle, I wouldn't care about the readability of `(.+)` vs. `(:any)`, `(:all)`, etc.\n","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bcit-ci/CodeIgniter/issues/comments/9775112/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"narfbg","id":1058011,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNTgwMTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1058011?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg","html_url":"https://github.com/narfbg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":27769249,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50Mjc3NjkyNDk=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bcit-ci/CodeIgniter/issues/events/27769249","actor":{"login":"dchill42","id":630484,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzMDQ4NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/630484?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dchill42","html_url":"https://github.com/dchill42","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dchill42/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dchill42/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dchill42/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dchill42/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dchill42/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dchill42/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dchill42/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dchill42/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dchill42/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2012-10-25T12:09:40Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":27769250,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDI3NzY5MjUw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bcit-ci/CodeIgniter/issues/events/27769250","actor":{"login":"dchill42","id":630484,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzMDQ4NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/630484?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dchill42","html_url":"https://github.com/dchill42","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dchill42/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dchill42/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dchill42/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dchill42/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dchill42/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dchill42/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dchill42/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dchill42/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dchill42/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2012-10-25T12:09:40Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
