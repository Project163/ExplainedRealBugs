If the given method doesn't exist, then I assume youtube id and so on.\n\nThe problem is that in the `Uri::_validate_request`, it will replace dashes with underscores which is an awesome feature. However, in my _remap, I wanted the pure youtube id passed in, not a youtube id that had the dashes replaced with underscores. There were two things I could have done to fix this issue. I could have just grabbed `uri::segments` OR in the system/Codigniter.php I could have changed this code\n\n```\n    if (method_exists($class, '_remap'))\n    {\n        $params = array($method, array_slice($URI->rsegments, 2));\n        $method = '_remap';\n    }\n```\n\nto this\n\n```\n    if (method_exists($class, '_remap'))\n    {\n        $params = array_slice($URI->segments, 1);\n        $method = '_remap';\n    }\n```\n\nI ended up doing the latter because it made more sense to me that on a remap you get the actual uri string passed in and not something that has been str_replaced. I don't know if you guys would consider this an issue of if this is the desired behavior of the routing.\n\nThanks\n","closed_by":{"login":"narfbg","id":1058011,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNTgwMTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1058011?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg","html_url":"https://github.com/narfbg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bcit-ci/CodeIgniter/issues/2503/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bcit-ci/CodeIgniter/issues/2503/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
