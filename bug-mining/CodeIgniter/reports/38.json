Their strlen() reads wrong and they wont be matched as parenthesis by regex.\n\nThe reason for this is in system/core/URI.php at lines 238-241. Why would the parenthesis be replaced by shitty HTML entities that damage the string ?\n\n``` php\n// Convert programatic characters to entities\n$bad    = array('$',        '(',        ')',        '%28',      '%29');\n$good   = array('&#36;',    '&#40;',    '&#41;',    '&#40;',    '&#41;');\nreturn str_replace($bad, $good, $str);\n```\n\nUnless there's a good reason for it, I think this replacement should be removed altogether. You don't want to know how many hours it took me to pinpoint this issue.\n\nWith love,\n\nAntoine Gersant\n","closed_by":{"login":"narfbg","id":1058011,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNTgwMTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1058011?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg","html_url":"https://github.com/narfbg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bcit-ci/CodeIgniter/issues/47/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bcit-ci/CodeIgniter/issues/47/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
