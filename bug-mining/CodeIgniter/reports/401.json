When the developer used this `increment_string` with a dynamic (user customizable) string and this string is not properly escaped, code injection is possible and a potentially ReDoS can be caused.\n\nI would recommend to use PHP's `preg_quote` function to mitigate this vulnerability. \nLine 256 in file `system/helpers/string_helper.php` should be:\n`preg_match('/(.+)' . preg_quote($separator) . '([0-9]+)$/', $str, $match);`\n\nAlso without the use of `preg_quote` it's not possible to call this `increment_string` function with one of the following delimiters `. \\ + * ? [ ^ ] $ ( ) { } = ! < > | : -`\n\n---\n\nThis vulnerability seem to exists since CodeIgniter versions 2.1.0 and higher and also applies to stable releases 2.2.0 and 3.0.0.\n\n_When this fix is pushed to the next stable release, I'll request a CVE number for this vulnerability and assign it to this issue on GitHub._ Also I will prepare a pull request for this fix.\n\n_Generic information about ReDoS can be found here:_\n- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ReDoS\n- https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Regular_expression_Denial_of_Service_-_ReDoS\n","closed_by":{"login":"JaneX8","id":5116641,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxMTY2NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5116641?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JaneX8","html_url":"https://github.com/JaneX8","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JaneX8/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JaneX8/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JaneX8/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JaneX8/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JaneX8/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JaneX8/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JaneX8/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JaneX8/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JaneX8/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bcit-ci/CodeIgniter/issues/4023/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bcit-ci/CodeIgniter/issues/4023/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
