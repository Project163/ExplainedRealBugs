But this is the opposite.\n\nThe correct escaping order:\n# escaping LIKE condition wildcards\n# escaping strings with database escaping api\n\n== Example: ==\n\nstrings in database(2 records)\n# \\xxxfoo456\n# \\%foo456\n\nIf you want to search strings begining with \\%foo,\n{{{\n# !php\n\n```\n    $orig = '\\%foo';\n    $string = $this->db->escape_like_str($orig);\n    $sql = \"SELECT content\n            FROM mytable\n            WHERE content LIKE '$string%';\";\n```\n\n}}}\n\nand it must hit 1 record, but 2 records hit.\n\nIf you want to search strings begining with \\,\n{{{\n# !php\n\n```\n    $orig = '\\\\';\n    $string = $this->db->escape_like_str($orig);\n    $sql = \"SELECT content\n            FROM mytable\n            WHERE content LIKE '$string%';\";\n```\n\n}}}\n\nand it must hit 2 records, but 0 record hits.\n\nTest code: https://bitbucket.org/kenjis/cir_test/changeset/d69099543e37\n\nFix: see attached patch file.\n","closed_by":{"login":"narfbg","id":1058011,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNTgwMTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1058011?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg","html_url":"https://github.com/narfbg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bcit-ci/CodeIgniter/issues/136/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bcit-ci/CodeIgniter/issues/136/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
