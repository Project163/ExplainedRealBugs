I was able to hack it in by changing line 180 of the mysqli/mysqli_forge.php from \n\n``` php\n$sql .= \"\\n) DEFAULT CHARACTER SET {$this->db->char_set} COLLATE {$this->db->dbcollat};\";\n```\n\nto \n\n``` php\n$sql .= \"\\n) ENGINE=InnoDB DEFAULT CHARACTER SET {$this->db->char_set} COLLATE {$this->db->dbcollat};\";\n```\n\nbut thats an ugly hack. Perhaps something like\n\n``` php\n$this->dbforge->set_table_type('InnoDB');\n```\n\n``` php\nif ( ! $this->db->table_exists('my_innodb_table'))\n{\n\n    // Setup Keys\n    $this->dbforge->add_key('id', TRUE);\n\n    $this->dbforge->add_field(array(\n        'id' => array('type' => 'INT', 'constraint' => 5, 'unsigned' => TRUE, 'auto_increment' => TRUE),\n        'account_id' => array('type' => 'INT', 'constraint' => '5', 'unsigned' => TRUE, 'null' => FALSE),\n        'category_id' => array('type' => 'INT', 'constraint' => '5', 'unsigned' => TRUE, 'null' => FALSE),\n    ));\n    $this->dbforge->add_field(\"CONSTRAINT FOREIGN KEY (account_id) REFERENCES accounts(id)\");\n\n    // NEED SUPPORT FOR SOMETHING LIKE THIS \n    $this->dbforge->set_table_type('InnoDB');\n\n    $this->dbforge->create_table('categories', TRUE);\n}\n```\n\nI know foreign key support is a pain, but it's easily done with \n\n``` php\n$this->dbforge->add_field(\"CONSTRAINT FOREIGN KEY (account_id) REFERENCES accounts(id)\");\n```\n\nnow we just need support for InnoDB to really make migrations useful. \n","closed_by":{"login":"philsturgeon","id":67381,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY3Mzgx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/67381?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/philsturgeon","html_url":"https://github.com/philsturgeon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philsturgeon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philsturgeon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philsturgeon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philsturgeon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philsturgeon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philsturgeon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philsturgeon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philsturgeon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philsturgeon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bcit-ci/CodeIgniter/issues/41/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bcit-ci/CodeIgniter/issues/41/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
