Here's a part of it. \n\n# The problem\n\nOk, so as explained above the set_select() function checks the full post-array for each select box and can not differentiate between the different select boxes if you use arrays as field names.\n\nThe post-array contains the following array for select boxes with an array as field name, the name of this array is ofc the same as the name of the select box:\n\n``` php\n\nArray\n(\n    [0] => value1\n    [1] => value2\n    [2] => value3\n    [3] => value4\n)\n```\n\nKey 0 contains the selected value from the first select box, key 1 the second, and so on....\n\nThe current set_select() function uses all values in the post-array for each select box, so if you select value4 in the 4th select box it will be selected in all the select boxes! So, the set_select() function somehow needs to know which key in the post-array should be used for which select box. It can't use the name of the select box because obviously they are the same if you use an array as field name :) \n\n# The theoretical solution\n\nMy idea was to add an extra, optional, argument to the set_select() function. This extra argument passes an integer to the function which is only used if we are dealing with an array. The integer you pass must equal the key in the post-array you want this set_select() to use to determine which value should be set as selected. So if you are using set_select() on your first select box the integer passes should be 0, on your second select box it should be 1, and so on.... Now the set_select() function does know which key should be used and is able to set the correct value as selected for all your select boxes with an array as field name, YAY!\n\nMy fix continues to work for normal field names, it doesn't require any code updates for anyone but it does give us the opportunity to properly work with re-population with arrays as field names! HTML will look like this:\n\n``` html\n\n<select name=\"myselect[]\">\n  <option value=\"one\" <?php echo set_select('myselect[]', 'one', TRUE, 0); ?> >One</option>\n  <option value=\"two\" <?php echo set_select('myselect[]', 'two', FALSE, 0); ?> >Two</option>\n  <option value=\"three\" <?php echo set_select('myselect[]', 'three', FALSE, 0); ?> >Three</option>\n</select> \n\n<select name=\"myselect[]\">\n  <option value=\"one\" <?php echo set_select('myselect[]', 'one', TRUE, 1); ?> >One</option>\n  <option value=\"two\" <?php echo set_select('myselect[]', 'two', FALSE, 1); ?> >Two</option>\n  <option value=\"three\" <?php echo set_select('myselect[]', 'three', FALSE, 1); ?> >Three</option>\n</select> \n```\n\nA pull request will be provided soon!\n","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bcit-ci/CodeIgniter/issues/comments/1920167/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"basv","id":946871,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk0Njg3MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/946871?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/basv","html_url":"https://github.com/basv","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/basv/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/basv/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/basv/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/basv/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/basv/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/basv/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/basv/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/basv/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/basv/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":2763940,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDI3NjM5NDA=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bcit-ci/CodeIgniter/issues/events/2763940","actor":{"login":"basv","id":946871,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk0Njg3MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/946871?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/basv","html_url":"https://github.com/basv","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/basv/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/basv/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/basv/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/basv/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/basv/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/basv/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/basv/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/basv/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/basv/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2011-08-27T15:47:12Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bcit-ci/CodeIgniter/issues/comments/1923299","html_url":"https://github.com/bcit-ci/CodeIgniter/issues/35#issuecomment-1923299","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bcit-ci/CodeIgniter/issues/35","id":1923299,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE5MjMyOTk=","user":{"login":"magicleaves","id":1008294,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMDgyOTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1008294?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/magicleaves","html_url":"https://github.com/magicleaves","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/magicleaves/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/magicleaves/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/magicleaves/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/magicleaves/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/magicleaves/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/magicleaves/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/magicleaves/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/magicleaves/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/magicleaves/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2011-08-28T10:06:08Z","updated_at":"2011-08-28T10:06:08Z","body":"Thank you.
