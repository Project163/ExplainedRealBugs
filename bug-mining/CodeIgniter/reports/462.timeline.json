Therefore, when the driver then runs the `setTimeout` function on that key, it returns 0, which triggers a failure in the `session_write_close` handler.\n\nTherefore, my fix is to simply not set a timeout when the session fingerprint is equal to that of a blank session - as soon as some session data is added, the code runs as it originally did.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bcit-ci/CodeIgniter/issues/4424/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bcit-ci/CodeIgniter/issues/4424/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bcit-ci/CodeIgniter/issues/comments/180527031","html_url":"https://github.com/bcit-ci/CodeIgniter/issues/3919#issuecomment-180527031","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bcit-ci/CodeIgniter/issues/3919","id":180527031,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE4MDUyNzAzMQ==","user":{"login":"yahyaerturan","id":1583263,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODMyNjM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1583263?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yahyaerturan","html_url":"https://github.com/yahyaerturan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yahyaerturan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yahyaerturan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yahyaerturan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yahyaerturan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yahyaerturan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yahyaerturan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yahyaerturan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yahyaerturan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yahyaerturan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-02-05T19:49:41Z","updated_at":"2016-02-05T19:49:41Z","body":"I am using memcached for session handling and cache purposes.
