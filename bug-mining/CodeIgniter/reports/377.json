Regular expression checking failed. Because unwanted '/' after starting #. Maybe typo.\n2. list_files() returns array of only files and folders name. Not the path. So Recursive function argument will be $filepath.$lish[$i] and ftp_delete() path will $filepath.$lish[$i].\n3. Final Solution is \n   if ( ! preg_match('#..?$#', $list[$i]) && ! @ftp_delete($this->conn_id, $filepath.$list[$i]))\n   {\n   $this->delete_dir($filepath.$list[$i]);\n   }\n","closed_by":{"login":"narfbg","id":1058011,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNTgwMTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1058011?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg","html_url":"https://github.com/narfbg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bcit-ci/CodeIgniter/issues/3787/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bcit-ci/CodeIgniter/issues/3787/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
