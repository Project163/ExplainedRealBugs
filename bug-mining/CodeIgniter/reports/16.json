My extension uses dirty hack with substituting $_FILES contents and calling do_upload(), but that's the best way I can think of (duplicating whole class or just do_upload() is much worse).\r\n\r\nMaybe that feature is important enough to add to CI, or maybe someone would just find my code useful, so here it is:\r\n\r\n```php\r\n# !php\r\n\r\n<?php \r\nclass MY_Upload extends CI_Upload {\r\n\r\nprivate $multiple_upload_data = array();\r\n\r\n/**\r\n * Perform multiple file upload\r\n *\r\n * @return  bool\r\n */\r\npublic function do_multiple_upload($field = 'userfile[]')\r\n{\r\n    $files = $_FILES; // we would change $_FILES so we need a copy\r\n    $flag = false; // flag indicates if at least one upload was successful\r\n    $fld = substr($field, 0, strlen($field)-2); // cutting out '[]' at the end\r\n    for($i = 0; $i < count($files[$fld]['name']); $i++) { // for each file\r\n        // setting up $_FILES so it looks like we uploaded single file\r\n        foreach($files[$fld] as $attr => $values) {\r\n            $_FILES[$fld][$attr] = $values[$i];\r\n        }\r\n        // performing upload and updating flag\r\n        $res = $this->do_upload($fld);\r\n        $flag = $flag || $res;\r\n        // saving upload's data (it can later be fetched using get_data()\r\n        array_push($this->multiple_upload_data, $this->data());\r\n    }\r\n    return $flag;\r\n}\r\n\r\n// --------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n/**\r\n * Returns data about all uploaded files as data() method does\r\n *\r\n * @return  array\r\n */\r\npublic function get_data()\r\n{\r\n    return $this->multiple_upload_data;\r\n}\r\n\r\n// --------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n}\r\n\r\n?>\r\n```\r\n\r\nThank you for developing Code Igniter!\r\n","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bcit-ci/CodeIgniter/issues/173/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bcit-ci/CodeIgniter/issues/173/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
