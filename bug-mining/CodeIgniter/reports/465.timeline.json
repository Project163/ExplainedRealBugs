morning!\n\nHaving downloaded & tested 3.0.5 - there's no problem. Attachment appears should, at 257 _Kilobytes_ with the contents intact & un-corrupted. Made a couple of changes to the code at thread start to make sure the `filesize` is of a suspected size & `$mail->attach()` is separated into it's on `if()` statement, just to make sure it's not failing. \n\nSecondly, I realised it wasn't very helpful publishing the headers; as it's the boundaries of the multi-part data that's the important thing here, which there's been subtle changes between `3.0.5` & `3.1.0`. (Should there be a newline after `Content-Transfer-Encoding: base64` on `3.1.0`?). The charset is cased differently, however I do specify that at the email config. \n\nAs for the Email Client, I'm using **Outlook 2010** & **Outlook.com Webmail** which both had the same issue. \n\nI have tested this with my gmail and it is correctly showing the PDF intriguingly.

3.1.0\n\nThere is an issue which occurs in `/system/libraries/Email.php` on line `1471` when you add attachments to an email and none of them have a `Content-ID`.\n\nWhen there is a Content-ID specified the resulting message looks something like this:\n\n```\nContent-Type: image/jpeg; name=\"test.jpg\"\nContent-Disposition: inline;\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: base64\nContent-ID: <test.jpg@57a0a6e46acfc>\n\n/9j/4AAQSkZJRgABAQEBLAEsAAD/4QCqRXhpZgAATU0AKgAAAAgACQEaAAUAAAABAAAAegEbAAUA\nAAABAAAAggEoAAMAAAABAAMAAAExAAIAAAAQAAAAigMBAAUAAAABAAAAmgMDAAEAAAABAAAAAFEQ\nAAEAAAABAQAAAFERAAQAAAABAAAuIlESAAQAAAABAAAuIgAAAAAAAczvAAAD6AABzO8AAAPocGFp\n```\n\nHowever, when there us no Content-ID specified (i.e. not an inline attachment) then the message looks something like this:\n\n```\nContent-Type: image/jpeg; name=\"test.jpg\"\nContent-Disposition: attachment;\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: base64\n/9j/4AAQSkZJRgABAQEBLAEsAAD/4QCqRXhpZgAATU0AKgAAAAgACQEaAAUAAAABAAAAegEbAAUA\nAAABAAAAggEoAAMAAAABAAMAAAExAAIAAAAQAAAAigMBAAUAAAABAAAAmgMDAAEAAAABAAAAAFEQ\nAAEAAAABAQAAAFERAAQAAAABAAAuIlESAAQAAAABAAAuIgAAAAAAAczvAAAD6AABzO8AAAPocGFp\n\n```\n\nTake note that now there is no blank line between the attachment headers and content.\n\nBecause the blank line is missing the email seems to appear corrupted when read - I do not know why this happens. I have tested with IIS SMTP Server and MS Exchange Servers 2010 and 2013.\n\nSimply adding in the blank line seems to fix the issue so I changed line `1471` from\n\n`.(empty($this->_attachments[$i]['cid']) ? '' : 'Content-ID: <'.$this->_attachments[$i]['cid'].'>'.$this->newline.$this->newline)`\n\nto\n\n`.(empty($this->_attachments[$i]['cid']) ? '' : 'Content-ID: <'.$this->_attachments[$i]['cid'].'>'.$this->newline).$this->newline`\n\nI hope this helps someone.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bcit-ci/CodeIgniter/issues/4746/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bcit-ci/CodeIgniter/issues/4746/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"actor":{"login":"narfbg","id":1058011,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNTgwMTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1058011?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg","html_url":"https://github.com/narfbg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-08-04T16:26:06Z","updated_at":"2016-08-04T16:26:06Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bcit-ci/CodeIgniter/issues/4747","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bcit-ci/CodeIgniter","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bcit-ci/CodeIgniter/issues/4747/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bcit-ci/CodeIgniter/issues/4747/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bcit-ci/CodeIgniter/issues/4747/events","html_url":"https://github.com/bcit-ci/CodeIgniter/issues/4747","id":169412560,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWUxNjk0MTI1NjA=","number":4747,"title":"3.1.0

After examining the message code, I've noticed the difference from other messages with working attachments, and that was a missing newline between the attachment headers and base64 content. As soon as I added a newline character to Email system library, attachment started to working correctly, so please examine this, and apply a patch where appropriate.\n\nThe issue with a solution is available here as well\nhttp://stackoverflow.com/questions/25416585/codeigniter-send-email-with-attach-file\n\nTemporary fix (or maybe a final as well?) is the following. At line 725 of Email, function _attach()_, there should be a \"\\r\\n\" newline character, as displayed below:\n\n``` php\n# system/libraries/Email.php, line 725\n'content'   => \"\\r\\n\" . chunk_split(base64_encode($file_content)),\n```\n\nBest!\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bcit-ci/CodeIgniter/issues/4817/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bcit-ci/CodeIgniter/issues/4817/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bcit-ci/CodeIgniter/issues/comments/252860022","html_url":"https://github.com/bcit-ci/CodeIgniter/issues/4739#issuecomment-252860022","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bcit-ci/CodeIgniter/issues/4739","id":252860022,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI1Mjg2MDAyMg==","user":{"login":"miethek","id":4234150,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyMzQxNTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4234150?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/miethek","html_url":"https://github.com/miethek","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miethek/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miethek/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miethek/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miethek/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miethek/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miethek/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miethek/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miethek/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miethek/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-10-11T09:32:07Z","updated_at":"2016-10-11T09:32:07Z","body":"Adding extra \"$this->newline\" works for me.\nWas:\n.
