I'll post this in the forums, too.\n\nI'm testing the 3.0.6 release and came across this error on all of my pages that use the Memcached caching driver.\n\nSymptom: release 3.0.6 of CodeIgniter added a destructor to the Cache_memcached.php driver that calls close() (if using the memcache) or quit() (if using memcached.) If you use a sufficiently old version  of the memcached PECL extension (such as EPEL's php-pecl-memcached RPM for RHEL6) then you will get this error message.\n\nCause: the quit() method was not added to the memcached PECL extension until version 2.0.0.\n","closed_by":{"login":"narfbg","id":1058011,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNTgwMTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1058011?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg","html_url":"https://github.com/narfbg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bcit-ci/CodeIgniter/issues/4562/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bcit-ci/CodeIgniter/issues/4562/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
