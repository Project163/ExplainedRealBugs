We had been including `.pdf` documents within our emails for a year now. For various purposes, on  CodeIgnitier versions `3.0.4` & `3.0.0` prior to that. Our initial code hadn't changed and we started to receive 'blank' `.PDFs`, they were successfully attached however, it seems the contents were empty; corrupted and/or unsuccessfully included to the Email when being attached in Outlook.\n\nI managed to produce a test case for this below, of which if you do spot a possible mistake, please let me know:\n\n``` php\n<?php\n/**\n * \n */\nclass SandboxCI extends CI_Controller {\n\n    /**\n     * \n     */\n    public function __construct()\n    {\n        parent::__construct();\n    }\n\n    /**\n     * \n     */\n    private function get_pdf_path()\n    {\n        $file_path = FCPATH .
