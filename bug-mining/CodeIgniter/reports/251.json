Until I figured form_validation was \"escaping\" data upon running.\nWhy is that? Isn't it just supposed to check data?\n\nThe worst thing in that is that it's not using htmlentities or htmlspecialchars but it's using prep_for_form which is a simple : \nreturn str_replace(array(\"'\", '\"', '<', '>'), array(\"&#39;\", \"&quot;\", '&lt;', '&gt;'), stripslashes($data));\n\nAfter all I read I don't think that's enough, and I can't use form_validation + htmlentites since it's causing double escaping.\n\nAny thoughts on that?\n","closed_by":{"login":"narfbg","id":1058011,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNTgwMTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1058011?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg","html_url":"https://github.com/narfbg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bcit-ci/CodeIgniter/issues/2230/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bcit-ci/CodeIgniter/issues/2230/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
