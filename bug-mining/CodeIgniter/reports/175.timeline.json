inspection and audit of the session library. Some of the session checks are indeed inadequate and a bit outdated way of doing things (ip check, user agent check), to say the least.\n\nI do try to keep an eye on issues with the session library, because of my interest out of participating in the commit by @dchill42 to split the session library out into drivers. However, CodeIgniter is currently largely build by enthousiasts so it's difficult to assign the issues you raised to someone to go and build the required security enhancements.\n\nThat being said, and since you seem to have dived into the innards of CI for inspecting these issues, it would really help if you could fork CI on github and implement some of the security suggestions you mention into a commit.\n\nThanks in

The CI docs could point to a possible solution to use a custom encryption library X or Y.\n2. Rook, you described something about cypher_noise being inadequate. Please recap.\n3.
