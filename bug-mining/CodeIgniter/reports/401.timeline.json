I appreciate the direct approach. \"Saying that this is any kind of a vulnerability is like saying that preg_match() itself is vulnerable and needs a CVE ID assigned\" is a not really the right comparison since it does affect the parameter of a CodeIgniter function and the parameter itself is obviously injectable. Also I don't like it myself when everything is labeled as a vulnerability but as i mentioned \"When the developer used this increment_string with a dynamic (user customizable) string and this string is not properly escaped...\" it's applies indeed on a quite custom (maybe unlikely) scenario and that makes it a LOW risk severity in my opinion. \n\nI'm fine with leaving the CVE on this, altough I think that this actually will classify for a CVE. That the parameter is misused of it's purpose doesn't mean it's not vulnerable. The whole purpose of IT security is doing unexpected stuff to stuff that expects the expected. Anyway, let's forget about the CVE on this one. \n\nAbout the public disclosure, since this is an open-source project. This would be the right place in my opinion to discuss such stuff. I'm not aware of another channel to discuss this with the development team, is there? \n\n_A bit off-topic: A Bug Bounty program on HackerOne could be nice and helpful. Researchers often hack for credits not just for money. On that platform are multiple open-source projects without cash bounties._\n\n_About the PR, I thought so already just found it out the hard way. Sorry!_\nLet's close this one and eventually continue in the PR

\"Saying that this is any kind of a vulnerability is like saying that preg_match() itself is vulnerable and needs a CVE ID assigned\" is a not really the right comparison since it does affect the parameter of a CodeIgniter function and the parameter itself is obviously injectable.\n\nYes, it's an obviously exaggerated comparison that I made, but I still stand at my rationale behind it. The fact that it's a parameter in a CodeIgniter function doesn't mean anything ... frameworks have primitives too, not everything is to be used with user input and this one is deffinately not.\n\nWe do have a private channel - our security@ email is in the readme file (and I just mentioned it to you in the other thread :)); and most open-source projects do, solely for accepting reports on security issues.\n\nNo worries on the PR thing, it happens to many.\n\nEdit: And thanks for the HackerOne suggestion, I didn't know there were non-cash bounty programs - I'll surely look into that. :)\n","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bcit-ci/CodeIgniter/issues/comments/127757904/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"narfbg","id":1058011,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNTgwMTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1058011?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg","html_url":"https://github.com/narfbg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bcit-ci/CodeIgniter/issues/comments/127767251","html_url":"https://github.com/bcit-ci/CodeIgniter/issues/4023#issuecomment-127767251","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bcit-ci/CodeIgniter/issues/4023","id":127767251,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEyNzc2NzI1MQ==","user":{"login":"JaneX8","id":5116641,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxMTY2NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5116641?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JaneX8","html_url":"https://github.com/JaneX8","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JaneX8/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JaneX8/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JaneX8/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JaneX8/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JaneX8/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JaneX8/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JaneX8/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JaneX8/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JaneX8/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-08-04T21:26:38Z","updated_at":"2015-08-04T21:26:38Z","body":"@narfbg No problem.
