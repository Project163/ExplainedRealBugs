something. \n(my system is not using 3rd party smtp client like 'sendmail', but using code igniter build-in smtp client)\n\nEven _send_command(...) function get error from server, the error will not be propagated to upper logic.(_send_with_smtp() function return false only when It got error on transferring email body)\n\nHave a good
