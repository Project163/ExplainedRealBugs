And I like to think that I do have great attention to detail, but I too can miss something - hence why I left the issue open.\r\n\r\nThen comes the question of **unvalidated, unsanizitzed user input to a library that is not made for that**. Seriously, who sends emails with a user-supplied `From` header? Especially without a single check on the input? Should I also take the blame for pointing that out instead of spending 5 hours on it?\r\n\r\nAnd finally (and I noticed this now), apparently somebody has thought even of that, long before I've joined the project - the library has a `validate` option, which turns on email address validation and would prevent your example from working.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThe thing in `CI_Upload` was changed because of #1494, and that probably was a bad decision indeed.
