I looked for the cause of the problem on the file system/libraries/pagination.php and I think I found it.\n\nI saw that there are two calls to the method initialize that calls  _parse_attributes. Every time  _parse_attributes is called the value of the variable _attributes is set to empty. \n\nSo, on the first call of the method the variable $this->_attributes will have the value class=item.\nBut on the second call, $this->_attributes will be set to empty.\n\nThe method create_links make use of  $this->_attributes to set the attributes, but it will be empty.\n\nThe expected result is\n`<a href=\"\" class=\"item\">1</a>`\n\nBut I got\n`<a href=\"\">1</a>`\n\nApparent solution:\nI removed the line 670 of the file system/libraries/pagination.php and it worked perfectly. The line I referer is this one (in the method _parse_attributes):\n`$this->_attributes = '';`\n\nThe following line is not affected because PHP will know it's a string. \n`$this->_attributes .= ' '.$key.'=\"'.$value.'\"';\n`\n\nThanks guys. \n","closed_by":{"login":"narfbg","id":1058011,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNTgwMTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1058011?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg","html_url":"https://github.com/narfbg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bcit-ci/CodeIgniter/issues/4454/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bcit-ci/CodeIgniter/issues/4454/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
