On looking through the code for the text_watermark() method in Image_lib.php, I find:\n\n{{{\n# !php\n\n$fontwidth  = $this->wm_font_size-($this->wm_font_size/4);\n$fontheight = $this->wm_font_size;\n$this->wm_vrt_offset += $this->wm_font_size;\n}}}\n\nOn my develoment system, I've replaced this with the following using the php imagettfbbox function to determine the boundaries of the text.  It seems to give a much more accurate result.\n\n{{{\n# !php\n\n$wm_text_box = imagettfbbox($this->wm_font_size,0,$this->wm_font_path,$this->wm_text);\n$wm_text_width = $wm_text_box[2] - $wm_text_box[0];\n$wm_text_height = $wm_text_box[1] - $wm_text_box[7];\n$fontheight = $wm_text_height;\n$fontwidth = $wm_text_width/strlen($this->wm_text);\n$this->wm_vrt_offset += $fontheight;\n}}}\n","closed_by":{"login":"narfbg","id":1058011,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNTgwMTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1058011?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg","html_url":"https://github.com/narfbg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bcit-ci/CodeIgniter/issues/43/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bcit-ci/CodeIgniter/issues/43/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
