cashing a part of a query, and then runs 3 different get() on the cached part.\n\nFirst thing I came across was that where_in() didn't calculated the cached where(), and because of this didn't added prefix 'AND'. I solved this by adding a check for cached where() in where_in(), like this:\n`$prefix = (count($this->qb_where) === 0 && count($this->qb_cache_where) === 0) ? $this->_group_get_type('') : $this->_group_get_type($type);`\nThis seems to solve the problem.\n\nThe next problem, which I have not been able to solve, is regarding groups in where clause.\nI'm using the cache once again (don't know if thats relevant) and adds this:\n\n```\n$this->db->group_start();\nforeach ($chosen_price_ranges as $i => $value){\n    $this->db\n        ->or_group_start()\n            ->where( array( 'price >=' => $price_range_low[ $value ], 'price <=' => $price_range_high[ $value ] ) )\n        ->group_end();\n}\n$this->db->group_end();\n```\n\nThis works fine with one loop, and produces:\n`AND ( (`price`>=0 AND`price`<=0 ) )` \n\nBut with two iterations it produces (with a missing end parantes):\n`AND ( (`price`>=0 AND`price`<=0 ) OR (`price`>= 1 AND`price`<= 10 )`\n\nAnd with three iterations it produces (with a lot of missing parantes):\n`AND ( (`price`>=0 AND`price`<=0 ) OR (`price`>= 1 AND`price`<= 10`price`>= 11 AND`price`<= 30 )`\n\nI found this in group_end():\n`'condition' => str_repeat(' ', $this->qb_where_group_count--).')',`\nI don't understand why it is adding extra spaces depending on number of open where groups? But it may be irrelevant to this question.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bcit-ci/CodeIgniter/issues/4038/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bcit-ci/CodeIgniter/issues/4038/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":382467609,"node_id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDM4MjQ2NzYwOQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bcit-ci/CodeIgniter/issues/events/382467609","actor":{"login":"narfbg","id":1058011,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNTgwMTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1058011?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg","html_url":"https://github.com/narfbg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2015-08-14T11:10:54Z","label":{"name":"Bug","color":"e10c02"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":382467621,"node_id":"MDE1Ok1pbGVzdG9uZWRFdmVudDM4MjQ2NzYyMQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bcit-ci/CodeIgniter/issues/events/382467621","actor":{"login":"narfbg","id":1058011,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNTgwMTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1058011?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg","html_url":"https://github.com/narfbg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"milestoned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2015-08-14T11:10:56Z","milestone":{"title":"3.0.1"},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
