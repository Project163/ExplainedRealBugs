Since there is no specific `form_image()` function in CodeIgniter, I use the `form_input()` function. It works like it should (`<?=form_input(array('type' => 'image', 'name' => 'test', 'alt' => 'test', 'src' => 'test.png'));?>`), but also automatically adds the `value=\"\"` attribute, which creates [invalid HTML](http://www.w3.org/TR/html-markup/input.image.html).\nSo, I would suggest to either implement a check to omit the `value` attribute if the type is `image`, create an own `form_image()` function or specify a specific value for `value`, such as `'value' => NULL` in `form_input()` which causes the function to omit the `value` attribute.\n\nIt should also be noted that input `type=\"image\"` requires the use of an `alt` attribute, so, if omitted it should be addeed automatically (`alt=\"\"`).\n","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bcit-ci/CodeIgniter/issues/comments/13646626/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"rieschl","id":3321556,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzMjE1NTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3321556?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rieschl","html_url":"https://github.com/rieschl","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rieschl/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rieschl/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rieschl/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rieschl/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rieschl/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rieschl/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rieschl/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rieschl/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rieschl/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":54649792,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDU0NjQ5Nzky","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bcit-ci/CodeIgniter/issues/events/54649792","actor":{"login":"nonchip","id":601018,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYwMTAxOA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/601018?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nonchip","html_url":"https://github.com/nonchip","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nonchip/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nonchip/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nonchip/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nonchip/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nonchip/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nonchip/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nonchip/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nonchip/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nonchip/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"67bc8a451285a705a923a92aa41e15c01788b2b4","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nonchip/CodeIgniter/commits/67bc8a451285a705a923a92aa41e15c01788b2b4","created_at":"2013-06-29T18:43:10Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
