If I am using CodeIgniter for every context i.e., Standard HTML, URL, Attribute and Script context and attacker is able to inject the above line then the above injection will bypass attribute and URL context e.g., If you will input the above line in the following demo that has CodeIgniter Protection in all context:\n\nhttp://xssplayground.net23.net/clean10.html\n\nand if you will bring your mouse pointer over the attribute and URL context, you will see XSS alert box (Tested in Firefox).\n\nI haven't read the documentation regarding the goal of CodeIgniter. Is it ONLY for HTML-context? If yes, then you can ignore the above bypass. Just to explain my point, in case of htmLawed, I found the following line in their documentation: http://www.bioinformatics.org/phplabware/internal_utilities/htmLawed/htmLawed_README.htm#s2.8\n\n\"htmLawed is meant for input that goes into the body of HTML documents.\" \n\nIf this is also the case with CodeIgniter then you may ignore but please mention somewhere that this is sort of limitation that CodeIgniter only works in STANDARD HTML CONTEXT.\n\nI hope it

@DaveMC08 I have just found another bypass of CodeIgniter. In order to reproduce this bypass, make sure TURN-OFF XSS Auditor in Chrome (see this: http://peter.sh/experiments/chromium-command-line-switches/#disable-xss-auditor). The bypass is specific to Chrome browser:\n\nIn CodeIgniter code at one point you guys are checking for link so that you can remove malicious JS links:\n\n`if (preg_match('/<a/i', $str))\n            {\n                $str = preg_replace_callback('#<a\\s+([^>]*?)(?:>|$)#si', array($this, '_js_link_removal'), $str);\n            }`\n\nThe above RE expects there would be an SPACE after anchor tag but forward slash (/) is perfectly legit and links works.\n\ne.g., `<a/href= ...` would bypass this RE in CodeIgniter. Now I show you the XSS vector:\n\n`<a/href\f[\\0C]=ja&Tab;vasc&Tab;ript&colon;confirm(1)>XXX</a>`  \n\n// [\\0C] stands for FORM FEED and it works in chrome. see http://jsfiddle.net/23sqP/\n\nIn the above vector, I am using HTML5 entities so that I can bypass check for the word \"javascript\" and instead of \"alert\" I have used \"confirm\". Here is the fiddle of the above vector: http://jsfiddle.net/23sqP/\n\nI have used `\\0C` because in the following code in CodeIgniter:\n\n`protected function _js_link_removal($match)\n    {\n                //echo \"in link removal\";\n        return str_replace($match[1],\n                    preg_replace('#href=.*?(?:alert\\(|alert&\\#40;|javascript:|livescript:|mocha:|charset=|window\\.|document\\.|\\.cookie|<script|<xss|data\\s*:)#si',\n                            '',\n                            $this->_filter_attributes(str_replace(array('<', '>'), '', $match[1]))\n                    ),\n                    $match[0]);\n    }`\n\nyou guys are expecting = after \"href\" and in order to defeat this RE, I have used `\\0C` after href and before = symbol. Closely look at the fiddle given above for XSS vector.\n\nRegards,\n\n@soaj1664ashar\n","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bcit-ci/CodeIgniter/issues/comments/25691536/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"soaj1664","id":763359,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc2MzM1OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/763359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/soaj1664","html_url":"https://github.com/soaj1664","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/soaj1664/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/soaj1664/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/soaj1664/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/soaj1664/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/soaj1664/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/soaj1664/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/soaj1664/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/soaj1664/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/soaj1664/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":68676881,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50Njg2NzY4ODE=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bcit-ci/CodeIgniter/issues/events/68676881","actor":{"login":"narfbg","id":1058011,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNTgwMTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1058011?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg","html_url":"https://github.com/narfbg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2013-10-04T11:09:57Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":68676882,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDY4Njc2ODgy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bcit-ci/CodeIgniter/issues/events/68676882","actor":{"login":"narfbg","id":1058011,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNTgwMTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1058011?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg","html_url":"https://github.com/narfbg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2013-10-04T11:09:57Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":68676883,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50Njg2NzY4ODM=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bcit-ci/CodeIgniter/issues/events/68676883","actor":{"login":"ragingdave","id":1168344,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNjgzNDQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1168344?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ragingdave","html_url":"https://github.com/ragingdave","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ragingdave/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ragingdave/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ragingdave/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ragingdave/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ragingdave/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ragingdave/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ragingdave/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ragingdave/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ragingdave/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2013-10-04T11:09:57Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":68676884,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDY4Njc2ODg0","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bcit-ci/CodeIgniter/issues/events/68676
