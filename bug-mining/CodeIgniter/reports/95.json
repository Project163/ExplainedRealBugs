However, var is no longer required. In versions of PHP from 5.0 to 5.1.3, the use of var was considered deprecated and would issue an E_STRICT warning, but since PHP 5.1.3 it is no longer deprecated and does not issue the warning.\n\nIf you declare a property using var instead of one of public, protected, or private, then PHP 5 will treat the property as if it had been declared as public.\"\n\nI think CodeIgniter should use the new declaration as public, private or protected.\n","closed_by":{"login":"philsturgeon","id":67381,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY3Mzgx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/67381?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/philsturgeon","html_url":"https://github.com/philsturgeon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philsturgeon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philsturgeon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philsturgeon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philsturgeon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philsturgeon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philsturgeon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philsturgeon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philsturgeon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philsturgeon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bcit-ci/CodeIgniter/issues/803/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bcit-ci/CodeIgniter/issues/803/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
