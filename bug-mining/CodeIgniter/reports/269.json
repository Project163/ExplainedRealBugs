Maybe other functions are in effect too, I did not checked them.\n\nThis should be considered as bug, as functions select_max, select_min, select_avg, select_sum wont't work if column have same name as sql command.\n\nFor example, if you have column named `left` and you will do:\n\n``` php\n$this->db->select_max('left');\n```\n\nCI will query this as \n\n``` mysql\nSELECT MAX(`left`) AS left \n```\n\nInstead, it should correctly be\n\n``` mysql\nSELECT MAX(`left`) AS `left`\n```\n\nIf user currently needs to achieve correct query, he has to use\n\n``` php\n$this->db->select_max('left','`left`');\n```\n\nThis should be easily fixed.\n","closed_by":{"login":"narfbg","id":1058011,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNTgwMTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1058011?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg","html_url":"https://github.com/narfbg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bcit-ci/CodeIgniter/issues/2585/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bcit-ci/CodeIgniter/issues/2585/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
