That even in 2016 people like you will come here complaining that the framework isn't adding tens of lines of code for something that you can do by simply wrapping `do_upload()` in a foreach loop.\n\nWe're not discussing this; it's rejected and that's why it has the \"Won't Fix\" label. The issue has been kept open just so you don't open new ones about the same thing.\n","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bcit-ci/CodeIgniter/issues/comments/161605961/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"narfbg","id":1058011,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNTgwMTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1058011?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg","html_url":"https://github.com/narfbg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bcit-ci/CodeIgniter/issues/comments/161606731","html_url":"https://github.com/bcit-ci/CodeIgniter/issues/173#issuecomment-161606731","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bcit-ci/CodeIgniter/issues/173","id":161606731,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE2MTYwNjczMQ==","user":{"login":"webeasystep","id":12447746,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNDQ3NzQ2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12447746?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/webeasystep","html_url":"https://github.com/webeasystep","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/webeasystep/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/webeasystep/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/webeasystep/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/webeasystep/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/webeasystep/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/webeasystep/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/webeasystep/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/webeasystep/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/webeasystep/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-12-03T11:39:13Z","updated_at":"2015-12-03T11:39:56Z","body":"people

hate going off-topic on stupid shit, but I also hate it when people talk nonsense and I especially hate it when every refusal to implement a shorthand for something is met with \"blah blah blah DRY blah blah\".\n\nIf you truly understood the DRY concept, you would know that it stands for \"Don't Repeat Yourself\". So please explain to me, how is implementing a `do_multiple_uploads()` method is not in fact repetition of all the `do_upload()` logic? Because that would be, by definition, a violation of the DRY principle.\nAnd furthermore, how would it make _your_ code more in tact with DRY? The way I see it, there's nothing WET about the following piece of code:\n\n```\nforeach (['file1', 'file2', 'file3'] as $field)\n{\n    $this->upload->initialize($config);\n    if ($this->upload->do_upload($field))\n    {\n        // success\n    }\n    else\n    {\n        // error\n    }\n}\n```\n\nAnd last but not least, DRY, KISS and whatever other catchy-name principles you can think of, are not the holy grail of programming and must not be followed blindly. There's always context to have in mind and you must always, always _know_ why you're doing something.\n","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bcit-ci/CodeIgniter/issues/comments/161617403/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"narfbg","id":1058011,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNTgwMTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1058011?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg","html_url":"https://github.com/narfbg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bcit-ci/CodeIgniter/issues/comments/161663186","html_url":"https://github.com/bcit-ci/CodeIgniter/issues/173#issuecomment-161663186","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bcit-ci/CodeIgniter/issues/173","id":161663186,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE2MTY2MzE4Ng==","user":{"login":"narfbg","id":1058011,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNTgwMTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1058011?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg","html_url":"https://github.com/narfbg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-12-03T14:55:46Z","updated_at":"2015-12-03T14:55:46Z","body":"@davidgv88 Your last comment didn't accidentally disappear, I deleted it.
