alternative looks misleading. Either it's extending from bool to a bitwise flag, or there really is a third parameter on it's own which I doubt. XSS is sanitization by current use. So two parameters for the same domain really sounds misleading even if it appears as a \"simple\" solution upfront. Never-mind I'm doing clever-speaking here only, so don't trust my words. This issue brings up XSS in CI for the first time to me, thanks for the insight.\n\nAnd I assume _global XSS_ is just a global variable that can be changed any-time within the current request, so a global variable and not a constant. Which could solve your problem first-hand: If it is a password field, read the option, set it to false, process the password field input, set it to the old value. Not very comfortable but this could be hidden into the form helpers in case of code re-use.\n\nJust some thoughts, take it as feedback.

Be it an array hash or just a single value with bits sets, this in principle expresses the same, it's just that bitwise flags are more direct in terms of memory usage and access. Anyway, this keeps related settings in one parameter.\n\nThe on-the-fly global config file adjustment is far more complex and my talking about it obviously looks short-sighted. Additionally modifying a context that is merely undefined to control the actually processing in that context is really insane. It highly likely will break with upcoming changes. Could have made it under circumstances, but I think `$_POST` is as you write processed pretty in the beginning, so not really worth to deal with. Far better to make the behaviour of \"global XSS\" predictable and especially control-able.

It's been so long since I've had to do pure PHP db manipulations, I guess I'm pretty spoiled by frameworks like CodeIgniter, that I didn't consider this. Please excuse my imprecision.\n\nInstead of making assumptions about what is going on, cause I haven't yet scanned through the Security class to study it, I'll just say that the manipulation that is going on right now with global XSS enabled and $this->input->post('var', FALSE) is conversion of, for example, & to & amp; (without the space between the & and amp). You can perhaps see why my brain jumped to conclusions WRT htmlspecialchars :)\n\nWhat do you guys think is the most elegant fix for this problem and all of the confusion caused by the different kinds of text manipulation and the framework syntax? What I wrote above would what I think would be developer-friendly, but perhaps there are other variables I'm not taking into account?\n","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bcit-ci/CodeIgniter/issues/comments/1943663/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"joeauty","id":370097,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3MDA5Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/370097?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/joeauty","html_url":"https://github.com/joeauty","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joeauty/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joeauty/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joeauty/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joeauty/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joeauty/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joeauty/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joeauty/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joeauty/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joeauty/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bcit-ci/CodeIgniter/issues/comments/1950315","html_url":"https://github.com/bcit-ci/CodeIgniter/issues/346#issuecomment-1950315","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bcit-ci/CodeIgniter/issues/346","id":1950315,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE5NTAzMTU=","user":{"login":"kenjis","id":87955,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg3OTU1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/87955?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kenjis","html_url":"https://github.com/kenjis","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kenjis/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kenjis/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kenjis/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kenjis/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kenjis/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kenjis/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kenjis/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kenjis/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kenjis/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2011-08-30T22:22:36Z","updated_at":"2011-08-30T22:22:36Z","body":"My understanding is follows. \n\nGlobal XSS filtering run at initialization of CI.
