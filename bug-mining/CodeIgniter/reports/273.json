So, for example, if a website on the same domain created a cookie that CI doesn't like, it's going to crash, even though the other website might be completely unrelated.\n\nThis is easy to test with Glype, which creates cookies with names such as \"c[nameofwebsite.com][/][authtoken]\":\n- Put a clean install of Glype (http://www.glype.com/downloads.php) and a clean install of CI on the same domain.\n- Run Glype once then run CI.\n- CI crashes even though it's a clean install.\n\nI think this is a big problem because it means CI can randomly crashes when things outside of its own environment change. For now, the problem can be \"fixed\" by clearing the cookies, but a permanent solution would obviously be better.\n","closed_by":{"login":"narfbg","id":1058011,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNTgwMTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1058011?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg","html_url":"https://github.com/narfbg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bcit-ci/CodeIgniter/issues/33/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bcit-ci/CodeIgniter/issues/33/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
