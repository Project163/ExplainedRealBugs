can load config variables into sections with `$this->config->load('some_config', TRUE)`, and you can get these config variables using `$this->config->item('variable', 'some_config')`, but I can't find a way to set them manually using `$this->config->set_item()`, for example.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bcit-ci/CodeIgniter/issues/1327/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bcit-ci/CodeIgniter/issues/1327/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bcit-ci/CodeIgniter/issues/comments/5784430","html_url":"https://github.com/bcit-ci/CodeIgniter/issues/708#issuecomment-5784430","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bcit-ci/CodeIgniter/issues/708","id":5784430,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU3ODQ0MzA=","user":{"login":"narfbg","id":1058011,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNTgwMTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1058011?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg","html_url":"https://github.com/narfbg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2012-05-18T11:54:05Z","updated_at":"2012-05-18T11:54:05Z","body":"So, this one's an exact duplicate of issue #180.\n\nThe use of a static var is intended to speed up things, but it does indeed make it hard to keep track of dynamic config changes. So, there are two options:\n- Make `config_item()` to be yet another function-to-method alias or in other words - lose the small speed gain coming from the static var use and just point it to `CI_Config::item()`.\n- Make it clear in the documentation that this function should NOT be used with dynamically changed config items and that `CI_Config::item()` should be used in such cases instead.\n\n... I vote for the second one.\n","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bcit-ci/CodeIgniter/issues/comments/5784430/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"narfbg","id":1058011,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNTgwMTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1058011?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg","html_url":"https://github.com/narfbg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":15758860,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDE1NzU4ODYw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bcit-ci/CodeIgniter/issues/events/15758860","actor":{"login":"narfbg","id":1058011,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNTgwMTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1058011?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg","html_url":"https://github.com/narfbg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2012-05-18T11:54:05Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bcit-ci/CodeIgniter/issues/comments/5785323","html_url":"https://github.com/bcit-ci/CodeIgniter/issues/708#issuecomment-5785323","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bcit-ci/CodeIgniter/issues/708","id":5785323,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU3ODUzMjM=","user":{"login":"SlimDeluxe","id":131700,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMTcwMA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/131700?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SlimDeluxe","html_url":"https://github.com/SlimDeluxe","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SlimDeluxe/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SlimDeluxe/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SlimDeluxe/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SlimDeluxe/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SlimDeluxe/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SlimDeluxe/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SlimDeluxe/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SlimDeluxe/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SlimDeluxe/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2012-05-18T12:51:35Z","updated_at":"2012-05-18T12:56:16Z","body":"As an OOP I personally would move the static var into \"public Config::config\", so Config::set_item() would be able to drop/update it.
