'config' : str_replace('.php', '', $file);\n...\n}\n}\n\nFor example:\ni have a config.php file in - PHP\\application\\third_party\\my_app\\config\\config.php\n\nSo i add this package, and try to load the file\n$this->load->add_package_path(APPPATH . 'third_party/my_app');\n$this->config->load('config');\n\nBut in this case, CI will always return TRUE on line 131 in CI_Config and skip to load package/config\nBecause, PHP\\application\\config\\config.php is loaded at the beginning.\n\nI don't know this is a bug or not. I fix it by create a function pass the package config path to load the config file.\n","closed_by":{"login":"narfbg","id":1058011,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNTgwMTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1058011?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg","html_url":"https://github.com/narfbg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bcit-ci/CodeIgniter/issues/3642/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bcit-ci/CodeIgniter/issues/3642/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
