Error: 403 4.5.1 Error: already authenticated\nUnable to send email using PHP SMTP. Your server might not be configured to send mail using this method.\n```\n\nSo my smtp server responds me 403 error, I investigated email library in system folder, it tries to reauth everytime in loop, and that line indicates that if server returned 503 error, no error, continue to send.\n\nhttps://github.com/bcit-ci/CodeIgniter/blob/develop/system/libraries/Email.php#L2126\n\nBut my server responds 403 instead of 503. \n\nSo I replaced, \n\n```\nif (strpos($reply, '503') === 0)    // Already authenticated\n```\n\nwith\n\n```\nif (strpos($reply, '503') === 0 OR strpos($reply, '403') === 0) // Already authenticated\n```\n\nNow, loop works fine. Every mail goes successfully, but i am confused, am i doing right or it is something wrong with my smtp servers ? \n","closed_by":{"login":"isayeter","id":3602109,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2MDIxMDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3602109?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/isayeter","html_url":"https://github.com/isayeter","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/isayeter/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/isayeter/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/isayeter/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/isayeter/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/isayeter/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/isayeter/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/isayeter/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/isayeter/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/isayeter/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bcit-ci/CodeIgniter/issues/4613/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bcit-ci/CodeIgniter/issues/4613/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
