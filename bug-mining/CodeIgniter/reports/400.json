This causes any subsequent transaction (using trans_begin() or trans_start()) to fail as _trans_status is only reset during trans_complete(). \nIt is possible to get a query failure, fix the issue and then attempt a transaction. The way the code works not the transaction will always fail even though all the queries within the transaction were successful.
