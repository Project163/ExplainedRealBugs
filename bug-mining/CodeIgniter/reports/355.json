This means you are not obligated to place all of your configuration files in an environment folder. Only the files that change per environment. Additionally you don’t have to copy all the config items in the environment config file. Only the config items that you wish to change for your environment. The config items declared in your environment folders always overwrite those in your global config files.\"\n\nhttp://www.codeigniter.com/userguide3/libraries/config.html#environments\n\nDoes this mean that if I create a config file /config/application.php and in that file I have \n\n```\n$config['foo'] = 'bar';\n$config['bar'] = 'foo';\n```\n\nThen in a config environment folder /config/development/application.php\n\n```\n$config['bar'] = 'NOT FOO';\n```\n\nAnd I set the environment using \"SetEnv CI_ENV development\" in the .htaccess it sets the ENVIRONMENT in index.php to development. Therefore based on the documentation \"CodeIgniter always loads the global config file first (i.e., the one in application/config/), then tries to load the configuration files for the current environment\"\n\n/config/application.php - first\n/config/development/application.php - second\n\nThen it goes on to say: \"Additionally you don’t have to copy all the config items in the environment config file. Only the config items that you wish to change for your environment. The config items declared in your environment folders always overwrite those in your global config files.\" \n\nTherefore when I load the application config file in the development environment I should have:\n\n```\n$config['foo'] = 'bar';\n$config['bar'] = 'NOT FOO';\n```\n\nUnfortunately that's not what I have. I have:\n\n```\n$config['bar'] = 'NOT FOO';\n```\n\nand that's it. no $config['foo'] value.\n\nI setup the application config file and the application development config file. Then I replace Welcome::index() with:\n\n```\n$this->config->load('application',TRUE);\n\necho '<p>'.$this->config->item('foo', 'application').'</p>';\necho '<p>'.$this->config->item('bar', 'application').'</p>';\n```\n\nwith only /config/application.php I get\n\nbar\nfoo\n\nwith both:\n\n/config/application.php\n/config/development/application.php\n\nI get\n\nNOT FOO\n\nIs this correct based on the wording in the documentation? I asked this before and was told I read it incorrectly in the 2.0 manual (see below). Therefore I wrote my own MY_config.php to actually merge them. When I saw this in the 3.0 documentation I assumed you changed it for 3.0. The only thing which seems to have changed is the wording. \n\nCodeIgniter 2.0 wording:\n\"CodeIgniter always tries to load the configuration files for the current environment first. If the file does not exist, the global config file (i.e., the one in application/config/) is loaded. This means you are not obligated to place all of your configuration files in an environment folder − only the files that change per environment.\"\n\nhttp://www.codeigniter.com/user_guide/libraries/config.html\n\nCodeIgniter 3.0 wording:\n\"CodeIgniter always loads the global config file first (i.e., the one in application/config/), then tries to load the configuration files for the current environment.
