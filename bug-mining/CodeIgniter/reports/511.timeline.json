#5550 doesn't resolve anything.\r\n\r\nAnyway, I assume @Xcreen has no intention of replying or is just unavailable, but he did stumble upon a clue ...\r\n\r\n`validateId()` is *supposed* to be auto-called by PHP 7+ only if the handler implements `SessionUpdateTimestampHandlerInterface`, which it doesn't because that's fucking ridiculous, poorly documented and I'd told the guy who wrote that logic that it's a bad idea, but he listens to nobody but the voices in his head.   \r\nThe security researchers who reported the issue that warranted b3f7aae1079e8e484437bc67f4c126f34e7903d8 were supposed to verify it, and they didn't catch that either.\r\n\r\nYet, `validateId()` *is* somehow being auto-called and triggering those errors. The messages are confusing because that's what tends to happen when the bug is in PHP itself and it somehow doesn't straight-up crash with a segmentation fault.\r\n\r\nSo, a logical solution should be to rename `validateId()` to something else and then drop the version checks so that CI always calls it: \r\n\r\n```diff\r\ndiff --git a/system/libraries/Session/Session_driver.php
