on debian squeeze. When I run `phpunit` in ./tests without any dependencies, I get feedback that many tests are passing but many tests also fail for lack of vfsStreamWrapper.\n\nI did `composer install` on ./, and it installed the vfsStreamWrapper package, but also created another `composer` directory in `vendor/` with some autoload functionality. Now when I run tests, I see\n\n`PHP Fatal error:  Cannot redeclare class Composer\\Autoload\\ClassLoader in \n/home/username/src/username/CodeIgniter/vendor/composer/ClassLoader.php on line 44`\n\nSo I removed line 44 from `./tests/Bootstrap.php` - which looks like it includes the local Autoloader. Now when I run the tests, I again see that many tests pass, but also many errors about vfsStreamWrapper not being found. Here's a sample:\n\n```\nWarning: Class 'org\\bovigo\\vfs\\vfsStreamWrapper' not found in /home/username/src/username/CodeIgniter/tests/Bootstrap.php on line 31\nPHPUnit 3.7.8 by Sebastian Bergmann.\n\nConfiguration read from /home/username/src/username/CodeIgniter/tests/phpunit.xml\n\n........................EEEEEEEEEEEE........................SS.  63 / 238 ( 26%)\nS......................ES.EEEEE................................ 126 / 238 ( 52%)\n.................................................EEEE.......... 189 / 238 ( 79%)\n....................EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE......\n\nTime: 3 seconds, Memory: 8.25Mb\n\nThere were 45 errors:\n\n1) Loader_test::test_library\nInvalidArgumentException: Unable to load vfsStreamWrapper.\n\n2) Loader_test::test_load_library_in_application_dir\nInvalidArgumentException: Unable to load vfsStreamWrapper.\n\n3) Loader_test::test_non_existent_model\nInvalidArgumentException: Unable to load vfsStreamWrapper.\n\n4) Loader_test::test_models\nInvalidArgumentException: Unable to load vfsStreamWrapper.\n\n.\n.\n.\nand so on...\n```\n\nHow do I get this to work?
