I am using the database driver with MySQL.\r\n\r\nI was finally able to figure out reproduction steps. Basically, if the session read fails to obtain the lock (e.g the timeout limit is reached)...\r\n\r\n```\r\nif ($this->_get_lock($session_id) !== FALSE) { ... }\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen `$this->_session_id` is not set, which is needed by write() to detect session_regenerate_id() calls.\r\n\r\nThen, during the write, this runs:\r\n\r\n```\r\n// Was the ID regenerated?\r\nif ($session_id !== $this->_session_id)\r\n{\r\n\tif ( ! $this->_release_lock() OR ! $this->_get_lock($session_id))\r\n\t{\r\n\t\treturn $this->_fail();\r\n\t}\r\n\r\n\t$this->_row_exists = FALSE;\r\n\t$this->_session_id = $session_id;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf the lock is obtained here, then the write doesn't fail, but instead tries to update the session_id (not shown), resulting in the duplicate entry.\r\n\r\nPerhaps, if `$this->_get_lock($session_id) === FALSE` in the read, then it should cause a failure?","closed_by":{"login":"narfbg","id":1058011,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNTgwMTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1058011?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg","html_url":"https://github.com/narfbg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bcit-ci/CodeIgniter/issues/4923/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bcit-ci/CodeIgniter/issues/4923/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
