Additionally, if the bytes returned is less than the bytes trying to be written, fwrite() should be called again.\n\nCode in question:\n\n``` php\n// CodeIgniter 2.1.4 Email.php line 1844\nprotected function _send_data($data)\n{\n    if ( ! fwrite($this->_smtp_connect, $data . $this->newline))\n    {\n        $this->_set_error_message('lang:email_smtp_data_failure', $data);\n        return FALSE;\n    }\n    else\n    {\n        return TRUE;\n    }\n}\n```\n\nSee the example code provided by the PHP website.  It remains in a loop until all bytes have been written, or a false has been returned. \n\n``` php\nfunction fwrite_stream($fp, $string) {\n    for ($written = 0; $written < strlen($string); $written += $fwrite) {\n        $fwrite = fwrite($fp, substr($string, $written));\n        if ($fwrite === false) {\n            return $written;\n        }\n    }\n    return $written;\n}\n```\n","closed_by":{"login":"narfbg","id":1058011,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNTgwMTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1058011?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg","html_url":"https://github.com/narfbg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bcit-ci/CodeIgniter/issues/2822/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bcit-ci/CodeIgniter/issues/2822/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
