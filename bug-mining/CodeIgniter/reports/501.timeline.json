-10-12T22:07:52Z","body":"Doing some experimenting, I've found out a couple of things.\r\n- `select()` does not generally accept an array. You should give it a string. It just so happens to work for simple arrays of field names, but won't work for `array('table.field1', 'table.field2')` etc. So don't rely on that behavior. Makes you wish you were working in a statically typed language. Please forgive my earlier suggestion to do this--I don't actually use the query builder in production so I'm a little unfamiliar with it.\r\n- Queries like this with `tablename.fieldname` will fail unless you supply a `from('tablename')`, `get('tablename')`, or maybe if you have table alias set in the model class (I didn't really look into this).\r\n\r\nThis seems to work OK regardless of whether you set the dbprefix or not:\r\n```php\r\n$this->db->dbprefix('prefix_');\r\n$rows = $this->db->select('table_name.first_name, table_name.last_name')\r\n                 ->get('table_name')\r\n                 ->result_array();\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo anyways, that should be how to do it. You were getting a different query from `get_compiled_select()` because you were supplying the table name in that call.\r\n\r\nI'm pretty sure this is not a bug, but it does seem like some sort of error message would be appropriate if a developer omits `get('table_name')` or `from('table_name')` or we otherwise don't know the table name. For example I get this on sqlite:\r\n```php\r\n$rows = $this->db->select('table_name.first_name')->get()->result_array();\r\n// Gives: SQLite3::query(): Unable to prepare statement: 1, no such column: table_name.first_name\r\n```\r\nwhich is a bit misleading. It does exist, but the table name isn't set on the query.\r\n\r\nSo I guess there is some question of whether we should infer the table name from the `select` if it was of the form `table_name.field_name`, but I think it might be most appropriate to just throw an exception saying you need to supply the table name. I could also see leaving it as is but maybe spelling this out a little in the documentation.","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bcit-ci/CodeIgniter/issues/comments/336286735/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"zploskey","id":542191,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0MjE5MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/542191?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zploskey","html_url":"https://github.com/zploskey","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zploskey/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zploskey/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zploskey/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zploskey/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zploskey/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zploskey/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zploskey/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zploskey/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zploskey/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":1292340955,"node_id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDEyOTIzNDA5NTU=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bcit-ci/CodeIgniter/issues/events/1292340955","actor":{"login":"narfbg","id":1058011,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNTgwMTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1058011?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg","html_url":"https://github.com/narfbg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2017-10-13T14:04:53Z","label":{"name":"Bug","color":"eb2420"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":1292341034,"node_id":"MDE1Ok1pbGVzdG9uZWRFdmVudDEyOTIzNDEwMzQ=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bcit-ci/CodeIgniter/issues/events/1292341034","actor":{"login":"narfbg","id":1058011,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNTgwMTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1058011?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg","html_url":"https://github.com/narfbg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"milestoned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2017-10-13T14:04:56Z","milestone":{"title":"3.1.7"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":1292341181,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDEyOTIzNDExODE=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bcit-ci/CodeIgniter/issues/events/1292341181","actor":{"login":"narfbg","id":1058011,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNTgwMTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1058011?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg","html_url":"https://github.com/narfbg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"fa2a0c58eb0f6421e3819df8a8873b5a5e4ebb58","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bcit-ci/CodeIgniter/commits/fa2a0c58eb0f6421e3819df8a8873b5a5e4ebb58","created_at":"2017-10-13T14:05:01Z","performed_via_

Thanks for your help on this.\r\n\r\nHowever, the following (that you said) is patently false:\r\n\r\n> `select()` does not generally accept an array. You should give it a string. It just so happens to work for simple arrays of field names, but won't work for `array('table.field1', 'table.field2')` etc.\r\n\r\nThe very first thing that `select()` does is `explode(',', $string_input)` if the input is a string. Everything is stored as an array internally, and as strings are inherently unreliable, we shouldn't encourage their use.\r\nArrays are more than fine. It's just that there are way too many lazy developers that would riot if we disabled the string option.\r\n\r\nThe issue here had nothing to do with this either.
