It came to our attention that the tester was able do blind os injection, executing arbitrary commands from the server through the ci mail library.\n\nHe was able to do this because, first, user data was not sanitized and second, CI E-mail library uses 'popen' to send mails through 'sendmail'.\n\nThe first problem is something a developer should always do, sanitize user data before sending it to the server. But I can see that this might be a very common security breach in many ci applications using sendmail. I'm wondering if there isn't a factored in solution for arbitrary commands sent when using the sendmail option. Or maybe at least there should be a bigger warning when a developer uses sendmail for sending mail because of the nature in which it is set up in CI (through fopen).\n","closed_by":{"login":"narfbg","id":1058011,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNTgwMTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1058011?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg","html_url":"https://github.com/narfbg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bcit-ci/CodeIgniter/issues/4844/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bcit-ci/CodeIgniter/issues/4844/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
