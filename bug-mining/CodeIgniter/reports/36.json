To the best of my knowledge, this is what’s happening:\n\nIn the ‘system/helpers/date_helper.php’ file on line 47 (as well as system/libraries/Session.php line 623), the timestamp is being formed by several gmdate() functions combined within a mktime() function. The problem with this: gmdate() outputs a GMT/UTC-based date/time, and mktime() does as well. Therefore, we’re doubling our efforts here and converting to UTC twice. That would certainly explain why now() output a timestamp 5 hours ahead of the actual UTC time (for me since I’m in America/Chicago).\n\nInstead of using mktime(), CodeIgniter should be using gmmktime() since it expects to receive GMT/UTC values. When I changed line 47 to reflect this, the problems noted in my previous post vanished. Now, that said…\n\nI STILL DO NOT UNDERSTAND THE POINT OF THE now() FUNCTION. Was there a time or are there certain installations of PHP where time() will return a Unix timestamp referencing the timezone set for PHP? That’s the only reason I can think of that would explain why this function exists. I'm flummoxed. Someone please set me straight here.\n","closed_by":{"login":"narfbg","id":1058011,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNTgwMTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1058011?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg","html_url":"https://github.com/narfbg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bcit-ci/CodeIgniter/issues/27/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bcit-ci/CodeIgniter/issues/27/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
