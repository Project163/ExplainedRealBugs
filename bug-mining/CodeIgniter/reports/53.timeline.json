Right now it all works perfectly fine. If somebody hardcodes a specific base_url I absolutely expect it to only ever use links with that specific base_url, meaning if I set my base to https and I load it on http, then I would expect all links to be https.\n\nSo, if right now CodeIgniter behaves as expected, and the change offers nothing useful other than changing the syntax of what we do already then what is the point? Is the one if statement required to check so  expensive we need to remove it and recode a bunch of logic around it, leading to more potential bugs for no benefit?\n\nIf somebody wants to set the base_url to `//foo.com/` then that may or may not work, there will be some regular expressions that might need updating, but thats not something that CI should do by default. Other than that we have no feature request here and no bug.\n","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bcit-ci/CodeIgniter/issues/comments/6491499/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"philsturgeon","id":67381,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY3Mzgx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/67381?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/philsturgeon","html_url":"https://github.com/philsturgeon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philsturgeon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philsturgeon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philsturgeon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philsturgeon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philsturgeon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philsturgeon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philsturgeon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philsturgeon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philsturgeon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}}]
