The line is:\n\n```\nRewriteCond $1 !^(index\\.php|images|robots\\.txt)\n```\n\nHowever, if you have a controller that starts with \"images\" (or any other folder you happen to add to the line), opening the appropriate URL bypasses CI and the server returns a 404 Not Found error. I had this when I added my \"js\" (Javascript) folder to the list, but then created a Json controller.\n\nThe current one blocks many common files such as favicon.ico, sitemaps, webmaster tools verification files and more. It even blocks the CI user guide! Here's a simplified version of what I'm using that solved the problem:\n\n```\nRewriteCond $1 !^(([^/]+\\.[^/]+)|images/|user_guide/)\n```\n\nThe first part checks for any file with a dot in it, then for folders, specifically ending with `/`. Hope this helps :)\n","closed_by":{"login":"ericlbarnes","id":116662,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNjY2Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/116662?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericlbarnes","html_url":"https://github.com/ericlbarnes","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericlbarnes/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericlbarnes/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericlbarnes/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericlbarnes/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericlbarnes/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericlbarnes/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericlbarnes/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericlbarnes/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericlbarnes/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bcit-ci/CodeIgniter/issues/684/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bcit-ci/CodeIgniter/issues/684/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
