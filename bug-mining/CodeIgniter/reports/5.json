Check the following post for details about what I am trying to do: http://codeigniter.com/forums/viewthread/178442/\n\nThe set_value() was buggy as well but recently got fixed: https://bitbucket.org/ellislab/codeigniter-reactor/changeset/19fc3732e593\n\nThe current set_select() function checks, when it's an array, if the selected value is in the POST array for the current field name. When you select different options from the select boxes there will be a few different values in the POST array. This will result in select boxes where multiple options will have the 'selected=\"selected\"' added to it. I hope you understand what I mean. \n\nFor example: I have 3 select boxes with example[] as name and 'example-1', 'example-2' and 'example-3' as options. Select 'example-1' for the first, 'example-2' for the second and  'example-3' for the third select box, hit the submit button and make sure the form validation fails. Now set_select() should do the re-population for the 3 example[] select boxes. But all options from all the select boxes will get the 'selected=\"selected\"' added to it :(\n","closed_by":{"login":"narfbg","id":1058011,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNTgwMTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1058011?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg","html_url":"https://github.com/narfbg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bcit-ci/CodeIgniter/issues/35/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bcit-ci/CodeIgniter/issues/35/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
