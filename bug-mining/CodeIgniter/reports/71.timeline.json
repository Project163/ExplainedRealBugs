means that all files and folders are 'open to the public' anyway, which means that with our convenient solution, you are no worse off from where you started.\n\nAltering the rewrite rules to suit your

of the first questions I found on SO searching for 'codeigniter' and 'mod_rewrite' was this: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6756181/mod-rewrite-for-codeigniter\nI think questions and answers like

You would hope that developers are smart enough to figure out when their controller names are conflicting with directories of the same name.\n\nThe error doesn't come when controllers have the _same_ name as folders on your system - it happens when _part_ of the controller name matches a folder. For example an `images` folder with a controller `ImageShow`, or my my `js` & `JSON` example above. I'm a seasoned developer (10+ years in PHP, over a year in CodeIgniter) and it still took me a good while to figure out it was an htaccess problem.\n\nRepox's solution looks like the best one. It doesn't leave files \"visible to the public\" since there is already a separate `.htaccess` under the application and system folders that protects those.\n","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bcit-ci/CodeIgniter/issues/comments/2856457/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"svivian","id":207887,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwNzg4Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/207887?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/svivian","html_url":"https://github.com/svivian","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/svivian/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/svivian/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/svivian/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/svivian/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/svivian/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/svivian/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/svivian/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/svivian/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/svivian/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bcit-ci/CodeIgniter/issues/comments/3057984","html_url":"https://github.com/bcit-ci/CodeIgniter/issues/684#issuecomment-3057984","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bcit-ci/CodeIgniter/issues/684","id":3057984,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMwNTc5ODQ=","user":{"login":"ericlbarnes","id":116662,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNjY2Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/116662?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericlbarnes","html_url":"https://github.com/ericlbarnes","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericlbarnes/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericlbarnes/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericlbarnes/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericlbarnes/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericlbarnes/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericlbarnes/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericlbarnes/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericlbarnes/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericlbarnes/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2011-12-08T04:59:37Z","updated_at":"2011-12-08T04:59:37Z","body":"Since
