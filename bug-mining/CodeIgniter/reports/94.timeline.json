include:\n- `oci_execute()` related:\n  - Moved the call from `num_rows()` to `_data_seek()`, as it's purpose is to reset the internal pointer to zero. It's now only called by `CI_DB_oci8_driver::_execute()` (as it should). `_data_seek()` is left there for consistency and isn't called anywhere. This was the main reason for every performance problem with this driver.\n  - If we're using PHP version >= 5.3.2 - we'll now utilize the new `OCI_NO_AUTO_COMMIT` mode flag instead of `OCI_DEFAULT`, which is left as an alias.\n  - Now only pass the mode flag if we are in the middle of a transaction (see the notes about `OCI_NO_AUTO_COMMIT` in [php.net](http://www.php.net/manual/en/function.oci-execute.php) for details). `OCI_COMMIT_ON_SUCCESS` is the default, so it doesn't need to be explicitly set.\n- `num_rows()` related:\n  - Now must be called explicitly (used to be automatically called by `CI_DB_driver`) to avoid `result_array` be set every time while it might not be needed (another possible performance glitch).\n  - The `num_rows` property is now set to `NULL` by default, so we can have a way to know if 0 is the actual count or we have to get it. Also put multiple hooks for this to be set by other methods. Of course - this still doesn't allow `num_rows()` to be used to check before actual data is fetched (as in other database drivers), because we still need to actually do a `count()` on the result set. I hope that Oracle will some day release a solution for this.\n  - Added an oracle-specific note to the `num_rows()` documentation.\n- `free_result()` now really frees `stmt_id` and/or `curs_id`, if they are valid resources. Until now it did a check if `result_id` is a resource and try to clear it, but that's actually a boolean value.\n- Added `custom_result_object()` and all of the row-fetching methods instead of using the parents from `CI_DB_result`. The new ones only fetch rows when needed, follow `current_row` on their own (we don't want to use `_data_seek()`) and cast from/to arrays/objects when needed. This should also significantly improve performance for those who like to deal with single rows at a time.\n- Added `DROP TABLE` support in `CI_DB_oci8_forge`.\n- Added `_list_databases()` support in `CI_DB_oci8_utility`.\n- Fixed some typos and cleaned up some comments, spaces, unneeded expressions, etc.\n\nI know it's a rather large patch to review/merge, but in order to avoid calling `oci_execute()` multiple times - pretty much all of it should be done at once, so there's no way around it. Plus it should solve every oci8-related issue so far reported.\n\nI've tested most of the stuff (actually, all but DB forge and DB utility) - it works, so ... I hope it doesn't take too much time to review. Any suggestions are welcome. :)\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bcit-ci/CodeIgniter/issues/868/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bcit-ci/CodeIgniter/issues/868/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":10547329,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDEwNTQ3MzI5","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bcit-ci/CodeIgniter/issues/events/10547329","actor":{"login":"narfbg","id":1058011,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNTgwMTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1058011?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg","html_url":"https://github.com/narfbg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"601f8b209d93fe70786776d9170eed5e23201e58","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bcit-ci/CodeIgniter/commits/601f8b209d93fe70786776d9170eed5e23201e58","created_at":"2012-03-01T18:11:36Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":10547375,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MTA1NDczNzU=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bcit-ci/CodeIgniter/issues/events/10547375","actor":{"login":"narfbg","id":1058011,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNTgwMTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1058011?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg","html_url":"https://github.com/narfbg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2012-03-01T18:12:02Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
