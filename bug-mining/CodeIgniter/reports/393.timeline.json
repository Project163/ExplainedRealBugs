is not a waste of time at all!  It stops from having to concatenate your query and the code is less verbose. I also do not have to check if I have already included my \"AND\" or start off my where clause with a 1=1 to get around that.  It just feels much cleaner.  I don't have to worry about escaping my values because it is already being done.  The whole point of it is to assist with dynamic queries, but right now you are saying that if your dynamic query contains a subselect you are out of luck and go use raw sql.  Raw queries are fine if you have a fixed amount of criteria and selected columns.\n\nWhat is the point of trying to escape everything?  People should be trying to stay away from reserved words in their tables and column names anyway.

your initial SQL with query builder, then use something like `get_compiled_select()` to get the raw SQL to use in a sub-query, it is almost impossible to pass it back into query builder without breaking something, especially if you pass the sub-query into `from()`, which has no option for disabling escaping the query. Obviously, double-escaping is part of the problem if I do things this way, but my point is simply that sub-queries don't have to start as raw SQL.\n\nI'd really be happy if I could just call a method to disable escaping until `_reset_select()`/`_reset_write()` is called. I generally only have a problem with it for 1-2% of the queries I might run, and most of those are on pages which require a larger number of queries than usual, so the choice of disabling it through the back door through unsupported configuration or optionally on some methods (but not having the option to disable it on other methods) just doesn't work.\n\nI ended up hacking together a version of query builder's `where()` functionality in my model to return the text for my where clause, to make it easier to build a SQL string to pass to `query()`, when I only had to build the string and use `query()` because I couldn't stop the `from()` method from breaking my sub-query.\n","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bcit-ci/CodeIgniter/issues/comments/126007350/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"mwhitneysdsu","id":1537529,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1Mzc1Mjk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1537529?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mwhitneysdsu","html_url":"https://github.com/mwhitneysdsu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mwhitneysdsu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mwhitneysdsu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mwhitneysdsu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mwhitneysdsu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mwhitneysdsu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mwhitneysdsu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mwhitneysdsu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mwhitneysdsu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mwhitneysdsu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":368523517,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MzY4NTIzNTE3","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bcit-ci/CodeIgniter/issues/events/368523517","actor":{"login":"narfbg","id":1058011,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNTgwMTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1058011?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg","html_url":"https://github.com/narfbg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2015-07-29T16:25:05Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":368523518,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDM2ODUyMzUxOA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bcit-ci/CodeIgniter/issues/events/368523518","actor":{"login":"narfbg","id":1058011,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNTgwMTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1058011?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg","html_url":"https://github.com/narfbg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2015-07-29T16:25:05Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
