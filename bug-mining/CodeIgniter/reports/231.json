Following the thread comment, I didn't see any resolution to the problem at all.\n\nthis code should create a key called blog_name_blog_label\n\n``` php\n$this->dbforge->add_key(array('blog_name', 'blog_label'));\n```\n\nunfortunately, it just throws a warning\n\n```\nSeverity: Warning\n\nMessage: Illegal offset type in isset or empty\n\nFilename: mysqli/mysqli_forge.php\n\nLine Number: 184\n```\n\nLooking through the code, I noticed that the mysqli_forge.php file on line 184 doesn't handle keys that are arrays, thus the problem shown above.\n\n``` php\n// these keys can be arrays\nif ( ! isset($this->fields[$this->keys[$i]]))\n{\n  unset($this->keys[$i]);\n  continue;\n}\n```\n\nthe fix is simple enough\n\n``` php\nif(is_array($this->keys[$i]))\n{\n  foreach($this->keys[$i] as $key)\n  {\n    if( ! isset($this->fields[$key]))\n    {\n      unset($this->keys[$i]);\n      break;\n    }\n  }\n}\nelse\n{\n  if ( ! isset($this->fields[$this->keys[$i]]))\n  {\n    unset($this->keys[$i]);\n    continue;\n  }\n}\n```\n\nHowever I'm not sure about just 'unsetting' the values. Would it make more sense to throw an error here instead?\n","closed_by":{"login":"narfbg","id":1058011,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNTgwMTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1058011?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg","html_url":"https://github.com/narfbg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bcit-ci/CodeIgniter/issues/2027/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bcit-ci/CodeIgniter/issues/2027/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
