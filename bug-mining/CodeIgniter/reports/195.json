The Table Data functions aren't able to find my tables. Ex:\nMy schema is named foo and I have a table named bar. The following code will show false.\n\n``` php\n$this->load->database();\nvar_dump($this->db->table_exists('bar'));\n```\n\nI've attached a patch that solves this issue by allowing me to indicate at the database configuration which schemas I want to use. Maybe it's not the correct approach to the project but I like CodeIgniter and wanted to help somehow.
