Mm?\n$validation_array = empty($this->validation_data) ? $_POST : $this->validation_data;\nif (count($validation_array) === 0)\n{\n    return FALSE;\n}\n```\n\nthose lines prevent the validation of empty arrays.  But what happen if the array to validate ends empty somehow?, I'm working on a project with a javascript client that ignores untouched/empty fields, and because of that sometimes i get an empty post. The run() method normally returns FALSE but when calling error_array() method, it obviously shows no error, but i think it should at least tell me that my required fields are in fact required.\n\nRight now this is what I'm doing as workaround:\n\n``` php\nif(count($post) === 0) {\n    $post['___not_empty___'] = TRUE;\n}\n$this->form_validation->set_data($post);\n```\n\nWhat do you think? Hope something can be done.\n\nThanks for the great work.\n","closed_by":{"login":"narfbg","id":1058011,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNTgwMTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1058011?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg","html_url":"https://github.com/narfbg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bcit-ci/CodeIgniter/issues/4312/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bcit-ci/CodeIgniter/issues/4312/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
