file_ext_tolower is documented as \"If set to TRUE, the file extension will be forced to lower case\"\nFor the upload data, the fields are documented as\nfile_name   Name of the file that was uploaded, including the filename extension\nfile_ext    Filename extension, period included\nMy expectation of this was that\n1. file_name always contains file_ext at its end, since it says it includes \"the filename extension\"\n2. therefore, by setting file_ext_tolower I can achieve that the file is stored with a lowercased extension.\n\nIt turns out that only the data element file_ext is lowercased, and no longer corresponds to the end of file_name, while file_name and the actual file stored retain the original (e.g. uppercase) extension.\nI feel that the documentation is misleading (it implies that file_ext is a part of file_name, and therefore would also be lowercased by using this option) and also this behaviour is unhelpful, if I need the file with a lowercased extension, I cannot simply rename it afterwards without running into a risk of name conflict, which the Upload class was intended to protect me from by creating a unique name, but it does this with the uppercased extension. \nExample: person A uploads A1234.jpg, then person B uploads A1234.JPG, Upload class sees no need to adjust, but if I then rename A1234.JPG to A1234.jpg, I would overwrite the previous file, and thus I would have to add filename uniquify code in my application when Upload class was supposed to do this task for me.\n\nIf you want to retain the current behaviour, I suggest that you clarify the documentation for file_ext_tolower: \"only the file_ext data element will be affected by this setting, not the file name used to store the uploaded file in. file_ext will no longer be identical to the extension included in file_name if you set this option.\"\nMany thanks in advance for your consideration.\n","closed_by":{"login":"ke352802081770314","id":10772063,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNzcyMDYz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10772063?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ke352802081770314","html_url":"https://github.com/ke352802081770314","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ke352802081770314/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ke352802081770314/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ke352802081770314/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ke352802081770314/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ke352802081770314/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ke352802081770314/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ke352802081770314/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ke352802081770314/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ke352802081770314/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bcit-ci/CodeIgniter/issues/4430/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bcit-ci/CodeIgniter/issues/4430/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
