This indicates that a human readable (referenced in a language file) name may be given for field names.\n\nWhen you use this functionality and the rule you are testing with fails, the `_translate_fieldname()` function checks for the use of a custom language line.  It does 2 checks, 1 with **form_validation_** prefixed to the line and 1 where it is not (deprecated part).  If the line from the language file was returned then that value will be used as the field name.  If the **form_validation_** prefix was not found in the language line then this is added to the error log.\n\nIt seems like a bug to me because I am supplying the language line to use from my own language file for the **field name**, not the error message.  As such does the prefix **form_validation_** need to be added?  This would indicate that anybody trying to use their own language files for **field names** would need to prefix them with **form_validation_** and to me this seems a little odd.\n\nExample:\nLanguage file test_lang.php\n\n``` php\n$lang['head_field_a'] = 'Your full name';\n```\n\nController with some form validation:\n\n``` php\n$this->lang->load('test');\n$this->load->library('form_validation');\n\n// Field a is some post data that is required\n$this->form_validation->set_rules('field_a', 'lang:head_field_a', 'trim|required');\n\nif ($this->form_validation->run() === TRUE)\n{\n    // Process the form data etc..\n}\n```\n\nIn the above example I am using my own language file for a field name so the end user has a better understanding of what filed the error is in relation to.  If the post data received did not have any data for the **field_a** field then the required validation rule would fail.  As a custom language line was used for the field name, the `_translate_fieldname()` function would prefix my custom language line with **form_validation_** and try to find that (form_validation_head_field_a).  This would produce an error being logged as this line was not found.  My custom line would still be used as it's picked up by the deprecated part of the check (the one without the prefix added).\n\nI'm saying that the **form_validation_** prefix in the `_translate_fieldname()` function does not make any sense.  I understand the need for the prefix to be added for error messages so they do not conflict with our own language files etc.  However the field name is not the error message and as such does not need the prefix added.  I might be using this same language line throughout my project and the prefix of **form_validation_** just doesn't make sense if I want to use this language line in one or more of my views.\n","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bcit-ci/CodeIgniter/issues/comments/92837574/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"kram-dyoll","id":3457509,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0NTc1MDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3457509?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kram-dyoll","html_url":"https://github.com/kram-dyoll","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kram-dyoll/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kram-dyoll/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kram-dyoll/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kram-dyoll/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kram-dyoll/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kram-dyoll/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kram-dyoll/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kram-dyoll/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kram-dyoll/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bcit-ci/CodeIgniter/issues/comments/92860312","html_url":"https://github.com/bcit-ci/CodeIgniter/issues/3771#issuecomment-92860312","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bcit-ci/CodeIgniter/issues/3771","id":92860312,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDkyODYwMzEy","user":{"login":"narfbg","id":1058011,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNTgwMTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1058011?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg","html_url":"https://github.com/narfbg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-04-14T13:56:27Z","updated_at":"2015-04-14T13:56:27Z","body":"Agreed,
