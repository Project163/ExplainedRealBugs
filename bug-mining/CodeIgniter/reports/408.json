check will fail if $id anything other than an actual id (false in my case, because of an expired session that should hold the cache key).\n\nWithout the $id, the check will be on the actual cache directory, which is perfectly valid for file_exists.\n\nReplacing the function with is_file is probably what is intended here.\n\nClient side coding will also solve the problem, but I think in this case, it makes no sense to check for both directory and file.\n\nOn a side note, this bug goes back several version of CI.
