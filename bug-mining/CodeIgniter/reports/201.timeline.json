Then in some cases we will be able to decide how to apply escaping manually. Here is a code drafting:\n\n``` php\n\nif ( ! function_exists('form_value'))\n{\n    /**\n     * Form Value (Raw)\n     *\n     * Grabs a value from the POST array for the specified field so you can\n     * re-populate fields in some special or cutting-edge cases. If Form Validation\n     * is active it retrieves the info from the validation class.\n     *\n     * Important: The result is not HTML-escaped or HTML-attribute-escaped,\n     * you should do it additionalyy according to the context of usage.\n     *\n     * @param   string  $field      Field name\n     * @param   string  $default    Default value\n     * @return  string\n     */\n    function form_value($field, $default = '')\n    {\n        $CI =& get_instance();\n\n        $value = (isset($CI->form_validation) && is_object($CI->form_validation) && $CI->form_validation->has_rule($field))\n            ? $CI->form_validation->set_value($field, $default)\n            : $CI->input->post($field, FALSE);\n\n        return $value === NULL ? $default : $value;\n    }\n}\n```\n","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bcit-ci/CodeIgniter/issues/comments/70848044/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"ivantcholakov","id":1438104,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MzgxMDQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1438104?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivantcholakov","html_url":"https://github.com/ivantcholakov","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivantcholakov/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivantcholakov/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivantcholakov/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivantcholakov/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivantcholakov/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivantcholakov/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivantcholakov/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivantcholakov/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ivantcholakov/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bcit-ci/CodeIgniter/issues/comments/70849735","html_url":"https://github.com/bcit-ci/CodeIgniter/issues/1953#issuecomment-70849735","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bcit-ci/CodeIgniter/issues/1953","id":70849735,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDcwODQ5NzM1","user":{"login":"it-can","id":644288,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0NDI4OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/644288?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/it-can","html_url":"https://github.com/it-can","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/it-can/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/it-can/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/it-can/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/it-can/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/it-can/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/it-can/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/it-can/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/it-can/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/it-can/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-01-21T14:49:27Z","updated_at":"2015-01-21T14:49:27Z","body":"I implemented something similiar in my projects...\n","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bcit-ci/CodeIgniter/issues/comments/70849735/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"it-can","id":644288,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0NDI4OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/644288?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/it-can","html_url":"https://github.com/it-can","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/it-can/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/it-can/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/it-can/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/it-can/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/it-can/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/it-can/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/it-can/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/it-can/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/it-can/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}}]
