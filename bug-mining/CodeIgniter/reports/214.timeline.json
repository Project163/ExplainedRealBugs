using array field names, the source field name is properly parsed into array indexes however the target field name whose value it must match is not parsed into array indexes and subsequently passed to `_reduce_array`.\n\nExample:\n\nGiven two fields, `user[password]` and `user[password_confirmation]`, the following rule will not work as expected\n\n``` php\n<?php\n$this->form_validation->set_rules('user[password_confirmation]', 'Password confirmation', 'matches[user[password]]');\n```\n\nThe value from `user[password_confirmation]` is successfully retrieved from the `$_POST` array, however it looks for the literal `$_POST['user[password]']` field value rather than `$_POST['user']['password']`. Since it doesn't exist, validation fails.\n\nThis is happening in v2.1.2, however it appears develop has the same issue.\n\nI overrode the `matches` function locally to workaround this issue, however it currently duplicates logic found in `set_rules` which should probably be extracted into a single place.\n\n``` php\n<?php\npublic function matches($str, $field)\n{\n  $validation_array = empty($this->validation_data) ? $_POST : $this->validation_data;\n\n  if (strpos($field, '[') !== FALSE AND preg_match_all('/\\[(.*?)\\]/', $field, $matches))\n  {\n    // Note: Due to a bug in current() that affects some versions\n    // of PHP we can not pass function call directly into it\n    $x = explode('[', $field);\n    $indexes[] = current($x);\n\n    for ($i = 0; $i < count($matches['0']); $i++)\n    {\n      if ($matches['1'][$i] != '')\n      {\n        $indexes[] = $matches['1'][$i];\n      }\n    }\n\n    $other_str = $this->_reduce_array($validation_array, $indexes);\n  } else {\n    $other_str = $validation_array[$field];\n  }\n\n  return $str === $other_str;\n}\n```\n\nEDIT: Accidentally submitted the issue before finishing the
