There's a check in `Loader::_ci_load_library()` that checks if the library exists in `BASEPATH/libraries` and, if so, runs `_ci_load_stock_library()`. This method never checks across package folders for classes overriding these core libraries. \n\n@narfbg Is this intentional? Did I just miss it in the docs? Seems like packages should have the ability to override this, yes? \n\nThis came up as a comment on my Profiler bar replacement and I found it when digging through why it wasn't working. Because the profiler bar, being a small package, was placed in the third_party folder and wasn't loading like it used to.\n","closed_by":{"login":"narfbg","id":1058011,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNTgwMTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1058011?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg","html_url":"https://github.com/narfbg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bcit-ci/CodeIgniter/issues/3694/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bcit-ci/CodeIgniter/issues/3694/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
