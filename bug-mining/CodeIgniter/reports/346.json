Just from looking at the code, you could go with:\n- call `_error_handler()` directly (easy fix, but maintains the long-term issue that caused this in the first place), or\n- throw an exception (or, worse yet, pass an Exception to `_exception_handler()`)\n\nI would suggest something along the lines of:\n\n```\n    public function __call($method, $args = array())\n    {\n        if (in_array($method, $this->_methods))\n        {\n            return call_user_func_array(array($this->_parent, $method), $args);\n        }\n        throw new BadMethodCallException(\"No such method '{$method}'\");\n    }\n```\n","closed_by":{"login":"narfbg","id":1058011,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNTgwMTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1058011?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg","html_url":"https://github.com/narfbg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bcit-ci/CodeIgniter/issues/3310/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bcit-ci/CodeIgniter/issues/3310/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
