There are cases where I need my relative URLs to keep their slashes on the right, e.g.\n\n```\n/segment/case/read/\n```\n\nIf you pass the above string into `site_url`, it will remove the `/` on the right side, like so:\n\n```\nsite_url('/segment/case/read/'); // http://www.url.com/segment/case/read\n```\n\nThe desired output should be:\n\n```\nhttp://www.url.com/segment/case/read/\n```\n\nI utilize the `redirect` function for redirects, but if you pass a relative URL it will use `site_url` to prepend your configured URL which affects the relative URL passed.  I have apache configured to force trailing slashes in every request.  If I'm using `redirect` to redirect to a relative URL, apache will force a rewrite and produce a 2nd redirect (303/307 from CI then 301 from apache) which is not the desired output.\n\n`site_url` should only trim the left trailing slash.\n","closed_by":{"login":"narfbg","id":1058011,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNTgwMTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1058011?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg","html_url":"https://github.com/narfbg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bcit-ci/CodeIgniter/issues/4605/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bcit-ci/CodeIgniter/issues/4605/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
