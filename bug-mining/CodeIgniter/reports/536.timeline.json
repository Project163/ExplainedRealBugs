But there is an easy solution using CI extending capability:\n\n(1) create a \"MY_file_helper.php\" in 'application/helpers' (\"MY\" depending on your configuration)\n(2) open the original \"file_helper.php\" in 'system/helpers' and copy the whole get_dir_file_info() function\n(3) paste it into your \"MY_file_helper.php\" (without the if (function_exists()) stuff)\n(4) now we can peacefully modify the behaviour. Replace those two lines : \n\n``` php\n$_filedata[$file] = get_file_info($source_dir.$file);\n$_filedata[$file]['relative_path'] = $relative_path;\n```\n\nby :\n\n``` php\n$result = get_file_info($source_dir.$file);\n$result['relative_path'] = $relative_path;\n$_filedata[] = $result ;\n```\n\n(5) enjoy!\n\nThis is pretty straightforward actually. Instead of using $file as a key, I use a temporary variable ($result) to store the data and then I add it to the file array. A unique key is automatically given by using []. The result now looks like :\n\n``` php\nArray\n(\n0 => Array\n(\n[name] => test.php\n[server_path] => ...application\\language\\french\\test.php\n[size] => 2\n[date] => 1348057318\n[relative_path] => ...application\\language\\french\\\n)\n1 => Array\n(\n[name] => test.php\n[server_path] => ...application\\language\\english\\test.php\n[size] => 2\n[date] => 1348057318\n[relative_path] => ...application\\language\\english\\\n)\n)\n```\n\nHope this helps

think that `get_dir_file_info` is still useful when you know the limitations from the start, and would certainly be faster, in situations where it is appropriate, than what I am about to propose. For that reason, I think it would be best to document the limitation of `get_dir_file_info` and create another solution for the problem (which should also be noted in the documentation of `get_dir_file_info`).\n\nMy proposal would be to add a parameter to `directory_map` in the `directory_helper` which would indicate that the map should include the output of `get_file_info` for each file. So, if this optional parameter were set, the output of `directory_map` would look something like this:\n\n```\nArray \n(\n    [assets] => Array\n    (\n        [bingopizza_dbn] => Array\n        (\n            [language] => Array\n            (\n                [english] => Array\n                (\n                    [sitetext_lang.php] => Array\n                    (\n                        [name] => sitetext_lang.php\n                        [server_path] => ...assets\\bingopizza_dbn\\language\\english\\sitetext_lang.php\n                        [size] => 31\n                        [date] => 1285930111\n                        [relative_path] => ...assets\\bingopizza_dbn\\language\\english\\\n                    )\n                )\n                [spanish] => Array\n                (\n                    [sitetext_lang.php] => Array\n                    (\n                        [name] => sitetext_lang.php\n                        [server_path] => ...assets\\bingopizza_dbn\\language\\spanish\\sitetext_lang.php\n                        [size] => 31\n                        [date] => 1285930111\n                        [relative_path] => ...assets\\bingopizza_dbn\\language\\spanish\\\n                    )\n                )\n            )\n        )\n    )\n)\n```\n\nThis would also be relatively easy to implement, changing line 91 of `directory_helper` from\n\n``` php\n$filedata[] = $file;\n```\n\nto \n\n``` php\n$filedata[] = $new_optional_param ? get_file_info($file) : $file;\n```\n\nand adding something like \n\n``` php\nif ($new_optional_param === true)\n{\n    get_instance()->load->helper('file');\n}\n```\n\nto the beginning of the function.\n\nOf course, much of the output becomes less necessary with the extra info supplied by the structure of the `directory_map` output, so there are many other potential considerations, like accepting yet another optional parameter (or making the new parameter a mixed `false/array()`) to pass as the second parameter for `get_file_info` to tell it what information to return.\n","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bcit-ci/CodeIgniter/issues/comments/63837945/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"mwhitneysdsu","id":1537529,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1Mzc1Mjk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1537529?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mwhitneysdsu","html_url":"https://github.com/mwhitneysdsu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mwhitneysdsu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mwhitneysdsu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mwhitneysdsu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mwhitneysdsu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mwhitneysdsu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mwhitneysdsu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mwhitneysdsu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mwhitneysdsu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mwhitneysdsu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"actor":{"login":"mwhitneysdsu","id":1537529,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1Mzc1Mjk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1537529?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mwhitneysdsu","html_url":"https://github.com/mwhitneysdsu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mwhitneysdsu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mwhitneysdsu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mwhitneysdsu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mwhitneysdsu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mwhitneysdsu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mwhitneysdsu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mwhitneysdsu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mwhitneysdsu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mwhitneysdsu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-11-20T22:43:27Z","updated_at":"2014-11-20T22:43:27Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bcit-ci/CodeIgniter/issues/3347","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bcit-ci/CodeIgniter","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bcit-ci/CodeIgniter/issues/3347/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bcit-ci/CodeIgniter/issues/3347/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bcit-ci/CodeIgniter/issues/3347/events","html_url":"https://github.com/bcit-ci/CodeIgniter/pull/3347","id":49628536,"node_id":"MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0MjQ4MDQ1MTk=","number":3347,"title":"#92

found a weird bug when renaming some of our controllers..\n\nI can load Foo/bar absolutely fine with no issues with code looking like this:\n\n```\nclass Foo extends BF_Controller {\n\n    public function bar() {\n        $this->lang->load('example');\n        }\n}\n\n```\n\nBut when I rename the method to Foo/foo, the construct doesn't run.\n\n**Example Error output**\n\n```\nA PHP Error was encountered\nSeverity: Notice\nMessage: Undefined property: Foo::$lang\nFilename: controllers/Foo.php\nLine Number: 20\n\n( ! ) Fatal error: Call to a member function load() on a non-object in
