subject function of Email class sometimes breaks multibyte subject by splitting it at middle of a single multibyte character.\n\nTo regenerate this issue, placing the following code in the controller

$this->email->subject('これは日本語のテストです');\n        var_dump($this->email->_headers);\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThen access to it and you will see the following result.\n\n```\narray(1) { [\"Subject\"]=>

\"=?utf-8?Q?\" string, should not be splitted since these 3 byte combination means a single Japanese character.\n\nAs long as I tested, Thunderbird and Apple Mail fail to display this encoded subject.\n\nThe easiest fix is to use mb_encode_mimeheader function instead of _prep_q_encoding.\nAccording to the PHP manual, mb_encode_mimeheader folds the line into 74
