The problem is that the update_batch code will only update 100 items at a time per query, so if you 340 items to update, it'll run 4 queries.\n\nHere's the problem loop.\n\n```\nfor ($i = 0, $total = count($this->qb_set); $i < $total; $i += 100)\n{\n        $this->query($this->_update_batch($this->protect_identifiers($table, TRUE, NULL, FALSE), array_slice($this->qb_set, $i, 100), $this->protect_identifiers($index)));\n        $affected_rows += $this->affected_rows();\n}\n```\n\nOnce this loop executes twice, the second query that gets sent has a where clause like this\n\n```\n...\nWHEN `id` = '196' THEN 4655\nWHEN `id` = '197' THEN 215\nWHEN `id` = '198' THEN 1818\nWHEN `id` = '199' THEN 4721\nWHEN `id` = '200' THEN 939\nELSE `views` END\nWHERE `\nAND `id` IN('101','102','103','104','105','106','107','108','109','110','111','112','113','114','115','116','117','118','119','120','121','122','123','124','125','126','127','128','129','130','131','132','133','134','135','136','137','138','139','140','141','142','143','144','145','146','147','148','149','150','151','152','153','154','155','156','157','158','159','160','161','162','163','164','165','166','167','168','169','170','171','172','173','174','175','176','177','178','179','180','181','182','183','184','185','186','187','188','189','190','191','192','193','194','195','196','197','198','199','200')\n```\n\nTo fix the issue, I had to reset qb_where after every iteration of the loop like so\n\n```\nfor ($i = 0, $total = count($this->qb_set); $i < $total; $i += 100)\n{\n        $this->query($this->_update_batch($this->protect_identifiers($table, TRUE, NULL, FALSE), array_slice($this->qb_set, $i, 100), $this->protect_identifiers($index)));\n        $affected_rows += $this->affected_rows();\n        $this->qb_where = array(); // this line was added\n}\n```\n","closed_by":{"login":"narfbg","id":1058011,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNTgwMTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1058011?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg","html_url":"https://github.com/narfbg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bcit-ci/CodeIgniter/issues/2501/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bcit-ci/CodeIgniter/issues/2501/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
