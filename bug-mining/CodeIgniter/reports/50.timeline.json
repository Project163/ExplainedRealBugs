know this method doesn't break HTML entities that start \"&\".\n\nBut if we have a \"textarea\" in our form, after posting and passing Validate::run() and it is repopulated,  HTML entities that start \"&\" are displayed as entities (i.e. the string of \"&section\" is displayed as \"§ion\" in textarea, because CI  dosn't escape \"&\" but there is no problem in the textbox).\n\nSo I think this behavior is a bug and CI(Validator) should use the \"htmlspecialchars\" method in this case.\n\nI think that Validator class must not escape contents but they must be escaped in the template. \nit'll be better that CI offers the alias method of \"htmlspecialchars\", like \"h()\"
