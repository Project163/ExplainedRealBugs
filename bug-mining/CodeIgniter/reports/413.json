When a group of transaction is started the following SQL is run;\n\n> \"TRANSACTION START\"\n\nAs each group of transactions is completed/committed the following SQL is run;\n\n> \"COMMIT; SET AUTOCOMMIT=1\"\n\nFrom the Mysql documentation;\n\n> \"COMMIT commits the current transaction, making its changes permanent\"\n\nIt that point any queries run after the \"START TRANSACTION\" will be permanent. There is no way to roll them back.\n# Solution:\n\nSince it is impossible to fulfill the current description, the documentation needs to change to say the following;\n\n> \"When strict mode is enabled, if you are running multiple groups of transactions, if one group fails all **subsequent** groups will be rolled back.\"\n","closed_by":{"login":"narfbg","id":1058011,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNTgwMTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1058011?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg","html_url":"https://github.com/narfbg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bcit-ci/CodeIgniter/issues/4032/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bcit-ci/CodeIgniter/issues/4032/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
