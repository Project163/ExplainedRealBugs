It works fine when I run the SQL query in SQL Developer, however it gives the error when viewing the page in the browser (through PHP and CodeIgniter).\n\n```\nA PHP Error was encountered\nSeverity: Warning\nMessage: oci_fetch_assoc(): ORA-01002: fetch out of sequence\nFilename: oci8/oci8_result.php\nLine Number: 155\n```\n\nI checked the following thread on the Forums (http://codeigniter.com/forums/viewthread/208846/) and it seems one solution is to put the `@` character in front of `oci_fetch_assoc($id)` on **line 155** of the `oci8_result.php` file.\n\nSo the function would now be\n\n``` php\n/**\n * Result - associative array\n *\n * Returns the result set as an array\n *\n * @access  protected\n * @return  array\n */\nprotected function _fetch_assoc()\n{\n    $id = ($this->curs_id) ? $this->curs_id : $this->stmt_id;\n    return @oci_fetch_assoc($id);\n}\n```\n\nNot sure why this warning is being caused or what other solution there is.\n\nAs some added information. I am running my application on **Ubuntu 10.04.3 LTS** with **PHP 5.3.2-1ubuntu4.17** and the Oracle database is version **10g**.\n","closed_by":{"login":"narfbg","id":1058011,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNTgwMTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1058011?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg","html_url":"https://github.com/narfbg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bcit-ci/CodeIgniter/issues/1701/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bcit-ci/CodeIgniter/issues/1701/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
