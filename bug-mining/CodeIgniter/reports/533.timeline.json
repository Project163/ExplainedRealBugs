So due to this even the connection establish call had failed as I could see errors in the logs for that. Hence it wasn't the case that connection was established and the ```sMembers()``` call failed a millisecond later.\r\n\r\nAccording to me, CI handling the exception would be beneficial, as I too was expecting redis calls to just return false in case if they fail. A simple log_message like the one's for connection establish seems good for debugging. However I can understand other developers might expect different behavior. So the decision is up to the community & contributors. Feel free to close if this issue if needed.\r\n\r\nOut of curiosity, I tried modifying the redis cache driver myself so that the ```sMembers()``` call in question doesn't throw an exception.\r\nBut then any call to redis like ```$this->cache->redis->save('foo', 'bar', 10);``` throws an exception on line 193 ```$this->_redis->set($id, $data, $ttl);``` and line 325 ```$this->_redis->close();```.\r\nSo for CI to handle redis exceptions, along with the sMembers call, all the other functions called using _redis in the cache driver would need to be in try-catch too.\r\nOr alternatively, users can just put their calls to the driver like ```$this->cache->redis->save()``` in the try-catch block.\r\n\r\nAbout the screenshot of code, will keep in mind.","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bcit-ci/CodeIgniter/issues/comments/418497341/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"thorium369","id":37650333,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3NjUwMzMz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/37650333?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/thorium369","html_url":"https://github.com/thorium369","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thorium369/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thorium369/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thorium369/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thorium369/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thorium369/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thorium369/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thorium369/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thorium369/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thorium369/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":1826200816,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MTgyNjIwMDgxNg==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bcit-ci/CodeIgniter/issues/events/1826200816","actor":{"login":"narfbg","id":1058011,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNTgwMTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1058011?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg","html_url":"https://github.com/narfbg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-09-04T19:55:43Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":1826200817,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDE4MjYyMDA4MTc=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bcit-ci/CodeIgniter/issues/events/1826200817","actor":{"login":"narfbg","id":1058011,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNTgwMTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1058011?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg","html_url":"https://github.com/narfbg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-09-04T19:55:43Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bcit-ci/CodeIgniter/issues/comments/418742732","html_url":"https://github.com/bcit-ci/CodeIgniter/issues/5562#issuecomment-418742732","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bcit-ci/CodeIgniter/issues/5562","id":418742732,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQxODc0MjczMg==","user":{"login":"narfbg","id":1058011,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNTgwMTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1058011?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg","html_url":"https://github.com/narfbg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-09-05T14:03:15Z","updated_at":"2018-09-05T14:03:15Z","body":"I
