Create a table with a nullable column and fill it with some null values.\r\n2. Create a migration to change the name of the nullable column and run it.\r\n\r\nExample migration up:\r\n```\r\n$fields = array(\r\n        'example_field' => array(\r\n\t\t'name' => 'example_field_new',\r\n\t\t'null' => TRUE\r\n\t),\r\n );\r\n$this->dbforge->modify_column('example_table', $fields);\r\n```\r\n## Bug\r\nDigging in the code I found that the condition on this line is always `FALSE`:\r\nhttps://github.com/bcit-ci/CodeIgniter/blob/b1769f962d74adff766666e2b3e055191bf94b63/system/database/drivers/postgre/postgre_forge.php#L134\r\n\r\nThe reason for this is that this line sets the 'null' property to a string, breaking the previous condition:\r\nhttps://github.com/bcit-ci/CodeIgniter/blob/b1769f962d74adff766666e2b3e055191bf94b63/system/database/DB_forge.php#L754\r\n\r\nThis leads to a situation in column modification will trigger a `SET NOT NULL` in all cases, and it doesn't matter if the `null` attribute is set to `TRUE`. I bet this only happens in PostgreSQL because of the syntax.\r\n\r\n## Workaround\r\n1. Load your database in __construct()\r\n```\r\n$this->db = $this->load->database('default', TRUE);\r\n```\r\n2. Run a raw query in up() and another in down()\r\n```\r\n$this->db->query('ALTER TABLE \"example_table\" RENAME COLUMN \"example_field\" TO \"example_field_new\"');\r\n```\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"narfbg","id":1058011,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNTgwMTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1058011?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg","html_url":"https://github.com/narfbg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bcit-ci/CodeIgniter/issues/5542/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bcit-ci/CodeIgniter/issues/5542/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
