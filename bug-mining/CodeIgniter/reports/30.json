To further solidify that is should be insert_batch() the MYSQL code begins with INSERT INTO mytable. I am curious to how the real update_batch() function works. The file DB_active_rec.php shows the funciton update_batch($table = '', $set = NULL, $index = NULL) with three arguments the sample code only shows 2.\n\nI just figured out how to use the update_batch() function the third parameter is the where column your updating by.
