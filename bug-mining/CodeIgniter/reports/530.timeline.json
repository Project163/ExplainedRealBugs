wrote in https://github.com/bcit-ci/CodeIgniter/pull/5888\r\n> Sorry, but your patch does the opposite of what it should be doing ... see 4fc777a for the correct fix.\r\n\r\nYour fix is ok, but i´m pretty sure that you are mistaken on that. I totally understand how you arrived at this misconception, thats one of the reasons PHP deprecated this notation. The previous code `$this->_compile_{$section}` implicitly creates an array under the name `$this->_compile_` and then sets values by using `$section` as key.  Your fixed code now created multiple properties with different names, each concatenations of `'_compile_'` and `$section`. \r\n\r\nNevertheless thanks for fixing this issue by removing the deprecated notation 👍
