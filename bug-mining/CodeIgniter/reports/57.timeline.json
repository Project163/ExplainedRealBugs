could be related to #182 and #682:\n\nin oci8_result, the function num_rows runs queries again before returning (note #682 is still open, so I have changed the return call to be return $this->num_rows)\n\n``` php\n    public function num_rows()\n    {\n        if ($this->num_rows === 0 && count($this->result_array()) > 0)\n        {\n            $this->num_rows =

      return $this->num_rows(); // is currently \"return $rowcount\" which is a bug as noted above\n    }\n```\n\nWhen these queries are run, they are committed (and not treated as part of the transaction). This issue is present even if num_rows() is never called directly, so I have a feeling num_rows() is called from somewhere else in the database library (either somewhere in $this->db->query(), or in $resultSet->result()).\n\nThus, num_rows() will break a transaction lock. I noticed this when trying to do update BLOB columns in my database (which require row lock).\n\nThe code I was trying to run is:\n\n``` php\n$empty_blob_set = $this->db->query('SELECT photo FROM images WHERE photo_id = ?', $photoId);\nforeach($empty_blob_set->result_array() as $row) {\n    $blob = $row['PHOTO'];\n    $blob->write($imageAsString);\n}\n```\n\nWhat is the purpose of running the\n\n``` php\n@oci_execute($this->stmt_id);\nif ($this->curs_id)\n{\n    @oci_execute($this->curs_id);\n}\n```\n\nblock? If I change the @oci_execute to use OCI_DEFAULT (and thus not commit), the issue appears to go away (but removing the @oci_execute entirely means empty results are returned by $this->db->query() calls). I don't know what side-effects OCI_DEFAULT has, as I'm not sure why the @oci_execute calls are there, so this isn't really a fix.\n# EDIT\n\nAfter digging through the code for a bit, it appears that in DB_driver.php, line 386, after the result ojbect is instantiated, the call to num_rows() forces a call (via oci8_result.php line 45) to `result_array()`, which calls `_fetch_assoc()` to build the array.\nThis means that the cursor is moved to the end of the OCI result object with `oci_feth_assoc()`.\nThen when, later on, `$resultSet->results()` is called, a results object cannot be build because the `oci_fetch_object()` call in `result_object()` and then `_fetch_object()` returns FALSE, since no more rows are available in the OCI result object.\n\nThis can be verified by using only `$resultSet->result_array()`. Since this array is already built, it will work as intended, while `$resultSet->result()`, which uses a result object, will be broken since the result object cannot be assembled.\n\nIn conclusion, this block in oci8_results.php num_rows function:\n\n``` php\n@oci_execute($this->stmt_id);\nif ($this->curs_id)\n{\n    @oci_execute($this->curs_id);\n}\n```\n\nexists only to move the cursor back to the beginning of the result set. I therefore propose that calling the oci_execute methods with OCI_NO_AUTO_COMMIT (or equivalently OCI_DEFAULT) is a suitable workaround, since it's acceptable to always not commit this query, since it will only ever apply to SELECT statements and only needs to be committed when other changes are made (and will be committed in that case, when the change is committed).\n\nI'll do some testing to make sure this all works, and then write a fix.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bcit-ci/CodeIgniter/issues/696/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bcit-ci/CodeIgniter/issues/696/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"actor":{"login":"narfbg","id":1058011,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNTgwMTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1058011?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg","html_url":"https://github.com/narfbg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2012-01-05T20:13:14Z","updated_at":"2012-01-05T20:13:14Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bcit-ci/CodeIgniter/issues/868","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bcit-ci/CodeIgniter","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bcit-ci/CodeIgniter/issues/868/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bcit-ci/CodeIgniter/issues/868/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bcit-ci/CodeIgniter/issues/868/events","html_url":"https://github.com/bcit-ci/CodeIgniter/pull/868","id":2739876,"node_id":"MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0NjU3MTc3","number":868,"title":"Improve

include:\n- `oci_execute()` related:\n  - Moved the call from `num_rows()` to `_data_seek()`, as it's purpose is to reset the internal pointer to zero. It's now only called by `CI_DB_oci8_driver::_execute()` (as it should). `_data_seek()` is left there for consistency and isn't called anywhere. This was the main reason for every performance problem with this driver.\n  - If we're using PHP version >= 5.3.2 - we'll now utilize the new `OCI_NO_AUTO_COMMIT` mode flag instead of `OCI_DEFAULT`, which is left as an alias.\n  - Now only pass the mode flag if we are in the middle of a transaction (see the notes about `OCI_NO_AUTO_COMMIT` in [php.net](http://www.php.net/manual/en/function.oci-execute.php) for details). `OCI_COMMIT_ON_SUCCESS` is the default, so it doesn't need to be explicitly set.\n- `num_rows()` related:\n  - Now must be called explicitly (used to be automatically called by `CI_DB_driver`) to avoid `result_array` be set every time while it might not be needed (another possible performance glitch).\n  - The `num_rows` property is now set to `NULL` by default, so we can have a way to know if 0 is the actual count or we have to get it. Also put multiple hooks for this to be set by other methods. Of course - this still doesn't allow `num_rows()` to be used to check before actual data is fetched (as in other database drivers), because we still need to actually do a `count()` on the result set. I hope that Oracle will some day release a solution for this.\n  - Added an oracle-specific note to the `num_rows()` documentation.\n- `free_result()` now really frees `stmt_id` and/or `curs_id`, if they are valid resources. Until now it did a check if `result_id` is a resource and try to clear it, but that's actually a boolean value.\n- Added `custom_result_object()` and all of the row-fetching methods instead of using the parents from `CI_DB_result`. The new ones only fetch rows when needed, follow `current_row` on their own (we don't want to use `_data_seek()`) and cast from/to arrays/objects when needed. This should also significantly improve performance for those who like to deal with single rows at a time.\n- Added `DROP TABLE` support in `CI_DB_oci8_forge`.\n- Added `_list_databases()` support in `CI_DB_oci8_utility`.\n- Fixed some typos and cleaned up some comments, spaces, unneeded expressions, etc.\n\nI know it's a rather large patch to review/merge, but in order to avoid calling `oci_execute()` multiple times - pretty much all of it should be done at once, so there's no way around it. Plus it should solve every oci8-related issue so far reported.\n\nI've tested most of the stuff (actually, all but DB forge and DB utility) - it works, so ... I hope it doesn't take too much time to review. Any suggestions are welcome. :)\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bcit-ci/CodeIgniter/issues/868/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bcit-ci/CodeIgniter/issues/868/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":10322711,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MTAzMjI3MTE=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bcit-ci/CodeIgniter/issues/events/10322711","actor":{"login":"narfbg","id":1058011,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNTgwMTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1058011?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg","html_url":"https://github.com/narfbg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2012-02-27T21:08:16Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":25652733,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDI1NjUyNzMz","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bcit-ci/CodeIgniter/issues/events/25652733","actor":{"login":"Dentxinho","id":1199765,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExOTk3NjU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1199765?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Dentxinho","html_url":"https://github.com/Dentxinho","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Dentxinho/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Dentxinho/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Dentxinho/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Dentxinho/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Dentxinho/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Dentxinho/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Dentxinho/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Dentxinho/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Dentxinho/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"8def16c7a0a7a0457ba1e8613844a106784a38bc","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Dentxinho/CodeIgniter/commits/8def16c7a0a7a0457ba1e8613844a106784a38bc","created_at":"2012-09-28T14:51:14Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
