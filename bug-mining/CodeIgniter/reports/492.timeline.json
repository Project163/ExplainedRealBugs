to all of you who work to keep CodeIgniter running!\r\n\r\nIn an earlier bug report/issue (https://github.com/bcit-ci/CodeIgniter/issues/5057) there was discussion about the list of options currently supported in the Postgres libpq-connect string. In my own app I'm using the 'sslrootcert' option. I went to the Postgres documentation to see what else is allowed: https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.1/static/libpq-connect.html\r\n\r\nI have updated the list to include all valid options. I'm thinking the purpose of the foreach loop is to prevent programmers/whoever from generating non-valid options to postgres. The way it stands now it prevents valid (and in my case necessary) options.\r\n\r\nBTW, it is not a big deal for me to just patch the core with my own option list ... and as far as I can tell, I'm the only person on the planet who uses this section of code! :-) Part of me is not particularly thrilled that I will have to go through such a long list every time I connect to the db. Anyway, let me know your thoughts ... I'm fine with whatever gets decided.\r\n\r\nP.S.
