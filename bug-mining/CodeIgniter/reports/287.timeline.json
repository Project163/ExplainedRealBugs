`get_compiled_select('', FALSE)` does indeed not reset the select, but it generates errors on the next `get()` or `count_all_results()` if a where() clause is included.\n\nI've been trying to modify the `count_all_results()` method to also include a reset_select override. The problem is the `_compile_select()` method, because it escapes identifiers and compiles various parts of the query (<i><b>edit</b>: it collapses the qb_where, qb_group_by and other arrays</i>). Any next call to QB, including a where clause, to get or count rows will generate an error on compile methods, because the parts are already compiled.\n### Reproduce error\n\nThere are several issues:\n\n``` php\n        // issue 1: multiple table names are being added\n        $foo = $this->db\n          ->select('id, title');\n        echo '<br>' . $foo->get_compiled_select('agenda', FALSE);\n        echo '<br>' . $foo->get_compiled_select('agenda', FALSE);\n        echo '<br>' . $foo->get_compiled_select('agenda', FALSE);\n\n        // result:\n        // SELECT `id`, `title` FROM `agenda`\n        // SELECT `id`, `title` FROM `agenda`, `agenda`\n        // SELECT `id`, `title` FROM `agenda`, `agenda`, `agenda`\n```\n\n.\n\n``` php\n        // issue 2: adding where clause causes errors\n        // (include a from('agenda') to work-around issue 1)\n        $foo = $this->db\n          ->select('id, title')\n          ->from('agenda')\n          ->where('id', 938);\n        echo '<br>' . $foo->get_compiled_select('', FALSE);\n        echo '<br>' . $foo->get_compiled_select('', FALSE); // or $foo->get();\n\n        // result:\n        // SELECT `id`, `title` FROM `agenda`\n        //  | PHP Error was encountered\n        //  | Message: Illegal string offset 'escape'\n        //  | Filename: database/DB_query_builder.php\n```\n### Workaround\n\nThe count_all_results doesn't have a reset_select override<sup>(1)</sup>. When i tried to implement a simple reset=false, like in compile_select, was when i stumbled on the above issues. A work-around is to first store all the query parts, and restore them after the count query has run.\n\n``` php\n    public function count_all_results($table = '', $reset_select = TRUE)\n    {\n        if ($reset_select == FALSE)\n        {\n            // NEW: store the values before running the query\n            $temp = array(\n                'qb_select'         => $this->qb_select,\n                'qb_from'           => $this->qb_from,\n                'qb_join'           => $this->qb_join,\n                'qb_where'          => $this->qb_where,\n                'qb_groupby'        => $this->qb_groupby,\n                'qb_having'         => $this->qb_having,\n                'qb_orderby'        => $this->qb_orderby,\n                'qb_aliased_tables' => $this->qb_aliased_tables,\n                'qb_no_escape'      => $this->qb_no_escape,\n                'qb_distinct'       => $this->qb_distinct,\n                'qb_limit'          => $this->qb_limit,\n                'qb_offset'         => $this->qb_offset,\n            );\n        }\n\n        if ($table !== '')\n        {\n            $this->_track_aliases($table);\n            $this->from($table);\n        }\n\n        $result = ($this->qb_distinct === TRUE)\n            ? $this->query($this->_count_string.$this->protect_identifiers('numrows').\"\\nFROM (\\n\".$this->_compile_select().\"\\n) CI_count_all_results\")\n            : $this->query($this->_compile_select($this->_count_string.$this->protect_identifiers('numrows')));\n\n        if ($reset_select)\n        {\n            $this->_reset_select();\n        }\n        else\n        {\n            // NEW: restore the values\n            $this->_reset_run($temp);\n        }\n\n        if ($result->num_rows() === 0)\n        {\n            return 0;\n        }\n\n        $row = $result->row();\n        return (int) $row->numrows;\n    }\n```\n\n_<sup>(1)</sup>Note: the override for reset_select in  `count_all_results()` from #1982 seems never to have been implemented / merged._\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bcit-ci/CodeIgniter/issues/2405/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bcit-ci/CodeIgniter/issues/2405/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bcit-ci/CodeIgniter/issues/comments/18461316","html_url":"https://github.com/bcit-ci/CodeIgniter/issues/2406#issuecomment-18461316","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bcit-ci/CodeIgniter/issues/2406","id":18461316,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE4NDYxMzE2","user":{"login":"GDmac","id":156334,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1NjMzNA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/156334?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/GDmac","html_url":"https://github.com/GDmac","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GDmac/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GDmac/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GDmac/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GDmac/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GDmac/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GDmac/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GDmac/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GDmac/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GDmac/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2013-05-26T10:53:47Z","updated_at":"2013-05-26T10:53:47Z","body":"@narfbg have you any update on this patch?

trick to remember. Then, i don't think there is a need for count on the cached vars at all, isn't qb_cache_exists enough?
