am not reporting this as a bug, I was messing with apache configurations & disabled suphp which created a session with the apache user information, after re-enabling suphp which switched to my userid I've got these errors from session files driver.\n\nThis one is normal:\n\n```\nSeverity: Warning\nMessage: fopen(/var/lib/php5/ci_session1df5c5147c908bc476d886e8cb106942ac5022a4): failed to open stream: Permission denied\nFilename: drivers/Session_files_driver.php\nLine Number: 162\n```\n\nbut these, should be handled differently as on line 162 we are returning boolean, but it's never checked afterwards, which causes the following errors to appear:\n\n```\nSeverity: Warning\nMessage: rewind() expects parameter 1 to be resource, boolean given\nFilename: drivers/Session_files_driver.php\nLine Number: 188\n```\n\n```\nSeverity: Warning\nMessage: fread() expects parameter 1 to be resource, boolean given\nFilename: drivers/Session_files_driver.php\nLine

one).\n","closed_by":{"login":"narfbg","id":1058011,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNTgwMTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1058011?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg","html_url":"https://github.com/narfbg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bcit-ci/CodeIgniter/issues/4039/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bcit-ci/CodeIgniter/issues/4039/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
