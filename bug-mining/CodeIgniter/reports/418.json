Then once stuck in the loop you cannot login at all. This happens in Chrome + Safari, Firefox on Mac.\n\nI have also attached mysql general log:\nhttps://www.dropbox.com/s/0jsrr85a1aoq6z5/mysql_general_log_ci_3_php_7.txt?dl=0\n\nPHP 7 is from homebrew (RC 4)\nhttps://www.dropbox.com/s/3h3p08nuxz51j3u/Screenshot%202015-10-17%2023.02.18.png?dl=0\n\nThis does not happen in php 5.x. I am also using mysql 5.6\n\nSeems to be related to:\n\n```\npublic function sess_regenerate($destroy = FALSE)\n{\n    $_SESSION['__ci_last_regenerate'] = time();\n    session_regenerate_id($destroy);\n}\n```\n\nIf I comment that part out; it works. Not sure if it is a php bug or not; but thought I would share.\n","closed_by":{"login":"narfbg","id":1058011,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNTgwMTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1058011?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg","html_url":"https://github.com/narfbg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/narfbg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bcit-ci/CodeIgniter/issues/4179/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bcit-ci/CodeIgniter/issues/4179/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
