am upgrading from CI2 to CI3 and encountered a problem with my old database-queries. There are several occasions where I build queries using active record / query builder with select-statements containing aliases (SQL: AS). They can be devided in two types:\nType 1: `\"table\".\"column\" AS \"alias\"`\nAnd Type 2: `\"table\".\"column\" AS \"prefix.alias\"`\n\nType 1 works, type 2 gets escaped the wrong way. query builder generates `\"table\".\"column\" AS \"prefix\".\"alias\"`, it adds two \" around the .\n\nI didn't find anything about aliases in the query builder documentation, except for select_avg, etc. \nI really think this is a bug. I am not certain if my usage was \"wrong\" in the first place, but I need these prefixed aliases anyway ;)\n\nExample Code\n\n``` php\n$a = $data = $this->db->select('table.\"column\" as \"prefix.alias\"')->get(\"table\");\nvar_dump($a);\n```\n\noutputs\n\n``` sql\nSELECT \"table\".\"column\" as \"prefix\".\"alias\" FROM
