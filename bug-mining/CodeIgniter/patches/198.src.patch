+
+Historically, CodeIgniter has always provided the **:any** wildcard in routing,
+with the intention of providing a way to match any character **within** an URI segment.
+
+However, the **:any** wildcard is actually just an alias for a regular expression
+and used to be executed in that manner as **.+**. This is considered a bug, as it
+also matches the / (forward slash) character, which is the URI segment delimiter
+and that was never the intention. In CodeIgniter 3, the **:any** wildcard will now
+represent **[^/]+**, so that it will not match a forward slash.
+
+There are certainly many developers that have utilized this bug as an actual feature.
+If you're one of them and want to match a forward slash, please use the **.+**
