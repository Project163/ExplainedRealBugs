+Handling Multiple Languages
+***************************
+
+If you want to support multiple languages in your application, you would provide folders inside
+your **application/language/** directory for each of them, and you would specify the default 
+language in your **application/config/config.php**.
+
+The **application/language/english/** directory would contain any additional language files
+needed by your application, for instance for error messages.
+
+Each of the other idiom-specific directories would contain the core language files that you
+obtained from the translations repositories, or that you translated yourself, as well as
+any additional ones needed by your application.
+
+You would store the language you are currently using, for instance in a session variable.
+
+Sample Language Files
+=====================

+********************
+Internationalization
+********************
+
+The Language class in CodeIgniter is meant to provide an easy and lightweight way to support multiple
+languages in your application. It is not meant to be a full implementation of what is commonly called
+`internationalization and localization <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internationalization_and_localization>`_.
+
+We use the term "idiom" to refer to a language using its common name, 
+rather than using any of the international standards, such as "en", "en-US", or "en-CA-x-ca" for English
+and some of its variants.
+
+.. note:: There is nothing to prevent you from using those abbreviations in your application!
