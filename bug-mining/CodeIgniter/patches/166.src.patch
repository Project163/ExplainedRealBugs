    -  :doc:`Image Manipulation library <libraries/image_lib>` changes include:
 	 -  The initialize() method now only sets existing class properties.
-	 -  Added support for 3-length hex color values for wm_font_color and wm_shadow_color properties, as well as validation for them.
-	 -  Class properties wm_font_color, wm_shadow_color and wm_use_drop_shadow are now protected, to avoid breaking the text_watermark() method if they are set manually after initialization.
-	 -  If property maintain_ratio is set to TRUE, image_reproportion() now doesn't need both width and height to be specified.
-	 -  Property maintain_ratio is now taken into account when resizing images using ImageMagick library
