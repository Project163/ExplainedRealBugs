+      <p>There are several different dialects of the TAR format, maybe
+      even different TAR formats. The tar package contains special
+      cases in order to read many of the existing dialects and will by
+      default try to create archives in the original format (often
+      called "ustar"). This original format didn't support file names
+      longer than 100 characters or bigger than 8 GiB and the tar
+      package will by default fail if you try to write an entry that
+      goes beyond those limits. "ustar" is the common denominator of
+      all the existing tar dialects and is understood by most of the
+      existing tools.</p>
 
       <p>The tar package does not support the full POSIX tar standard
       nor more modern GNU extension of said standard.</p>
