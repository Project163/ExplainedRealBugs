- * {@link java.util.zip.GZIPInputStream} doesn't decompress concatenated .gz files: it stops after the first member and silently ignores the rest. It doesn't
- * leave the read position to point to the beginning of the next member, which makes it difficult workaround the lack of concatenation support.
