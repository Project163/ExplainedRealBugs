+You can influence the way extra fields are parsed in more detail by
+using the new getExtraFields(ExtraFieldParsingBehavior) method of
+ZipArchiveEntry now.

+Some of the ZIP extra fields related to strong encryption will now
+throw ZipExceptions rather than ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsExceptions in
+certain cases when used directly. There is no practical difference
+when they are read via ZipArchiveInputStream or ZipFile.
