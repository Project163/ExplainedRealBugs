The issue is still there as the access to constructor is prohibited.\r\n\r\nAnswering to \"I know it is done, but I am not quite sure why.\". In most cases the answer is simplicity. One annotation and it's done, but there is more. Consider that this way you could have different deserializers for the same type (even in single class):\r\n```\r\n\r\nclass MyClass {\r\n  @JsonSerialize(using = YearMonthSerializer.class)\r\n  @JsonDeserialize(using = YearMonthDeserializer.class)\r\n  private final YearMonth period;\r\n\r\n  @JsonSerialize(using = MyCustomMonthSerializer.class)\r\n  @JsonDeserialize(using = MyCustomMonthDeserializer.class)\r\n  private final YearMonth anotherField;\r\n\r\n}\r\n\r\n```\r\nI did not dig into the topic, but AFAIK I could reigister only one deserializer per type, so I would need to have the same for both fields and all the classes, which is not always what is really wanted.\r\n\r\nYou can also have a look at other classes in the same package. I have not tested them (but went thorugh the code) and saw private constructors for at least one of them as well, so this might affect serializers and deserializers for other types.","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-modules-java8/issues/comments/763948429/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"walkeros","id":12798132,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNzk4MTMy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12798132?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/walkeros","html_url":"https://github.com/walkeros","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/walkeros/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/walkeros/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/walkeros/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/walkeros/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/walkeros/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/walkeros/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/walkeros/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/walkeros/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/walkeros/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-modules-java8/issues/comments/763964659","html_url":"https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-modules-java8/issues/202#issuecomment-763964659","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-modules-java8/issues/202","id":763964659,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc2Mzk2NDY1OQ==","user":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder","html_url":"https://github.com/cowtowncoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-01-20T21:37:05Z","updated_at":"2021-01-20T21:37:05Z","body":"Makes sense.
