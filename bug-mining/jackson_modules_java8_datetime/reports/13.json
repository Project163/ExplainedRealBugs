This formatter uses `ResolverStyle.STRICT`. \r\n\r\n```\r\n    /**\r\n     * Style to resolve dates and times strictly.\r\n     * <p>\r\n     * Using strict resolution will ensure that all parsed values are within\r\n     * the outer range of valid values for the field. Individual fields may\r\n     * be further processed for strictness.\r\n     * <p>\r\n     * For example, resolving year-month and day-of-month in the ISO calendar\r\n     * system using strict mode will ensure that the day-of-month is valid\r\n     * for the year-month, rejecting invalid values.\r\n     */\r\n    STRICT,\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf I use `@JsonFormat` (i.e. `@JsonFormat(pattern = \"yyyy-MM-dd\", lenient = OptBoolean.FALSE)`) the created DateTimeFormatter uses `ResolverStyle.SMART`. It accepts invalid dates like `2019-11-31`. \r\nThe default formatter does not accept such dates and throws an error.\r\n\r\nTo make the behaviour consistent, I suggest setting the `DateTimeFormatter` to use `ResolverStyle.STRICT` if the lenient attribute is set to `false`.","closed_by":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder","html_url":"https://github.com/cowtowncoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-modules-java8/issues/148/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-modules-java8/issues/148/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
