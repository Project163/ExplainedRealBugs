will fix #180 as well.\r\n\r\nAs the discussion at #175 pointed out this logic already exists in `jackson-datatype-joda`, I checked what is happening there as a starting point. I felt adopting something like `JacksonJodaDateFormat` to here would be a pretty large and complex change, I just added the check for the mapper time zone to the `JSR310FormattedSerializerBase#serialize(...)` method.\r\n\r\nThis changes the serialization behavior a bit. If a zoned date-time value is provided for serialization and there is no explicit time zone setting for the `ObjectMapper` (which means UTC) or any other format (e.g. POJO annotation), then the serialized string will be converted to UTC. Since `jackson-datatype-joda` works the same way, I felt okay with that.\r\n\r\nI adapted every related unit test and added new ones to cover new cases.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-modules-java8/issues/185/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-modules-java8/issues/185/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":3841402751,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDM4NDE0MDI3NTE=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-modules-java8/issues/events/3841402751","actor":{"login":"ferenc-csaky","id":17282839,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MjgyODM5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17282839?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ferenc-csaky","html_url":"https://github.com/ferenc-csaky","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ferenc-csaky/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ferenc-csaky/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ferenc-csaky/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ferenc-csaky/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ferenc-csaky/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ferenc-csaky/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ferenc-csaky/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ferenc-csaky/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ferenc-csaky/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"e12fc9c9e3657af4d77a7781e91b4277d62e716b","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ferenc-csaky/jackson-modules-java8/commits/e12fc9c9e3657af4d77a7781e91b4277d62e716b","created_at":"2020-10-05T16:35:05Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3853085283,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDM4NTMwODUyODM=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-modules-java8/issues/events/3853085283","actor":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder","html_url":"https://github.com/cowtowncoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"ef07d3fb88a298fd8f8b2f1b1ec3ddff895ef5c4","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-modules-java8/commits/ef07d3fb88a298fd8f8b2f1b1ec3ddff895ef5c4","created_at":"2020-10-08T01:13:05Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3853087394,"node_id":"MDE3OlJlbmFtZWRUaXRsZUV2ZW50Mzg1MzA4NzM5NA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-modules-java8/issues/events/3853087394","actor":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder","html_url":"https://github.com/cowtowncoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"renamed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-10-08T01:14:26Z","rename":{"from":"ObjectMapper#setTimeZone

it would seem like #185 (PR for #175) removes the possibility of producing different offset formats with the same ObjectMapper.\r\n\r\nIn the example below you will see 3 cases:\r\n- One using an ObjectMapper without setting it's time zone.\r\n- One using an ObjectMapper with it's time zone set to the value appropriate for the the `offset` field.\r\n- One using an ObjectMapper with it's time zone set to the value appropriate for the the `offset2` field.\r\n\r\nNone of these options seem to work. I think it might just be necessary to honor the given object's timezone when the timezone of the ObjectMapper is not set, I would love to hear your opinion on this or if there's an alternate way to make this work I would also love to hear about it.\r\n\r\nI've added a fourth test case which shows that deserialization is possible when using  `DeserializationFeature.ADJUST_DATES_TO_CONTEXT_TIME_ZONE`. This makes me think that at a higher level the change introduces asymmetry in the behavior, and I think being able to go back and forth preserving the data is important.\r\n\r\nPlease let me know if I can improve this report or assist in any way.\r\n\r\n```\r\nimport static org.junit.Assert.assertEquals;\r\n\r\nimport com.fasterxml.jackson.annotation.*;\r\nimport

documentation\r\n\r\n\r\nFor TimeZone handling, ADJUST_DATES_TO_CONTEXT_TIME_ZONE (default: true) specifies whether the context provided by java.time.TimeZone 'SerializedProvider#getTimeZone()' should be used to adjust Date/Time values on deserialization, even if the value itself contains timezone information. If the value is OffsetDateTime.MIN or OffsetDateTime.MAX, the Date/Time value will not be adjusted. **If disabled, it will only be used if the value itself does not contain any TimeZone information.**\r\n\r\n\r\nHere is my ObjectMapper configuration : \r\n\r\n```java\r\n        final JavaTimeModule module = new JavaTimeModule();\r\n        mapper = new ObjectMapper() //\r\n            .setSerializationInclusion(Include.NON_NULL) //\r\n            .disable(SerializationFeature.WRITE_DATES_AS_TIMESTAMPS) //\r\n            .disable(DeserializationFeature.ADJUST_DATES_TO_CONTEXT_TIME_ZONE) //\r\n            .setTimeZone(TimeZone.getTimeZone(\"Europe/Paris\")) //\r\n            .registerModule(module);\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf I test : \r\n\r\n```\r\n        final BeanForJson bean = new BeanForJson();\r\n        bean.setZonedDateTime(ZonedDateTime.of(2016, 10, 15, 17, 51, 50, 0, ZoneId.of(\"UTC\")));\r\n\r\n        final String json = mapper.writeValueAsString(bean);\r\n        assertThat(json).isEqualTo(\"{\\\"zonedDateTime\\\":\\\"2016-10-15T17:51:50Z\\\"}\");\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nI get : \r\n\r\n```\r\norg.opentest4j.AssertionFailedError: \r\nexpected: \"{\"zonedDateTime\":\"2016-10-15T17:51:50Z\"}\"\r\nbut was : \"{\"zonedDateTime\":\"2016-10-15T19:51:50+02:00\"}\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt is working in 2.11.4 (same use-case).\r\n\r\nThanks","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-modules-java8/issues/221/reactions","total_count":3,"+1":3,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-modules-java8/issues/221/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
