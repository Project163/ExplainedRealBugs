CustomDateTimeDeserializer()))\r\n\t\t.build();\r\n\r\n\r\n\t@Test\r\n\tvoid deserializeSummerTime() throws JsonProcessingException {\r\n\t\tLocalDateTimeObject ldtAmsterdam = JSON_MAPPER.readValue(\"{ \\\"ldt\\\": \\\"2023-04-25T12:39:10Z\\\" }\", LocalDateTimeObject.class);\r\n\t\tassertEquals(LocalDateTime.of(2023, 4, 25, 14, 39, 10), ldtAmsterdam.ldt());\r\n\t}\r\n}\r\n\r\n\trecord LocalDateTimeObject(LocalDateTime ldt) {\r\n\t}`\r\n\r\nAdditionally you can create a overriden deserialize method with random logic and put a breakpoint on a certain line in the method. You will come to find out it never reaches the breakpoint\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-modules-java8/issues/293/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-modules-java8/issues/293/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-modules-java8/issues/comments/1839719532","html_url":"https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-modules-java8/issues/288#issuecomment-1839719532","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-modules-java8/issues/288","id":1839719532,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBFVThM5tp-Rs","user":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder","html_url":"https://github.com/cowtowncoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-12-04T23:30:40Z","updated_at":"2023-12-04T23:30:40Z","body":"And there is at least #293.\r\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-modules-java8/issues/comments/1839719532/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder","html_url":"https://github.com/cowtowncoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-modules-java8/issues/comments/1841735754","html_url":"https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-modules-java8/issues/288#issuecomment-1841735754","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-modules-java8/issues/288","id":1841735754,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBFVThM5txqhK","user":{"login":"mklinkj","id":96992046,"node_id":"U_kgDOBcf7Lg","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/96992046?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mklinkj","html_url":"https://github.com/mklinkj","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mklinkj/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mklinkj/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mklinkj/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mklinkj/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mklinkj/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mklinkj/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mklinkj/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mklinkj/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mklinkj/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-12-05T22:33:35Z","updated_at":"2023-12-05T22:33:35Z","body":"Hello.\r\n\r\nI have confirmed that the method I used before also works well in the 2.16.1-SNAPSHOT version.\r\n\r\n* https://github.com/mklinkj/QnA/commit/26878b3b0bf6329b9eb1827d13caf13a1095674a\r\n\r\nThanks.

Ok, two pointers:\r\n\r\n1. 2.16.1 fixes the issue, so existing usage now works again: not recommended, but supported.\r\n2. For better way, create `SimpleModule` of your own (instead of, or in addition to `JavaTimeModule`) and add custom (de)serializers using that -- same ways you used to add them to `JavaTimeModule` (using methods inherited from `SimpleModule`, in that case)\r\n\r\nSo the only concern is that the fact that `JavaTimeModule` happens to be `SimpleModule` (in 2.x) might lead to usage that will break with 3.x (when `JavaTimeModule` direct implements `Module` and not `SimpleModule`).\r\n\r\nI hope this clarifies matters.\r\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-modules-java8/issues/comments/1882201898/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder","html_url":"https://github.com/cowtowncoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":11424414999,"node_id":"MEE_lADOBFVThM53QZqQzwAAAAKo8r0X","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-modules-java8/issues/events/11424414999","actor":{"login":"mdindoffer","id":12681399,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNjgxMzk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12681399?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdindoffer","html_url":"https://github.com/mdindoffer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdindoffer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdindoffer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdindoffer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdindoffer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdindoffer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdindoffer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdindoffer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdindoffer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdindoffer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2024-01-09T02:19:58Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":11424415002,"node_id":"SE_lADOBFVThM53QZqQzwAAAAKo8r0a","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-modules-java8/issues/events/11424415002","actor":{"login":"mdindoffer","id":12681399,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNjgxMzk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12681399?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdindoffer","html_url":"https://github.com/mdindoffer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdindoffer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdindoffer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdindoffer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdindoffer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdindoffer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdindoffer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdindoffer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdindoffer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdindoffer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2024-01-09T02:19:58Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-modules-java8/issues/comments/1882549679","html_url":"https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-modules-java8/issues/288#issuecomment-1882549679","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-modules-java8/issues/288","id":1882549679,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBFVThM5wNW2v","user":{"login":"mdindoffer","id":12681399,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNjgxMzk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12681399?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdindoffer","html_url":"https://github.com/mdindoffer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdindoffer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdindoffer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdindoffer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdindoffer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdindoffer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdindoffer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdindoffer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdindoffer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdindo
