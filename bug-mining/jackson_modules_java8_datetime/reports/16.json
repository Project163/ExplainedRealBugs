For example `Duration.ofMillis(-1)` gets serialized as \"-1.999000000\"\r\n\r\nProblem seems to be in `DurationSerializer` where following  code is used for serializing\r\n\r\n```\r\n                generator.writeNumber(DecimalUtils.toBigDecimal(\r\n                        duration.getSeconds(), duration.getNano()\r\n                ));\r\n```\r\nHowever `Duration` internally stores duration in format where seconds part basically contains `floor(duration)` and nanoseconds part contains offset from that value to the actual duration. So n case of duration of -1 millisecond, the seconds part value will be -1 and nanoseconds part will be 999000000. `getSeconds()` and `getNano()` return values according to that internal representation, which leads to the problem.","closed_by":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder","html_url":"https://github.com/cowtowncoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-modules-java8/issues/165/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-modules-java8/issues/165/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
