Although perhaps bit misguided, considering the part.\r\n\r\nHowever! I do have one possibly useful idea wrt 2.9.x, your specific use case: there is property `lenient` for `@JsonFormat`; and that defaults to `true`, but may be configured differently at 3 levels: global default, per-type (`LocalDate`) and per-property.\r\nI don't think this is yet supported by this particular deserializer, but it could be; and I think it would make sense... especially if coupled with format `Shape` for deserialization (not just serialization).\r\n\r\nIt is some work but it seems to me like a good way to do this -- my intent going forward is to limit number of on/off feature flags that are type-specific, and `@JsonFormat` (along with Config Overrides that allow specifying overrides for types and global default(s)).\r\n\r\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-modules-java8/issues/comments/371240299/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder","html_url":"https://github.com/cowtowncoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":1509566422,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MTUwOTU2NjQyMg==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-modules-java8/issues/events/1509566422","actor":{"login":"billoneil","id":5205330,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyMDUzMzA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5205330?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/billoneil","html_url":"https://github.com/billoneil","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/billoneil/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/billoneil/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/billoneil/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/billoneil/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/billoneil/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/billoneil/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/billoneil/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/billoneil/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/billoneil/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-03-07T18:41:16Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":1509566424,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDE1MDk1NjY0MjQ=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-modules-java8/issues/events/1509566424","actor":{"login":"billoneil","id":5205330,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyMDUzMzA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5205330?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/billoneil","html_url":"https://github.com/billoneil","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/billoneil/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/billoneil/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/billoneil/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/billoneil/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/billoneil/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/billoneil/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/billoneil/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/billoneil/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/billoneil/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-03-07T18:41:16Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2554660152,"node_id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDI1NTQ2NjAxNTI=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-modules-java8/issues/events/2554660152","actor":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder","html_url":"https://github.com/cowtowncoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-08-13T20:

turns out this bug is already partially fixed. The leniency check is already in the [LocalDateDeserializer](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-modules-java8/blob/a2f6d3441a9c03dcc0b0a498f5b624a44ac4fddf/datetime/src/main/java/com/fasterxml/jackson/datatype/jsr310/deser/LocalDateDeserializer.java#L135):\r\n```\r\n        // 06-Jan-2018, tatu: Is this actually safe? Do users expect such coercion?\r\n        if (parser.hasToken(JsonToken.VALUE_NUMBER_INT)) {\r\n            if (!isLenient()) {\r\n                return _failForNotLenient(parser, context, JsonToken.VALUE_STRING);\r\n            }\r\n            return LocalDate.ofEpochDay(parser.getLongValue());\r\n        }\r\n\r\n```\r\nAs for the Shape of `NUMBER_INT ` requirement, that still needs to be implemented in the Deserializer. Based on the code review, it looks like that was the original intention but it somehow only got to the LocalDateSerializer. Oh, and some documentation and tests of course.\r\n\r\nNow one question - for the Shape, I see the constructor signatures were changed to add that setting, which of course I can follow for the Deserializer, maybe just LocalDateDeserializer as it doesn't need to be any higher at this point. However, I also notice that in the Serializer hierarchy, it is accessible already, as you can see it retrieved in the [JSR310FormattedSerialzerBase.createContextual](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-modules-java8/blob/a2f6d3441a9c03dcc0b0a498f5b624a44ac4fddf/datetime/src/main/java/com/fasterxml/jackson/datatype/jsr310/ser/JSR310FormattedSerializerBase.java#L112) method:\r\n```\r\n       JsonFormat.Value format = findFormatOverrides(prov, property, handledType());\r\n[snip]\r\n            JsonFormat.Shape shape = format.getShape();\r\n```\r\nSo maybe that's a cleaner way to go, but I don't see that same capability in the Deserializer hierarchy.
