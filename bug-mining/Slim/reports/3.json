I am using the following in my `lighttpd.conf`:\n\n```\nurl.rewrite-if-not-file = (\"^/slimapp/.*\" => \"/slimapp/index.php\")\n```\n\nwhere `slimapp` is a subfolder under my document root. Note that `url.rewrite-if-not-file` requires Lighttpd 1.4.24 and up.\n\nIt would be nice to have that in the docs after the Apache rewrite rules for those of us using other servers.\n\nI saw an issue dealing with rewrite rules for nginx in in the tracker here so It'd be nice to have that docs too.\n","closed_by":{"login":"codeguy","id":31677,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxNjc3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/31677?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codeguy","html_url":"https://github.com/codeguy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codeguy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codeguy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codeguy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codeguy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codeguy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codeguy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codeguy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codeguy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codeguy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/slimphp/Slim/issues/175/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/slimphp/Slim/issues/175/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
