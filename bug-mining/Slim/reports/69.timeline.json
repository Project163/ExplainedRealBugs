issue is that Errors are now exceptions in PHP 7, but while they implement Throwable, they don't extend Exception. A third party library I was using caught an error (which was in fact trying to use a class that wasn't loaded I think) and wrapped it in an Exception. The Slim exception handler in Slim\\Handlers\\Error loops around previous exceptions and tries to render them, but the method that does this type hints for Exception rather than Throwable, so when it gets to the PHP Error at the bottom of the stack it fails the type hint. Changing the type hint to Throwable works, because this covers Error and Exception.","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/slimphp/Slim/issues/comments/263081977/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"chrisemerson","id":4631704,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ2MzE3MDQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4631704?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisemerson","html_url":"https://github.com/chrisemerson","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisemerson/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisemerson/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisemerson/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisemerson/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisemerson/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisemerson/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisemerson/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisemerson/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisemerson/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/slimphp/Slim/issues/comments/263082069","html_url":"https://github.com/slimphp/Slim/issues/1943#issuecomment-263082069","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/slimphp/Slim/issues/1943","id":263082069,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2MzA4MjA2OQ==","user":{"login":"akrabat","id":33135,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzMTM1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/33135?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/akrabat","html_url":"https://github.com/akrabat","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akrabat/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akrabat/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akrabat/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akrabat/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akrabat/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akrabat/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akrabat/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akrabat/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akrabat/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-11-26T19:47:57Z","updated_at":"2016-11-26T19:47:57Z","body":"We can't change the type hint to Throwable as that won't work in PHP 5.6.
