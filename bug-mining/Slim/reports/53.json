This doesn't work:\n\n``` php\n// config.php\nreturn [\n    // Slim configuration.\n    'env' => 'production',\n    // DI classes\n    'logger' => PhpConsole\\Handler::getInstance(),\n];\n\n// index.php\n$app = new \\Slim\\App('config.php');\n$app->logger->debug('test'); // Call fails, but is successful if I add $userSettings to parent::__construct().\n```\n\nOr should this be handled some other way within Slim? The point here is to use DI to pass in environment dependent classes, not hard code them into my index.php file.\n","closed_by":{"login":"silentworks","id":79497,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5NDk3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/79497?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/silentworks","html_url":"https://github.com/silentworks","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/silentworks/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/silentworks/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/silentworks/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/silentworks/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/silentworks/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/silentworks/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/silentworks/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/silentworks/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/silentworks/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/slimphp/Slim/issues/1407/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/slimphp/Slim/issues/1407/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
