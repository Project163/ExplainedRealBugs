To be clear, HTTP headers are case-insensitive. So the only issue here is entirely aesthetic. That being said, I can appreciate the desire to see HTTP headers output exactly as you specify them. Currently, Slim normalizes them into a lower-case canonical form.\n\nSo, what I'll have to do is update the `Slim_Http_Headers` class to store a secondary hash of specified header names that maps the canonical form to the original form. The `Slim_Http_Headers` instance will continue to operate in a case insensitive way accepting either lower-case, mixed-case, or upper-case input.\n\nThe only change will be \"under-the-hood\" and will require a tiny bit more overhead to lookup the original form when headers are ultimately flushed to the HTTP client in `Slim::run()`.\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/slimphp/Slim/issues/comments/3500489/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"codeguy","id":31677,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxNjc3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/31677?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codeguy","html_url":"https://github.com/codeguy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codeguy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codeguy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codeguy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codeguy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codeguy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codeguy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codeguy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codeguy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codeguy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":7932944,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50NzkzMjk0NA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/slimphp/Slim/issues/events/7932944","actor":{"login":"hexa2k9","id":118494,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExODQ5NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/118494?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hexa2k9","html_url":"https://github.com/hexa2k9","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hexa2k9/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hexa2k9/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hexa2k9/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hexa2k9/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hexa2k9/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hexa2k9/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hexa2k9/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hexa2k9/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hexa2k9/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2012-01-15T17:51:00Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":7932945,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDc5MzI5NDU=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/slimphp/Slim/issues/events/7932945","actor":{"login":"codeguy","id":31677,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxNjc3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/31677?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codeguy","html_url":"https://github.com/codeguy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codeguy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codeguy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codeguy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codeguy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codeguy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codeguy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codeguy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codeguy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codeguy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2012-01-15T17:51:00Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":7937664,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50NzkzNzY2NA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/slimphp/Slim/issues/events/7937664","actor":{"login":"codeguy","id":31677,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxNjc3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/31677?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codeguy","html_url":"https://github.com/codeguy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codeguy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codeguy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codeguy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codeguy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codeguy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codeguy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codeguy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codeguy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codeguy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":"98b3f01b1b641eabafcae25ef45ad5987bf1c76d","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/slimphp/Slim/commits/98b3f01b1b641eabafcae25ef45ad5987bf1c76d","created_at":"2012-01-15T21:43:49Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/slimphp/Slim/issues/comments/3502146","html_url":"https://github.co
