And because I alter $env['slim.input'](same thing you did inside ContentTypes middleware) methodOverride doesn't get string from it. \n\nMy basic idea is that API I'm building should always parse and decode json from raw input on POST and PUT. So there is no need to do this in every controler. And then I can use just  $app->request()->getBody() to get this json decoded object.\n\nDo you think my approach is ok or there is better way to get this work.\n","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/slimphp/Slim/issues/comments/5676858/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"urosgruber","id":590455,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5MDQ1NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/590455?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/urosgruber","html_url":"https://github.com/urosgruber","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/urosgruber/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/urosgruber/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/urosgruber/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/urosgruber/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/urosgruber/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/urosgruber/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/urosgruber/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/urosgruber/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/urosgruber/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/slimphp/Slim/issues/comments/5678044","html_url":"https://github.com/slimphp/Slim/issues/297#issuecomment-5678044","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/slimphp/Slim/issues/297","id":5678044,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU2NzgwNDQ=","user":{"login":"codeguy","id":31677,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxNjc3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/31677?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codeguy","html_url":"https://github.com/codeguy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codeguy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codeguy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codeguy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codeguy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codeguy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codeguy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codeguy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codeguy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codeguy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2012-05-13T17:57:22Z","updated_at":"2012-05-13T17:57:22Z","body":"@urosgruber The Method Override middleware does not look at the environment's 'slim.input' variable.
