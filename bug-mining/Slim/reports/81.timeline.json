don't just close the issue. it is not resolved nor completed.\r\n\r\nI get the idea here. but I'm not sure you are correct. for example, there is no need for `suppressDisplayErrorDetailsTip` for sure.\r\n\r\nLet me elaborate.\r\nWhen a log is added, We want to either:\r\n\r\n- Display it\r\n- Write it somewhere.\r\n- Or both\r\n\r\nAlso, regarding the details, We may want to either:\r\n- Show details of a log when displaying it or skip details and display the log without details\r\n- Write the log to a backend with or without details (regardless of how we display it).\r\n\r\nSo, what if I don't want to display the details of a log but I want to write details of the same log to send it to a backend?\r\n\r\nWe need to understand the purpose of the flags:\r\n\r\nThe `displayErrorDetails` flag is for DISPLAYING logs.\r\n\r\nThe `logErrorDetails` flag is for writing the log to a destination.\r\n\r\n\r\nBack to my first post. the condition I mentioned IS NOT  meant for display and the developer must have used `logErrorDetails` to determine if we need log details. but the developer incorrectly used `displayErrorDetails` to determine if we need log details for a log which is never going to be displayed.\r\n\r\nPay attention, the function name is `writeToErrorLog`. That will clarify the incorrect flag usage.\r\n\r\n\r\nPractical Example:\r\nRight now, I have a JSON serializer and I want to add log details. but when JSON is created, the tip is added to the end of the JSON, resulting in an incorrect JSON object.\r\n\r\n\r\nI can send a pull request about this.","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/slimphp/Slim/issues/comments/2089010196/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"mohammadhzp","id":6490286,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0OTAyODY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6490286?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mohammadhzp","html_url":"https://github.com/mohammadhzp","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mohammadhzp/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mohammadhzp/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mohammadhzp/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mohammadhzp/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mohammadhzp/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mohammadhzp/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mohammadhzp/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mohammadhzp/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mohammadhzp/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/slimphp/Slim/issues/comments/2089012361","html_url":"https://github.com/slimphp/Slim/issues/3317#issuecomment-2089012361","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/slimphp/Slim/issues/3317","id":2089012361,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAA4jUM58g8yJ","user":{"login":"mohammadhzp","id":6490286,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0OTAyODY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6490286?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mohammadhzp","html_url":"https://github.com/mohammadhzp","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mohammadhzp/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mohammadhzp/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mohammadhzp/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mohammadhzp/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mohammadhzp/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mohammadhzp/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mohammadhzp/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mohammadhzp/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mohammadhzp/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-05-01T19:53:19Z","updated_at":"2024-05-01T19:53:19Z","body":"Please

Remove [lines 262 to 265](https://github.com/akrabat/Slim/blob/9395e43035b9476749626ec695aff83f0429ca26/Slim/Handlers/ErrorHandler.php#L262-L265) completely\r\n2.

Move the code that adds this message to the `PlainTextRenderer`, but we can't do that as we'd have to change the signature of `ErrorRendererInterface::__invoke()` which is a massive BC break!
