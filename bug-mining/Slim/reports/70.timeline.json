It was not apart of the official HTTP 1.1 spec, however it is possible that there are programs/protocol/etc that use the LINK/UNLINK HTTP verb.\n\nThis particular issue, is uncommon... but seems to occur a few times a year.\n\nThe current work-around is to extend the Request class and add the required HTTP VERBS to the protected member, then replace the Pimple Factory for the Request object with your modified one.\n\nThis is related to: #1927 \n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/slimphp/Slim/issues/comments/251194439/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"geggleto","id":4027602,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwMjc2MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4027602?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/geggleto","html_url":"https://github.com/geggleto","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geggleto/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geggleto/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geggleto/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geggleto/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geggleto/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geggleto/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geggleto/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geggleto/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geggleto/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/slimphp/Slim/issues/comments/251200855","html_url":"https://github.com/slimphp/Slim/issues/2005#issuecomment-251200855","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/slimphp/Slim/issues/2005","id":251200855,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI1MTIwMDg1NQ==","user":{"login":"iansltx","id":472804,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3MjgwNA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/472804?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/iansltx","html_url":"https://github.com/iansltx","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iansltx/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iansltx/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iansltx/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iansltx/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iansltx/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iansltx/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iansltx/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iansltx/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iansltx/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-10-03T19:23:55Z","updated_at":"2016-10-03T19:23:55Z","body":"Yeah, catch with the valid methods add piece is you have to hook into the from-env factory, since you're calling it and the valid methods array isn't static.

are some intiial thoughts:\n- [BC break] Extract `Slim\\Http` into separate PSR-7 component (ONLY PSR-7 methods)\n- [BC break] Create custom decorator classes to hold Slim-specific additions to PSR-7\n- Accommodate additional media type parsers in request\n- Address issues reported by Phan\n- Improve test coverage\n\nAdditional ideas:\n- [BC break] Remove Request, Response and Env from container (@akrabat)\n- [BC break] Don't set content-length by default. Provide a middleware for people to use if they want to. (@akrabat)\n- Make it faster (or at least don't slow it down!) (@Cyrille37)\n- [BC break] Removing Method-Override and providing a middleware (@geggleto)\n- [BC break] Decide if we need `subRequest` at all (@codeguy/@silentworks/@geggleto)\n- Lazy resolve route middlewares (#1635) We already do this with route callable(only resolve the matched one). (@mathmarques)\n- Look at `__invoke` and `run` on `App` and see if we can consolidate functionality and make them easier to unit test. (@geggleto)\n- [BC break] Consolidate error handlers for exceptions and PHP 7 errors (@akrabat)\n- Can we avoid statics in `Slim\\Http`? See #1850 (@Raistlfiren)\n- [BC break] Look at `pathFor()`'s parameters? see #1800 (@akrabat)\n- [BC break] Do something about `basePath` from `Request`. Maybe middleware solution instead? (@akrabat)\n- [BC break] Remove `determineRouteBeforeDispatch` and make routing a middleware that can be placed where you want it to be. If you don't add it yourself, we would add it immediately before dispatch. (@akrabat)\n- Use `getallheaders()` to get the Authorisation header.

resolves #2005. Router map() calls don't have method checking,\r\nand we still don't link the valid methods in the request to valid\r\nmethods at the application level (which IMO should be since the router\r\ndoesn't enforce any sort of method limitation at this point), but now\r\nyou won't get an uncaught exception when someone hits you with an HTTP\r\nmessage with verb CHICKEN.\r\n\r\nAlso revised tests to check app run handling rather than request create\r\nhandling, since internally to the request a bad method should still be\r\ninvalid/throw an exception, so we don't want to weaken that guarantee.\r\nBut we do want the application not to 500 at runtime.\r\n\r\nAlong with that, behavior (as tested) differs between whether we have a\r\nroute or not, since in any other case the former would give you a bad\r\nmethod exception, while the latter would give you a not-found. So these\r\ntweaks match up that behavior for obscure HTTP methods as well.\r\n\r\nFinally, RouterInterface now has constants for route info array returns.\r\nThey're only used on the exceptional path, but they make it a bit\r\nclearer why we're pulling various numeric keys out of the route, rather\r\nthan having a non-obvious contract with FastRoute.\r\n\r\nTook extra care here to respect order of execution for the existing code\r\nso anything relying on that order will still work. Likewise,\r\nInvalidMethodException subclasses InvalidArgumentException and returns\r\nthe same message and code, so anything checking for exception strings\r\netc., as well as instanceof checks, will still work.\r\n\r\nCredit to @nickdnk for building the first red test for this issue.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/slimphp/Slim/issues/2141/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/slimphp/Slim/issues/2141/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/slimphp/Slim/issues/comments/277418207","html_url":"https://github.com/slimphp/Slim/issues/2005#issuecomment-277418207","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/slimphp/Slim/issues/2005","id":277418207,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI3NzQxODIwNw==","user":{"login":"nickdnk","id":8411314,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg0MTEzMTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8411314?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickdnk","html_url":"https://github.com/nickdnk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickdnk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickdnk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickdnk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickdnk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickdnk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickdnk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickdnk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickdnk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nickdnk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-02-04T04:31:10Z","updated_at":"2017-02-04T04:31:10Z","body":"Hey Ian\n\nGreat job fixing this :) I will admit I don't have the knowledge with Slim to go over the code, though.\n\nBut what's the argument for 405 and 404 in the tests?\n\n405 indicates that the server knows the method but doesn't support it on the endpoint.

Adding in a special \"return a 400 if the method isn't on the list\" case would either require adding another exception handler logic block (and tweaking the InvalidMethodException a bit from the way I have it now) or hard-coding a 400 response in a way that would be less configurable. So I went with the way that, if you make a CHICKEN call, you'll get back the same response as if you made a TRACE call (since effectively no one ever implements TRACE).\r\n\r\nI can go into a little more detail on the above, but I feel like I'm blathering on already :p\r\n\r\nNow, re: 400 vs. 404/405 specifically, there are decent cases for remapping the built-in notFoundHandler to return a 400 rather than a 404 anyway if you're working with an API, because the client is giving you a bad request (namely to a route pattern that isn't actually a thing). But semantically the notFoundHandler, which spits out a 404 by default now, is more of a routeDidNotMatchHandler so dumping things into there in this case seems to make sense...and then you can override that to get your 400
