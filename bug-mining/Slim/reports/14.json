Slim_Http_Request should only parse the request body if it is a string and URL encoded. Currently, an upstream middleware layer may parse the request body; downstream middleware should respect upstream changes.\n\nI'm searching for a clue why status is not set correctly to value set inside middleware. I've created a middleware where if things go wrong status is set to 400 and then just return instead of calling next middleware. \n\nIf I check the status and also content type right after Slim echoes $body values are correct but curl outputs status 200 and content type text/html.\n\nAm I missing something here or there is better way to make this work?\n\nThanks, U\n","closed_by":{"login":"codeguy","id":31677,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxNjc3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/31677?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codeguy","html_url":"https://github.com/codeguy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codeguy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codeguy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codeguy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codeguy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codeguy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codeguy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codeguy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codeguy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codeguy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/slimphp/Slim/issues/297/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/slimphp/Slim/issues/297/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
