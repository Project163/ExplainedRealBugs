It seems like group middleware is only running for the first nested group. I.e. `/api/works/test` outputs \"Middleware ran successfully\", but `/api/does_not_work/test` returns an empty response. Here's my code:\r\n\r\n```php\r\nuse Psr\\Http\\Message\\ResponseInterface as Response;\r\nuse Psr\\Http\\Message\\ServerRequestInterface as Request;\r\nuse Psr\\Http\\Server\\RequestHandlerInterface as RequestHandler;\r\nuse Slim\\Factory\\AppFactory;\r\nuse Slim\\Routing\\RouteCollectorProxy;\r\n\r\nrequire '../../vendor/autoload.php';\r\n\r\n$app = AppFactory::create();\r\n\r\n$app->group('/api', function (RouteCollectorProxy $app) {\r\n    $app->group('/works', function (RouteCollectorProxy $app) {\r\n        $app->get('/test', function (Request $request, Response $response) {\r\n            return $response;\r\n        });\r\n    });\r\n\r\n    $app->group('/does_not_work', function (RouteCollectorProxy $app) {\r\n        $app->get('/test', function (Request $request, Response $response) {\r\n            return $response;\r\n        });\r\n    });\r\n})->add(function (Request $request, RequestHandler $handler) {\r\n    $response = $handler->handle($request);\r\n    $response->getBody()->write('Middleware ran successfully');\r\n    return $response;\r\n});\r\n\r\n$app->run();\r\n```","closed_by":{"login":"l0gicgate","id":6510935,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1MTA5MzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6510935?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/l0gicgate","html_url":"https://github.com/l0gicgate","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/l0gicgate/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/l0gicgate/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/l0gicgate/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/l0gicgate/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/l0gicgate/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/l0gicgate/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/l0gicgate/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/l0gicgate/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/l0gicgate/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/slimphp/Slim/issues/2775/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/slimphp/Slim/issues/2775/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
