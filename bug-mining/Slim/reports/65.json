I noticed that `Throwable` exceptions are not caught in `Route.php` on line 324 whereas this case is handle in `App.php`\n\n``` php\n    try {\n        ob_start();\n        $newResponse = $handler($this->callable, $request, $response, $this->arguments);\n        $output = ob_get_clean();\n    } catch (Exception $e) {\n        ob_end_clean();\n        throw $e;\n    }\n```\n\nFor `Throwable` exceptions, `ob_end_clean()` is never called.\n\nIt should be replace by:\n\n``` php\n    try {\n        ob_start();\n        $newResponse = $handler($this->callable, $request, $response, $this->arguments);\n        $output = ob_get_clean();\n    } catch (Exception $e) {\n        ob_end_clean();\n        throw $e;\n    } catch (Throwable $e) {\n        ob_end_clean();\n        throw $e;\n    }\n```\n\nThanks\n","closed_by":{"login":"akrabat","id":33135,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzMTM1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/33135?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/akrabat","html_url":"https://github.com/akrabat","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akrabat/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akrabat/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akrabat/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akrabat/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akrabat/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akrabat/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akrabat/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akrabat/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akrabat/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/slimphp/Slim/issues/1983/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/slimphp/Slim/issues/1983/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
