This behavior leads to the encoding of special characters in log messages and other plain text outputs, which might not be desired in all contexts.\r\n\r\n## Slim Framework Version\r\n4\r\n\r\n## Steps to Reproduce\r\n1. Use the `PlainTextErrorRenderer` to handle exceptions.\r\n2. Trigger an exception with a message that includes characters that are typically encoded by `htmlentities` (like double quotes).\r\n3. Observe the output (in logs, terminal, etc.) and notice that characters are HTML entity encoded (e.g., double quotes are converted to `&quot;`).\r\n\r\n## Expected Behavior\r\nIn a plain text context, one would expect the error message to be rendered as-is, without HTML entity encoding. The use of `htmlentities` might be more appropriate for HTML-specific renderers.\r\n\r\n## Actual Behavior\r\nThe error message is HTML entity encoded, leading to representations like `&quot;` in place of double quotes in plain text outputs.\r\n\r\n## Possible Solution\r\nConsider removing the `htmlentities` call from the `PlainTextErrorRenderer`, or provide an option to disable HTML entity encoding based on the context in which the renderer is used.\r\n\r\n## Context\r\nThis encoding issue affects logging, CLI outputs, and other scenarios where HTML entity encoding is not desirable in error messages.\r\n\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/slimphp/Slim/blob/fdb6d614700a4e9390c3b08dde96e1f9147ec3fc/Slim/Error/Renderers/PlainTextErrorRenderer.php#L49","closed_by":{"login":"akrabat","id":33135,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzMTM1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/33135?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/akrabat","html_url":"https://github.com/akrabat","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akrabat/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akrabat/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akrabat/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akrabat/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akrabat/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akrabat/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akrabat/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akrabat/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akrabat/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/slimphp/Slim/issues/3298/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/slimphp/Slim/issues/3298/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
