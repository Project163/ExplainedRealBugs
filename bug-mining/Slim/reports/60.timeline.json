#1606 changed the way that the Uri's baseUrl was detected in order to fix #1590. However, this change meant that routing of URLs of the form `/foo/index.php/bar/baz` no longer worked.\n\nThis commit reverts #1606 so that routing works again as the stripping off of the script name  when using rewriting could be done at the web server configuration level, or via a route the redirects to the one without the script name in it.\n\nFixes #1639.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/slimphp/Slim/issues/1643/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/slimphp/Slim/issues/1643/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
