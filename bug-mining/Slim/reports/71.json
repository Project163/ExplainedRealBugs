It seems a bit strange to me to stop the processing abruptly at this early point, before reaching a route. Wouldn't it be better to return a null value, and to let the routes - or middleware - decide what to do no valid data is passed to them?\r\n\r\nMay be related to issue #1807.","closed_by":{"login":"codeguy","id":31677,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxNjc3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/31677?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codeguy","html_url":"https://github.com/codeguy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codeguy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codeguy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codeguy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codeguy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codeguy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codeguy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codeguy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codeguy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codeguy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/slimphp/Slim/issues/2106/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/slimphp/Slim/issues/2106/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
