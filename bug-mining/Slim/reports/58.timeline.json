PR handles route group patterns and slashes between them in a better manner. See issue #1577\n\nWhen processing route groups, ensure that each group pattern is separated by a slash. However also ensure that there is never a double slash between groups and also that we never end up with an empty\npattern.\n\n**Note**\nThis also means that a route with a trailing slash is different from a route without one. If we want `/foo` and `/foo/` to route to the same place, then I can update, or the route can be defined as:\n\n``` php\n$app->get('/foo[/]', function($request, $response, $args){/*...*/});\n```\n\nI have also significantly updated the [tests](https://github.com/akrabat/Slim/blob/better-handling-of-slash-in-routegroup-patterns/tests/AppTest.php#L151-L767) to cover all the cases I could think of:\n\nSingle routes:\n\n| Route URI | Final pattern registered with router |\n| --- | --- |\n| `'/foo'` | `/foo` |\n| `'/foo/'` | `/foo/` |\n| `'foo'` | `/foo` |\n| `'/'` | `/` |\n| `''` | `/` |\n\nRoute groups:\n\n| Group 1 | Group 2 (if exists) | Route URI | Final pattern registered with router |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| `'/foo'` |  | `'/bar'` | `/foo/bar` |\n| `'/foo'` |  | `'/bar/'` | `/foo/bar/` |\n| `'/foo'` |  | `'/'` | `/foo/` |\n| `'/foo'` |  | `''` | `/foo` |\n| `'/foo'` | `'/baz'` | `'/'` | `/foo/baz/` |\n| `'/foo'` | `'/baz'` | `''` | `/foo/baz` |\n| `'/foo'` | `'/baz'` | `'/bar'` | `/foo/baz/bar` |\n| `'/foo'` | `'/baz'` | `'/bar/'` | `/foo/baz/bar/` |\n| `'/foo'` | `'/'` | `'/bar'` | `/foo/bar` |\n| `'/foo'` | `'/'` | `'bar'` | `/foo/bar` |\n| `'/foo'` | `''` | `'/bar'` | `/foo/bar` |\n| `'/foo'` | `''` | `'bar'` | `/foo/bar` |\n| `'/'` |  | `'/bar'` | `/bar` |\n| `'/'` |  | `'/bar/'` | `/bar/` |\n| `'/'` |  | `'/'` | `/` |\n| `'/'` |  | `''` | `/` |\n| `'/'` | `'/baz'` | `'/'` | `/baz/` |\n| `'/'` | `'/baz'` | `''` | `/baz` |\n| `'/'` | `'/baz'` | `'/bar'` | `/baz/bar` |\n| `'/'` | `'/baz'` | `'/bar/'` | `/baz/bar/` |\n| `'/'` | `'/'` | `'/bar'` | `/bar` |\n| `'/'` | `'/'` | `'bar'` | `/bar` |\n| `'/'` | `''` | `'/bar'` | `/bar` |\n| `'/'` | `''` | `'bar'` | `/bar` |\n| `''` |  | `'/bar'` | `/bar` |\n| `''` |  | `'/bar/'` | `/bar/`
