 ## What is a mode? [what-is-a-mode]
 
-Technically, an application mode is merely a string of text — like "development" or "production" — that has an associated callback function used to prepare the Slim application appropriately. The application mode may be anything you like: “testing”, “production”, “development”, or even “foo”.

 ## How do I set the Slim application mode? [how-to-set-mode]
 
 ### Use an environment variable
 
-If Slim sees an environment variable named **SLIM_MODE**, it will set the current application mode to that variable’s value. This lets you define the Slim application mode programmatically if calling the application from the command line.

 ## Configure Slim for a specific mode [configure-for-mode]
 
 After you instantiate a Slim application, you may configure the Slim application for a specific mode with the `configureMode()` application instance method. This method accepts two arguments: the first is the name of the target mode, and the second is anything that returns `true` for `is_callable()` that will be immediately invoked if the first argument matches the current application mode.
 
-In this example, assume the current application mode is “production”. Only the callable associated with the “production” mode will be invoked. The callable associated with the “development” mode will be ignored until the application mode is changed to "development".
