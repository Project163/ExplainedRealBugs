 Slim supports flash messaging much like Rails and other larger web frameworks. Flash messaging allows you to define messages that will persist until the next HTTP request but no further. This is helpful to display messages to the user after a given event or error occurs.
 
-As shown below, the Slim application's `flash()` and `flashNow()` instance methods accept two arguments: a key and a message. The key may be whatever you want and defines how the message will be accessed in the View templates. For example, if I invoke the Slim application's `flash('foo', 'The foo message')` instance method with those arguments, I can access that message in the next request’s templates with `flash['foo']`.

 Flash messages are persisted with sessions; sessions are required for flash messages to work. Flash messages are stored in `$_SESSION['flash']`.

     $app->flash('error', 'User email is required');
 
 ## Flash Now
 
-The Slim application's `flashNow()` instance method sets a message that will be available in the current request’s view templates. Messages set with the `flashNow()` application instance method will not be available in the next request. The message in the example below will be available in the variable `flash['info']` in the current request’s view templates.
