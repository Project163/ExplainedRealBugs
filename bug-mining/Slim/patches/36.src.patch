 # HTTP Caching [caching] #
 
-A Slim application provides built-in support for HTTP caching with its `etag()`, `lastModified()`, and `expires()` instance methods. It is best to use _one_ of `etag()` or `lastModified()` — in conjunction with `expires()` — per route; never use _both_ `etag()` and `lastModified()` together in the same route callback.

 The `etag()` and `lastModified()` methods should be invoked in a route callback *before* other code; this allows Slim to check conditional GET requests _before_ processing the route callback's remaining code.
