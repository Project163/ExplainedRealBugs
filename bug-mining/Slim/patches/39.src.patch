 # Middleware Architecture [middleware-architecture] #
 
-Think of a Slim application as the core of an onion. Each layer of the onion is middleware. When you invoke the Slim application's `run()` method, the outer-most middleware layer is invoked first. When ready, that middleware layer is responsible for optionally invoking the next middleware layer that it surrounds. This process steps deeper into the onion — through each middleware layer — until the core Slim application is invoked. This stepped process is possible because each middleware layer, and the Slim application itself, all implement a public `call()` instance method. When you add new middleware to a Slim application, the added middleware will become a new outer layer and surround the previous outer middleware layer (if available) or the Slim application itself.
