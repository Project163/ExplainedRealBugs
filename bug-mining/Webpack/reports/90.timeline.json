Since @raimund-schluessler beat me to it, I'll hijack this issue instead.\r\n\r\nFor me, it reproduces on this line;\r\n\r\n```\r\nimport Dropzone from \"dropzone\"\r\nDropzone.autoDiscover = false;\r\n```\r\n\r\nwhich gets minimized to \r\n\r\n```\r\nhu._withStripped = (!0)(Nl()).autoDiscover = !1;\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe offending code is inside a Vue component, all transpiled with Babel and minimized with Terser. It's contained within a pretty large project, and reproduces only when building a production build after upgrading from Webpack 4 to Webpack 5.3.2 and Terser 5.0.3. A development build runs perfectly.\r\n\r\nWhen breaking down my large project into a smaller sample, it does not reproduce and the same line gets translated to:\r\n\r\n```\r\ns().autoDiscover=!1\r\n```\r\n\r\nwhich of course works. The **_withStripped** seems to be in @raimund-schluessler code as well, so perhaps this is somehow related to finding the bug.\r\n\r\nCould the **_withStripped** part aid somehow in how to build a reproducible sample?
