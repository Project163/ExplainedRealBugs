I will open a pull request with my implementation of this feature shortly.\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\nCurrently, the plugin will add a warning to the build if an environment variable is undefined and no default value was provided. I would like to add an errorLevel config option that allows the user to define the behavior of the plugin when an environment variable is undefined.\r\n\r\n**What is motivation or use case for adding/changing the behavior?**\r\nI would like to add this to prevent builds from completing with invalid environment variables.  This is especially useful during production builds, if an env variable is missing in production it could cause unintended consequences.\r\n\r\n**How should this be implemented in your opinion?**\r\nAdd a config object as a second argument to the plugin. Default the errorLevel value to 'warning' to maintain consistent behavior and backwards compatibility. Use the errorLevel to determine the error description as well as to determine whether to push the error to compilation.warnings or compilation.errors.\r\n\r\n**Are you willing to work on this yourself?**\r\nyes\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"sokra","id":1365881,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNjU4ODE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1365881?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra","html_url":"https://github.com/sokra","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/webpack/webpack/issues/10296/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/webpack/webpack/issues/10296/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
