Please don't delete this template because we'll close your issue -->\r\n<!-- Before creating an issue please make sure you are using the latest version of webpack. -->\r\n\r\n# Bug report\r\n\r\n<!--

contain questions or support requests will be closed. -->\r\n\r\n**What is the current behavior?**\r\nSome libraries depend on an exported module to have `__esModule === true` for understanding the export is an es module.\r\n\r\nHowever, module concatenation doesn't work with this behavior that it doesn't have the __esModule property.\r\n\r\n**If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce.**\r\nsee the repo: https://github.com/Bobgy/webpack-concat-esmodule-bug-reproduction\r\n\r\n<!-- A great way to do this is to provide your configuration via a GitHub repository -->\r\n<!-- The most helpful is a minimal reproduction with instructions on how to reproduce -->\r\n<!-- Repositories with too many files or large `webpack.config.js` files are not suitable

loader, please create an issue on the loader/plugin repository instead -->\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\n\r\nregardless of a module is concatenated or not, it should have `module.exports.__esModule === true`\r\n\r\n<!-- \"It should work\" is not a helpful explanation -->\r\n<!-- Explain exactly how it should behave -->\r\n\r\n**Other relevant information:**\r\nwebpack
