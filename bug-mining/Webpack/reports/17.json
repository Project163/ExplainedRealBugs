Entry \"a\" depends on \"vendor-a\" and entry \"b\" depends on \"vendor-b\", \"vendor-b\" itself also depends on \"vendor-a\". Now if we have such a cacheGroup \"b\" that captures both vendor modules, and one separate cacheGroup \"a\" for \"vendor-a\" specifically, adding higher ``priority`` to the cacheGroup \"a\" will correctly place \"vendor-a\" in the cacheGroup, however entry \"a\" will be still dependant on result of cacheGroup \"b\", i guess, because, it **possibly** can contain \"vendor-a\". See the example: https://github.com/MhMadHamster/webpack-minimal-example-rep\r\n\r\n**If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce.**\r\nclone example rep: https://github.com/MhMadHamster/webpack-minimal-example-rep run ``yarn start`` check that what i described above is true, then you can change configuration for cacheGroup with key \"b\" to this:\r\n```javascript\r\nb: {\r\n  test: /vendor-b/,\r\n  name: \"vendor-b\",\r\n  enforce: true,\r\n},\r\n```\r\nrun ``yarn start`` again, the only thing that will change in the result code is that entry \"a\" is no more depends on \"vendor-b\" as expected, however \"vendor-a\" and \"vendor-b\" generated code stays the same.\r\n<!-- A great way to do this is to provide your configuration via a GitHub repository -->\r\n<!-- The most helpful is a minimal reproduction with instructions on how to reproduce -->\r\n<!-- Repositories with too many files or large `webpack.config.js` files are not suitable -->\r\n<!-- Please only add small code snippets directly into this issue -->\r\n<!-- https://gist.github.com is a good place for longer code snippets -->\r\n<!-- If your issue is caused by a plugin or loader, please create an issue on the loader/plugin repository instead -->\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\nIf chunk moved to the cacheGroup via ``priority`` option, entries which require this chunk should not depend on the other cacheGroups, which could have that chunk unless ``priority``.\r\n\r\n<!-- \"It should work\" is not a helpful explanation -->\r\n<!-- Explain exactly how it should behave -->\r\n\r\n**Other relevant information:**\r\nwebpack version: 4.29.6\r\nNode.js version: 8.11.3\r\nOperating System: Windows 10\r\nAdditional tools:\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"sokra","id":1365881,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNjU4ODE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1365881?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra","html_url":"https://github.com/sokra","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/webpack/webpack/issues/8908/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/webpack/webpack/issues/8908/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
