If it is not, please excuse me in advance.\r\n\r\n**What is the current behavior?**\r\n\r\nWebpack production build creates a file which gives the following error: `Uncaught TypeError: (!0) is not a function`. The development build runs fine. The compiled javascript file contains this part which seems the reason for the error:\r\n```js\r\ns._withStripped=(!0)((function(){const e=//stripped the rest\r\n```\r\n\r\n**If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce.**\r\n\r\nI tried to build a custom Vue app for Nextcloud containing a component with this javascript part\r\n```Vue\r\n<script>\r\nimport { getFilePickerBuilder } from '@nextcloud/dialogs'\r\n\r\nexport default {\r\n\tmethods: {\r\n\t\tasync selectFolder() {\r\n\t\t\tconst folder = await this.$store.dispatch('getAttachmentFolder')\r\n\r\n\t\t\tconst path = await getFilePickerBuilder(t('inventory', 'Select attachment folder'))\r\n\t\t\t\t.addMimeTypeFilter('httpd/unix-directory')\r\n\t\t\t\t.startAt(folder)\r\n\t\t\t\t.allowDirectories(true)\r\n\t\t\t\t.build()\r\n\t\t\t\t.pick()\r\n\r\n\t\t\tthis.$store.dispatch('setAttachmentFolder', { path })\r\n\t\t},\r\n\t},\r\n}\r\n</script>\r\n```\r\nCommenting out the `getFilePickerBuilder` line circumvents the issue, however, it's most certainly not the underlying cause as I use `getFilePickerBuilder` at a different place without issues.\r\n\r\nAs far as I can tell, the build run fine on webpack 4. If it helps, I can upload the complete javascript file which webpack produced.\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\n\r\nThe file should compile to valid javascript, also in production mode.\r\n\r\n**Other relevant information:**\r\nwebpack version:  5.3.2\r\nNode.js version: v10.19.0\r\nOperating System: Ubuntu 20.04\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"sokra","id":1365881,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNjU4ODE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1365881?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra","html_url":"https://github.com/sokra","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/webpack/webpack/issues/11897/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/webpack/webpack/issues/11897/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
