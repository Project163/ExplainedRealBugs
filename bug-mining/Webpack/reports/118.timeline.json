Error semantic is now more correct, so I consider this a bugfix.\r\n<!-- If this PR introduces a breaking change, please describe the impact and a migration path for existing applications. -->\r\n\r\n**What needs to be documented once your changes are merged?**\r\n* deprecated `output.strictModuleExceptionHandling`\r\n* add `output.strictModuleErrorHandling`: Handles module execution error according to the ESM spec at a performance cost.\r\n* Additions to the HMR API:\r\n  * Added optional error handler argument to `accept` with dependency:\r\n    `import.meta.webpackHot.accept(\"./dep\", () => { ... }, (err, { moduleId, dependencyId }) => { ... })`\r\n    * `err` the error thrown by the callback in second argument or during dependency execution when using ESM dependencies\r\n    * `moduleId` the current module id\r\n    * `dependencyId` the module id of the (first) changed dependency. Here module id of `./dep`.\r\n  * Added meta info object to error handler in self `accept`:\r\n    `import.meta.webpackHot.accept((err, { moduleId, module }) => { ... })`\r\n    * `moduleId` the current module id\r\n    * `module` the current module instance\r\n      * `module.hot` allow to use the HMR API of the errored module instance. A common scenario is to self accept it again. It also makes sense to add a dispose handle to pass `data` along.\r\n      * Note that the errored module might be already partially executed, so make sure to not get into a inconsistent state. You can use `module.hot.data` to store partial state.\r\n      * `module.exports` can be overriden, but be careful since property names might be mangled in production mode.\r\n<!-- List all the information that needs to be added to the documentation after merge -->\r\n<!-- When your changes are merged you will be asked to contribute this to the documentation
