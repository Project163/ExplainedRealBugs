For example, using `filter` or `map` or importing from a `.json` file all give you a `string[]`, which cannot be assigned to `[string, ...string[]]` without an unchecked cast, even if the programmer “knows” the result will be nonempty.\r\n\r\n**How should this be implemented in your opinion?**\r\nEither remove the relevant `\"minItems\": 1` from `schemas/WebpackOptions.json`, or configure `json-schema-to-typescript` with `ignoreMinAndMaxItems`.\r\n\r\n**Are you willing to work on this yourself?**\r\nyes\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"sokra","id":1365881,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNjU4ODE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1365881?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra","html_url":"https://github.com/sokra","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/webpack/webpack/issues/11801/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/webpack/webpack/issues/11801/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
