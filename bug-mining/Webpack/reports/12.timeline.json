**modification** request\r\n\r\n### Overview\r\nI'm not sure if this is a webpack or a webpack dev server bug, but it looks like there might be a missing module dependency between async and shared bundles in some edge cases.\r\n\r\nAt @slackhq, we've run into an interesting bug where changing code, and allowing webpack-dev-server to recompile the code, has resulted in code simply disappearing from the updated bundles! \r\n\r\nI've narrowed this down to the relationship between shared bundles and async bundles which webpack / webpack-dev-server eventually creates - if you have a long dependency tree where you reexport modules over and over, webpack updates the import definitions for code in the shared bundle, but not in the async bundle. This means that there is a mismatch in variable names, and so that variable becomes undefined.\r\n\r\n### Code\r\nThe bug has been replicated in this minimal reproducible repo here: https://github.com/AnujRNair/webpack-missing-module-dependency\r\n\r\n### Expected Behavior\r\nBoth the shared bundle and the async bundle should be updated to reflect the latest code changes.\r\n\r\n### Actual Behavior\r\nOnly the shared bundle is updated. The async bundle remains the same.\r\n\r\n### For Bugs; How can we reproduce the behavior?\r\nFollow the instructions in the repo linked above.\r\n\r\n### For Features; What is the motivation and/or use-case for the feature?\r\nN/A","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/webpack/webpack-dev-server/issues/1584/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/webpack/webpack-dev-server/issues/1584/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/webpack/webpack/issues/comments/443823961","html_url":"https://github.com/webpack/webpack/issues/8455#issuecomment-443823961","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/webpack/webpack/issues/8455","id":443823961,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ0MzgyMzk2MQ==","user":{"login":"sokra","id":1365881,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNjU4ODE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1365881?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra","html_url":"https://github.com/sokra","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-12-03T18:49:44Z","updated_at":"2018-12-03T18:49:44Z","body":"Yep, it's a bug.
