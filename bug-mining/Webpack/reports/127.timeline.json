Bug report\r\n\r\nAs written on the title I have the issue of having `__webpack_exports__` that is undefined when loading (later) a second entry point.\r\n\r\nI'm using the latest lib versions `webpack@5.35.0` and `webpack-dev-server@3.11.2` on node `v15.11.0` on Linux.\r\n\r\nI have a very simple config:\r\n\r\n```js\r\n    entry: {\r\n      index: {\r\n        import: [paths.appIndexJs, ...((isEnvDevelopment && !shouldUseReactRefresh && [webpackDevClientEntry]) || [])],\r\n        runtime: 'runtime'\r\n      },\r\n      app: {\r\n        import: paths.appAppTsx,\r\n        dependOn: 'index'\r\n      }\r\n    },\r\n    output: {\r\n      filename: '/js/[name].js',\r\n      globalObject: 'window',\r\n      library: {\r\n        // name: 'index',\r\n        type: 'window'\r\n      },\r\n      iife: true\r\n    }\r\n    [...]\r\n```\r\n\r\nMy `runtime` & `index` are injected in the html and loaded first then I append to the document a script element with `app.js` file.\r\nThis one executing and failed on the last `if` since `__webpack_exports__` is undefined\r\n(By the way I don't really know why id does not crash on the `for` but whatever)\r\n```js\r\n/******/ function(__webpack_require__) { // webpackRuntimeModules\r\n/******/ \"use strict\";\r\n/******/ \r\n/******/ var __webpack_exec__ = function(moduleId) { return __webpack_require__(__webpack_require__.s = moduleId); }\r\n/******/ __webpack_require__.O(0, [\"vendors-node_modules_ant-design_icons_es_components_Icon_js-node_modules_ant-design_icons_es_-64c2f1\",\"vendors-node_modules_css-loader_dist_runtime_api_js-node_modules_css-loader_dist_runtime_cssW-2d1059\",\"index\"], function() { return __webpack_exec__(\"./src/App.tsx\"), __webpack_exec__(\"./node_modules/webpack/hot/dev-server.js\"); });\r\n/******/ var __webpack_exports__ = __webpack_require__.O();\r\n/******/ var __webpack_export_target__ = window;\r\n/******/ for(var i in __webpack_exports__) __webpack_export_target__[i] = __webpack_exports__[i];\r\n/******/ if(__webpack_exports__.__esModule) Object.defineProperty(__webpack_export_target__, \"__esModule\", { value: true });\r\n/******/ }\r\n```\r\n\r\nI don't have a reproduction case for you but my `index.js` is relatively simple and my `app.js` is bundling the rest of the app (a react app).\r\nBasically what we are doing is loading the app only if we support the browser and if not redirect the user to a warning/faq/tuto page.\r\n```js\r\nvar userAgent = window.navigator.userAgent\r\n\r\nif (\r\n  userAgent.indexOf('MSIE ') >= 0\r\n  || userAgent.indexOf('Trident/') >= 0\r\n  || userAgent.indexOf('Edge/') >= 0\r\n) {\r\n  window.location.href = '/non-supported-browser.html'\r\n} else {\r\n  window._startLoading() // Just styling & animation\r\n  var script = document.createElement('script')\r\n  script.src = '/js/app.js'\r\n  script.defer = true\r\n  document.head.appendChild(script)\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nI did multiple try and not found yet a proper way to solve this issue so I really hope you can give me some help
