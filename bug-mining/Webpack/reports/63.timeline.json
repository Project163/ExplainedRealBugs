This means major changes and features are done. Major breaking changes have been added. Basic backward-compatibility has been added.\r\n\r\nWe want to use the beta phase to do the following:\r\n\r\n* Let a boarder range of users test the beta version.\r\n* Find bugs in new features.\r\n* Find regressions in old features.\r\n* Find places where a compat-layer can be added to avoid breaking changes.\r\n* Improve the [migration guide](https://github.com/webpack/changelog-v5/blob/master/MIGRATION%20GUIDE.md) and [changelog](https://github.com/webpack/changelog-v5/blob/master/README.md).\r\n\r\nWe want to reach these goals after the beta phase:\r\n\r\n* Old features are very stable\r\n* New features are a bit stable\r\n* Backward-compatibility layer allows most existing plugins/loader to work unmodified (potentially with deprecation warnings)\r\n* There clear way how to migrate from webpack 4 to 5\r\n* There are experimental webpack 5 branches for higher-level tools (like angular-cli, vue-cli, create-react-app, ...) (at least 2)\r\n\r\nTo help with testing you can do the following:\r\n\r\n* Always test with the latest webpack beta version, as problems might already be fixed there\r\n* When using webpack directly:\r\n  * Follow the [migration guide](https://github.com/webpack/changelog-v5/blob/master/MIGRATION%20GUIDE.md)\r\n  * Report or add missing steps in the migration guide\r\n  * Report problems during the migration\r\n  * Report problems with the build after the migration\r\n* When using a higher-level tool:\r\n  * Check if there is a branch/Pull Request for webpack 5\r\n  * Follow guide there\r\n  * Report problems in the Pull Request\r\n* Make sure to also report (positive) experience\r\n  * Performance comparison\r\n  * Size comparison\r\n  * DX comparison\r\n* Try new features\r\n  * Enable persistent caching -> [guide](https://github.com/webpack/changelog-v5/blob/master/guides/persistent-caching.md)\r\n  * Enable Top Level Await\r\n  * Enable the new `asset` module type\r\n  * Enable Long Term Caching\r\n  * Try to break filesystem watching\r\n* Trace back deprecation warnings with `node --trace-deprecation`\r\n  * Help upgrading plugins/loaders\r\n* Make sure to follow beta releases\r\n  * Retest newer version to avoid regressions in beta versions\r\n* Consider sponsoring webpack when this version\r\n  * increases your productivity with better build performance\r\n  * increases your productivity with better developer experience\r\n  * increases your consumer happiness with better application performance\r\n  * make you happy in some other way...\r\n\r\nKnown problems:\r\n\r\n* `eval()` causes problems with the `optimization.innerGraph` (production).\r\n* `libraryTarget: \"module\"` is not implemented yet\r\n* `devtool`s don't support persistent caching yet\r\n* Persistent Cache file include absolute paths are are not portable yet\r\n* `import.meta` is still missing\r\n* prefetching doesn't work for WASM yet\r\n* CLI arguments doesn't contribute to cache version\r\n* ~[stack trace is incorrectly displayed in stats](https://github.com/webpack/webpack/issues/9802#issuecomment-541209889)~\r\n* Build Time is a bit higher for non-cached builds. Possible reasons:\r\n  * tracking extra information in the resolver for safe caching\r\n* [mini-css-extract-plugin is not able to persistent cache yet](https://github.com/webpack/webpack/issues/9802#issuecomment-541303173)\r\n* https://github.com/webpack-contrib/stylelint-webpack-plugin/issues/187\r\n* [svg-sprite-loader doesn't work](https://github.com/webpack/webpack/issues/9802#issuecomment-541468003)\r\n* There is no warning for Buffer or process yet.\r\n\r\nPlanned breaking changes:\r\n\r\n* ~devtool options will be more restrictive~\r\n* Internal HMR API for plugins will probably change\r\n* ~Disable some webpack-only syntax by default: `require.ensure`, `require.include`~\r\n* terser-webpack-plugin will be upgraded\r\n* ~cache.store != \"pack\" will be removed~","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/webpack/webpack/issues/9802/reactions","total_count":390,"+1":148,"-1":0,"laugh":15,"hooray":112,"confused":0,"heart":63,"rocket":41,"eyes":11},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/webpack/webpack/issues/9802/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":3507546954,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDM1MDc1NDY5NTQ=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/webpack/webpack/issues/events/3507546954","actor":{"login":"sokra","id":1365881,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNjU4ODE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1365881?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra","html_url":"https://github.com/sokra","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"92d4e40706d3e1226eaeb3e9cdd2810d28fd2577","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/webpack/webpack/commits/92d4e40706d3e1226eaeb3e9cdd2810d28fd2577","created_at":"2020-07-02T15:04:37Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/webpack/webpack/issues/comments/653136502","html_url":"https://github.com/webpack/webpack/issues/10826#issuecomment-653136502","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/webpack/webpack/issues/10826","id":653136502,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY1MzEzNjUwMg==","user":{"login":"sokra","id":1365881,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNjU4ODE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1365881?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra","html_url":"https://github.com/sokra","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-07-02T17:35:26Z","updated_at":"2020-07-02T17:35:26Z","body":"I'll

There's one minor snag: it seems we also need to hook into the `LoadScriptRuntimeModule` compilation hooks (the `createScript` hook specifically.) I can't see a way to get to it though without `require('webpack/lib/runtime/LoadScriptRuntimeModule')`. That file doesn't exist in earlier Webpack versions, which means we would have to make the `require` optional (catch the load error) or conditional (check for Webpack version first), both of which are a bit awkward. Is there another way to get to that hook, and if not, could you add one?\r\n\r\nAlternatively, if there was a new type of hook called for every inserted `script` tag (and other tags that can receive SRI, i.e.`link`) then our code could be both more elegant and more robust as we wouldn't have to worry about implementation details like this one; plus, such a hook could be reused by other plugins that inject tags and other plugins that wish to modify injected tags.

[x] Fixes #171 \r\n\r\nAdds new option `lazyHashes` (name subject to change), which controls new behavior that creates a directed acyclic graph of the chunk graph by reducing cycles to [strongly-connected components](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strongly_connected_component). The DAG is then [topologically sorted](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topological_sorting) such that the integrity hashes are calculated from the leaf nodes up, so the hash of the assets with child integrity hashes are not invalidated.\r\n\r\nI did some minor refactoring in the process, but the only behavioral change for the default configuration was moving the hashes from `__webpack_require__.sriHashes` to `${globalObject}.sriHashes`. In testing, I ran into issues where async chunks could not access `__webpack_require__`.\r\n\r\nI still need to write tests, but the holidays are approaching, and I will be OOF for the last two weeks of the year. I wanted to make sure I got this out for the maintainers to look at before I disappeared for a while.
