Please don't delete this template because we'll close your issue -->\r\n<!-- Before creating an issue please make sure you are using the latest version of webpack. -->\r\n\r\n# Bug report\r\n\r\n<!--

contain questions or support requests will be closed. -->\r\n\r\n**What is the current behavior?**\r\nStarting with 5.25, webpack bundles output as AMDs, in combination with _runtimeChunk_, no longer provides the exports of the main file of the bundle when imported, using for example RequireJS.\r\n\r\n**If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce.**\r\nRepository with minimal code to reproduce:\r\nhttps://github.com/SimmeNilsson/webpack_amd\r\nSteps:\r\n_yarn\r\nyarn build_\r\nRun _index.html_, watch what main.js receives from bundle (undefined).\r\nDowngrade to Webpack 5.24 or older\r\n_yarn add -D webpack@5.24.4_\r\nRun _index.html_ again, watch what main.js receives from bundle (exported object).\r\n\r\n<!-- A great way to do this is to provide your configuration via a GitHub repository -->\r\n<!-- The most helpful is a minimal reproduction with instructions on how to reproduce -->\r\n<!-- Repositories with too many files or large `webpack.config.js` files are not suitable -->\r\n<!-- Please only add small code snippets directly into this issue -->\r\n<!-- https://gist.github.com is a good place for longer code snippets -->\r\n<!-- If your issue is caused by a plugin or loader, please create an issue on the loader/plugin repository instead -->\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\nExported object received in main.js\r\n\r\n<!-- \"It should work\" is not a helpful explanation -->\r\n<!-- Explain exactly how it should behave -->\r\n\r\n**Other relevant information:**\r\nwebpack version:  5.33.2\r\nNode.js version: 15.12\r\nOperating System: Windows 10\r\nAdditional tools: yarn, RequireJS\r\n\r\nHappens when _runtimeChunk_ is set (\"single\").\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"sokra","id":1365881,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNjU4ODE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1365881?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra","html_url":"https://github.com/sokra","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/webpack/webpack/issues/13165/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/webpack/webpack/issues/13165/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
