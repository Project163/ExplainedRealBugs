can cause the property looked up in the generated code to be different than the one in the source code _(it uses `newName`)_ if there's a identifier collision.\r\n\r\n```js\r\n// index.js\r\nimport modA from \"./module-a\";\r\nimport modB from \"./config\";\r\n\r\nconst { testProp = \"defaultValue\" } = modB;\r\n\r\nmodA();\r\nconsole.log(testProp);\r\n```\r\n```js\r\n// module-a.js\r\n\r\n// In the real code, `stats` is read from another Webpack build\r\n// for the client bundle, generated by `@loadable/webpack-plugin`\r\nconst stats = { testProp: 'valueFromSomeFile' };\r\n\r\nconst { testProp } = stats;\r\n\r\nexport default function printModuleAProp() {\r\n  console.log(testProp);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n```js\r\n// config.js\r\nexport default {\r\n  testProp: \"configuredValue\",\r\n};\r\n```\r\n\r\nGenerated code:\r\n\r\n```js\r\n\r\n/******/ (() => { // webpackBootstrap\r\n/******/ \t\"use strict\";\r\nvar __webpack_exports__ = {};\r\n\r\n;// CONCATENATED MODULE: ./src/module-a.js\r\n// In the real code, `stats` is read from another Webpack build\r\n// for the client bundle, generated by `@loadable/webpack-plugin`\r\nconst stats = { testProp: 'valueFromSomeFile' };\r\n\r\nconst { testProp } = stats;\r\n\r\nfunction printModuleAProp() {\r\n  console.log(testProp);\r\n}\r\n\r\n;// CONCATENATED MODULE: ./src/config.js\r\n/* harmony default export */ const config = ({\r\n\ttestProp: \"configuredValue\",\r\n});\r\n\r\n;// CONCATENATED MODULE: ./src/index.js\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nconst { src_testProp = \"defaultValue\" } = config;\r\n\r\nprintModuleAProp();\r\nconsole.log(src_testProp);\r\n\r\n/******/ })()\r\n;\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe incorrect part is this line:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nconst { src_testProp = \"defaultValue\" } = config;\r\n```\r\n\r\n**If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce.**\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/PAkerstrand/webpack-concatenation-bug\r\n\r\n<!-- A great way to do this is to provide your configuration via a GitHub repository -->\r\n<!-- The most helpful is a minimal reproduction with instructions on how to reproduce -->\r\n<!-- Repositories with too many files or large `webpack.config.js` files are not suitable -->\r\n<!-- Please only add small code snippets directly into this issue -->\r\n<!-- https://gist.github.com is a good place for longer code snippets -->\r\n<!-- If your issue is caused by a plugin or loader, please create an issue on the loader/plugin repository instead -->\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\n\r\nThe generated line should be along the lines of \r\n\r\n```js\r\nconst { testProp: src_testProp = \"defaultValue\" } = config;\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe think we've narrowed down the bug to this part in `lib/optimize/ConcatenatedModule.js`:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nfor (const identifier of allIdentifiers) {\r\n\tconst r = identifier.range;\r\n\tconst path = getPathInAst(info.ast, identifier);\r\n\tif (\r\n\t\tpath &&\r\n\t\tpath.length > 1 &&\r\n\t\tpath[1].type === \"Property\" &&\r\n\t\tpath[1].shorthand\r\n\t) {\r\n\t\tsource.insert(r[1], `: ${newName}`);\r\n\t} else {\r\n\t\tsource.replace(r[0], r[1] - 1, newName);\r\n\t}\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor the code in our example, the path taken is the `else`-branch, which replaces the name with a new\r\none, rather than aliasing the variable name\r\n\r\n<!-- \"It should work\" is not a helpful explanation -->\r\n<!-- Explain exactly how it should behave -->\r\n\r\n**Other relevant information:**\r\nwebpack version:
