This results in incorrect code generated.\r\n\r\nNot sure what's best the solution for this. Always running code generation is probably a bad idea because of performance reasons. Always generating the `__webpack_require__.e` and ensuring chunk independent module code would an option. Tracking multiple variants per module is also an idea and may open up more possibilities...","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/webpack/webpack/issues/comments/425821718/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"sokra","id":1365881,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNjU4ODE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1365881?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra","html_url":"https://github.com/sokra","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":1876024277,"node_id":"MDE1Ok1pbGVzdG9uZWRFdmVudDE4NzYwMjQyNzc=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/webpack/webpack/issues/events/1876024277","actor":{"login":"sokra","id":1365881,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNjU4ODE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1365881?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra","html_url":"https://github.com/sokra","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"milestoned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-10-01T08:04:42Z","milestone":{"title":"important

It has minimal code to set up 2 additional bundles for Monaco's web workers and `splitChunks` option to combine code from `node_modules` into separate chunk. Not the smallest code so I provide a link to repository instead of source code excerpts: https://github.com/keaukraine/monaco-webpack-typescript-test\r\nBehavior of this example is inconsistent in `development` and `production` modes.\r\n\r\n**What is the current behavior?**\r\n\r\nIn `development` mode, example builds and works in runtime.\r\nIn `production` mode, it builds successfully but fails in runtime with the following error:\r\n```\r\nTypeError: n.e is not a function\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen `optimization: { minimize: false }` is added to test `webpack.config`, runtime error is:\r\n```\r\nTypeError: __webpack_require__.e is not a function\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis makes me suspect that this issue is related to bug #8110 \r\n\r\n**If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce.**\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Clone sample repository https://github.com/keaukraine/monaco-webpack-typescript-test/\r\n2. run `npm install`\r\n3. run `npm start`\r\n4. In browser, open http://localhost:8080 (or another port shown in console).\r\n5. Example will have working Monaco Editor, no errors in developer console.\r\n6. Stop HTTP server.\r\n5. Change mode to `production`  in `webpack.config.js` file. Optionally, add `optimization: { minimize: false }` config option.\r\n6. Start server again with `npm start` command.\r\n7. Refresh page at http://localhost:8080. Runtime errors can be observed. \r\n\r\n<!-- A great way to do this is to provide your configuration via a GitHub repository -->\r\n<!-- The most helpful is a minimal reproduction with instructions on how to reproduce -->\r\n<!-- Repositories with too many files or large `webpack.config.js` files are not suitable -->\r\n<!-- Please only add small code snippets directly into this issue -->\r\n<!-- https://gist.github.com is a good place for longer code snippets -->\r\n<!-- If your issue is caused by a plugin or loader, please create an issue on the loader/plugin repository instead -->\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\n\r\nExpected behavior is for this example to run without runtime errors in both `development` and `production` modes.\r\n\r\n<!-- \"It should work\" is not a helpful explanation -->\r\n<!-- Explain exactly how it should behave -->\r\n\r\n**Other relevant information:**\r\nwebpack version:  4.28.4\r\nNode.js version: 10.9.0\r\nOperating System: Windows 10, Git bash.\r\nAdditional tools: None.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/webpack/webpack/issues/8623/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/webpack/webpack/issues/8623/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/webpack/webpack/issues/comments/454644247","html_url":"https://github.com/webpack/webpack/issues/8110#issuecomment-454644247","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/webpack/webpack/issues/8110","id":454644247,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ1NDY0NDI0Nw==","user":{"login":"bitores","id":17512181,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NTEyMTgx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17512181?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bitores","html_url":"https://github.com/bitores","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bitores/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bitores/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bitores/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bitores/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bitores/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bitores/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bitores/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bitores/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bitores/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-01-16T04:02:58Z","updated_at":"2019-01-16T04:02:58Z","body":"**// This file contains only the entry chunk.\r\n// The chunk loading function for additional chunks\r\n __webpack_require__.e = function requireEnsure(chunkId, callback) {...}**","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/webpack/webpack/issues/comments/454644247/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"bitores","id":17512181,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NTEyMTgx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17512181?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bitores","html_url":"https://github.com/bitores","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bitores/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bitores/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bitores/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bitores/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bitores/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bitores/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bitores/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bitores/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bitores/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}}]
