Maybe it also works with that.\r\n\r\nHere are a few hints how to implement it:\r\n\r\nUse the current in-memory caching as base. Since the Cache API does memory caching if persistent caching is disabled, you can replace the current caching with the new one.\r\n\r\nThe cache API is at `compilation.cache`. Important methods are `get` and `store` (lib/Cache.js for the API).\r\n\r\nThe current cache uses the input Source object as key. This won't work for the cache API as object identity break when serialized.\r\n\r\nCreate a cache identifier i. e. from the asset name: `${compilation.compilerPath}/SourceMapDevToolPlugin/${asset.name}`\r\n\r\nCreate a `etag` from the hash of the input Source: `asset.source.updateHash(hash)` `createHash(\"md4\")` `lib/util/createHash.js`.\r\n\r\nCall `compilation.cache.get(cacheIdentifier, etag, ...)`\r\n\r\nCall `compilation.cache.store(cacheIdentifier, etag,
