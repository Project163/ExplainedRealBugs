Bundle `page.js` to `page.bundle.js` with webpack for server side render (I'm setting `target` to `node` and `output.libraryTarget` to `commonjs2`)\r\n2. Call `renderToStaticMarkup`  from `react-dom/server` to render the`page.bundle.js` of step 1 into html\r\n\r\nHowever, the `page.js` contains code like `const logo = new URL('./logo.svg', import.meta.url)`, now when I require the built `page.bundle.js` and render it with `renderToStaticMarkup`, here's the result of that image:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<img src=\"file:///Users/sam/Documents/githubRepos/webpack-web-commonjs/dist/c43188443804f1b1f534.svg\"/>\r\n```\r\nWhich obviously won't work in browser.\r\n\r\n**If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce.**\r\n\r\nHere's a repository I've setup https://github.com/chenxsan/issue-webpack-web-commonjs2, you can see the readme for how to reproduce.\r\n\r\n<!-- A great way to do this is to provide your configuration via a GitHub repository -->\r\n<!-- The most helpful is a minimal reproduction with instructions on how to reproduce -->\r\n<!-- Repositories with too many files or large `webpack.config.js` files are not suitable -->\r\n<!-- Please only add small code snippets directly into this issue -->\r\n<!-- https://gist.github.com is a good place for longer code snippets -->\r\n<!-- If your issue is caused by a plugin or loader, please create an issue on the loader/plugin repository instead -->\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\n\r\n`new URL()` works alongside server side rendering.\r\n\r\n<!-- \"It should work\" is not a helpful explanation -->\r\n<!-- Explain exactly how it should behave -->\r\n\r\n**Other relevant
