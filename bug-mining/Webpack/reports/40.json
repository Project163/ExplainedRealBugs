I'm not sure if it's related or not. It seems to happen with some specific combination of static and dynamic imports between multiple entrypoints.\r\n\r\n**If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce.**\r\n- checkout https://github.com/ArgonAlex/webpack-e-undefined\r\n- run `yarn`\r\n- run `yarn test`\r\n\r\n<!-- A great way to do this is to provide your configuration via a GitHub repository -->\r\n<!-- The most helpful is a minimal reproduction with instructions on how to reproduce -->\r\n<!-- Repositories with too many files or large `webpack.config.js` files are not suitable -->\r\n<!-- Please only add small code snippets directly into this issue -->\r\n<!-- https://gist.github.com is a good place for longer code snippets -->\r\n<!-- If your issue is caused by a plugin or loader, please create an issue on the loader/plugin repository instead -->\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\nI would expect `__webpack_require__.e` to be defined or not referenced. Disabling module concatenation causes it to be defined, but I don't know if that feature is the root cause of the issue.\r\n\r\n<!-- \"It should work\" is not a helpful explanation -->\r\n<!-- Explain exactly how it should behave -->\r\n\r\n**Other relevant information:**\r\nwebpack version:  4.41.2\r\nNode.js version: 12\r\nOperating System: OSX\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"sokra","id":1365881,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNjU4ODE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1365881?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra","html_url":"https://github.com/sokra","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/webpack/webpack/issues/10104/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/webpack/webpack/issues/10104/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
