is not defined`\r\n`Uncaught (in promise) TypeError: c(...).Z is not a function`\r\n\r\nThe compiled code is missing `__webpack_require__`\r\n\r\n**If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce.**\r\n\r\nHere's a very minimal setup that reproduces this bug.\r\n\r\n```js\r\n// webpack.config.js\r\nconst path = require(\"path\");\r\n\r\nmodule.exports = {\r\n  entry: {\r\n    app: \"./src/app.js\",\r\n    home: {\r\n      import: './src/home.js',\r\n      dependOn: 'app' // removing this line fixes it\r\n    }\r\n  },\r\n  output: {\r\n    path: path.resolve(\"./dist\"),\r\n  },\r\n  optimization: {\r\n    runtimeChunk: \"single\",\r\n  },\r\n};\r\n```\r\n\r\n```js\r\n// src/app.js\r\nimport(\"./test.js\");\r\n```\r\n\r\n```js\r\n// src/log.js\r\nexport default function (msg) {\r\n  console.log(msg);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n```js\r\n// src/test.js\r\nimport log from \"./log\";\r\nlog(\"Hi\");\r\n```\r\n\r\n```js\r\n// src/home.js\r\nimport log from \"./log\";\r\nlog(\"Hi\");\r\n```\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<script src=\"runtime.js\"></script>\r\n<script src=\"app.js\"></script>\r\n<script src=\"home.js\"></script>\r\n```\r\n\r\n<!-- A great way to do this is to provide your configuration via a GitHub repository -->\r\n<!-- The most helpful is a minimal reproduction with instructions on how to reproduce -->\r\n<!-- Repositories with too many files or large `webpack.config.js` files are not suitable -->\r\n<!-- Please only add small code snippets directly into this issue -->\r\n<!-- https://gist.github.com is a good place for longer code snippets -->\r\n<!-- If your issue is caused by a plugin or loader, please create an issue on the loader/plugin repository instead -->\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\n\r\nThis error should not happen, it was working without errors on 5.18.0\r\n\r\n<!-- \"It should work\" is not a helpful explanation -->\r\n<!-- Explain exactly how it should behave -->\r\n\r\n**Other relevant information:**\r\nwebpack version:  5.19.0\r\nNode.js version: v15.7.0\r\nOperating System: macOS 11.2\r\nAdditional
