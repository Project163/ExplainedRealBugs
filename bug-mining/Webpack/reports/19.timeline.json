the interest of supplying dependencies and requirement implementations to s.js, so that we can prevent multiple instances of libraries executing in the Shell (one already provided by the bundle and additional fetched by system), we should have a mechanism to support supplying resolved implementations of the dependency urls system is trying to process. This should be done to help improve performance, prevent redundancy, bandwidth usage and sizing optimization.\r\n\r\nI added a pull request to system 0.20 (https://github.com/systemjs/systemjs/pull/1831) that allowed me to provide functions in addition to the standard urls for dependency mapping using the config API.\r\nI was asked to re implement that logic as an extension for system 2.0, using the hooks API.\r\nAfter investigating and making some progress, I see that the network call for the library / asset / artifact has already been made. The capability offers me a chance to work on the already fetched source code before system pareses it.\r\nI believe, this is an unnecessary call and I feel some capability like a `pre-hook` is needed.

Problem\r\nWhen consuming webpack bundles with SystemJS, it is necessary to [dynamically set the webpack public path](https://webpack.js.org/guides/public-path/#on-the-fly), so that webpack code splits know the base url to find other assets from. This cannot be set at build time, since the webpack bundle could be hosted on a variety of domains that aren't known at build time.\r\n\r\nThe `System.resolve()` api is great for giving you the url to use for your webpack public path. However, it is asynchronous when using system.js and import maps, which makes it impossible to set the public path before webpack starts processing its imports and code splits). This means that webpack will attempt to download code splits at the wrong url.\r\n\r\n## Repo that reproduces problem\r\nSee https://github.com/joeldenning/systemjs-webpack-public-path for a repo that clearly shows this problem. Of particular note is the [set-public-path.js](https://github.com/joeldenning/systemjs-webpack-public-path/blob/master/src/set-public-path.js#L5) file.\r\n\r\n## Related\r\nSee \"Use Case 1\" in https://github.com/systemjs/systemjs/issues/1918#issue-423781227. Also see https://github.com/webpack/webpack/issues/8833#issuecomment-467607871 where it was decided that to start out webpack would continue downloading code splits via webpackJsonp instead of using SystemJS module.import().\r\n\r\n ## Workaround\r\nThe url for the webpack public path can be synchronously known/calculated by monkey patching System.resolve and storing the resolved urls in a way you can access them synchronously:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nconst moduleMap = {};\r\n\r\nwindow.getPublicPath = function(name) {\r\n  const path = moduleMap[name];\r\n  if (path) {\r\n    return path.slice(0, path.lastIndexOf(\"/\") + 1);\r\n  } else {\r\n    throw Error(\"Cannot find public path for \" + name);\r\n  }\r\n};\r\n\r\nconst originalResolve = window.System.resolve;\r\n\r\nwindow.System.resolve = function(name) {\r\n  return originalResolve.apply(this, arguments).then(function(resolved) {\r\n    moduleMap[name] = resolved;\r\n    return resolved;\r\n  });\r\n};\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Proposed solutions\r\n**Expose resolved urls via new System API**\r\nCreate a `resolveSync` API that returns null if resolution hasn't happened or completed yet, but returns the string path if it has.\r\n```js\r\nconst fullUrl = System.resolveSync('main')\r\n__webpack_public_path__ = fullUrl.slice(0, fullUrl.lastIndexOf('/') + 1)\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Expose read-only import map synchronously**\r\n```js\r\nconst fullUrl = System.getImportMap().imports.main\r\n__webpack_public_path__ = fullUrl.slice(0, fullUrl.lastIndexOf('/') + 1)\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Implement and use _context.meta.url**\r\nSee [`_context.meta.url`](https://github.com/systemjs/systemjs/blob/master/docs/system-register.md#format-definition). This one would require the most work I think, since (it appears that) SystemJS does not currently provide `_context` in v3.1.6. Also, it would require a change to webpack that would make it possible for a webpack user to access `_context.meta.url` -- right now that's not really possible because webpack doesn't even know that `_context` exists.\r\n\r\n```js\r\nSystem.register([], function(_export, _context) {\r\n  const fullUrl = _context.meta.url\r\n  __webpack_public_path__ = fullUrl.slice(0, fullUrl.lastIndexOf('/') + 1)\r\n})\r\n```","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/systemjs/systemjs/issues/1939/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/systemjs/systemjs/issues/1939/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"actor":{"login":"jolyndenning","id":5524384,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MjQzODQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5524384?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jolyndenning","html_url":"https://github.com/jolyndenning","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jolyndenning/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jolyndenning/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jolyndenning/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jolyndenning/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jolyndenning/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jolyndenning/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jolyndenning/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jolyndenning/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jolyndenning/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-05-13T18:49:38Z","updated_at":"2019-05-13T18:49:38Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/webpack/webpack/issues/9119","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/webpack/webpack","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/webpack/webpack/issues/9119/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/webpack/webpack/issues/9119/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/webpack/webpack/issues/9119/events","html_url":"https://github.com/webpack/webpack/pull/9119","id":443144286,"node_id":"MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0Mjc4MDc5MDg1","number":9119,"title":"Exposing

exporting react component.\r\nThe app resolves the library in runtime - works great with System!\r\n\r\nThe problem is that React library gets duplicated. \r\nI followed the example from [webpack docs](https://v4.webpack.js.org/plugins/split-chunks-plugin/#split-chunks-example-2).\r\nAs you can see, in the 'dist' folder, separate chunk for React is created (when compiling app).\r\n\r\nThis chunk is JSONP webpack chunk.\r\n\r\nCan such chunk be consumed by System.js - can we force Webpack to emit those chunks as System.js

as the basis for a module that is exported to System JS format. The config has been updated to support System JS format. The consumer of the module is not able to access the properties that the module exposes. I have followed the System JS guidelines for Webpack config and Webpack dev server config. When I try to load the module, System.import() seems to load the module's main entry, but I am not able to access any of the module's properties. Is there something else I would need to do? \r\n\r\nConsumer app index.html:\r\n```html\r\n        <script src=\"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/systemjs@6.8.3/dist/system.min.js\"></script>\r\n        <script type=\"systemjs-importmap\">\r\n            {\r\n                \"imports\": {\r\n                    \"wp5-ms\": \"//localhost:3000/static/js/main.chunk.js\"\r\n                }\r\n            }\r\n        </script>\r\n```\r\n\r\nConsumer app TypeScript:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\n    React.useEffect(() => {\r\n        const loadExample = async () => {\r\n            const wp5Example = await global.System.import('wp5-ms');\r\n            console.log('wp5Example', wp5Example);\r\n        };\r\n\r\n        loadExample();\r\n    }, []);\r\n```\r\n\r\nModule main entry file:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nimport \"systemjs-webpack-interop/auto-public-path\";\r\n\r\nconsole.log(\"hi outside\");\r\nconst foo = { foo: \"bar\" };\r\nexport default foo;\r\n```\r\n\r\nConsole

Convert dynamic `import()` into a `__system_context__.import()`\r\n\r\nGiven\r\n```js\r\n// webpack.config.js\r\nmodule.exports = {\r\n  entry: 'entry.js',\r\n  output: {\r\n    libraryTarget: 'system',\r\n  },\r\n  externals: {\r\n    'lodash': 'lodash'\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n```js\r\n// index.js\r\nimport('lodash').then((m) => console.log(m));\r\n```\r\nExpect\r\n```js\r\n// main.js\r\nSystem.register([], function(__WEBPACK_DYNAMIC_EXPORT__, __system_context__) {\r\n...\r\n\r\n/***/ \"lodash\":\r\n/*!********************!*\\\r\n  !*** external \"lodash\" ***!\r\n  \\********************/\r\n/***/ ((module) => {\r\n\r\nmodule.exports = __system_context__.import('lodash');\r\n\r\n/***/ }),\r\n...\r\n```\r\n\r\n**What is motivation or use case for adding/changing the behavior?**\r\nThis is originally mentioned in https://github.com/webpack/webpack/issues/8833. It will improve the performance by lazy loading the required external modules.\r\n\r\n**How should this be implemented in your opinion?**\r\n\r\nFor the first case, I think we should add a new case `system-register` into https://github.com/webpack/webpack/blob/main/lib/WebpackOptionsApply.js#L184. And probably need to copy `ArrayPushCallbackChunkFormatPlugin` and change accordingly.\r\nFor another case, I've done a simple plugin to find all the `importCalls`, the code looks like this\r\n```\r\ncompiler.hooks.normalModuleFactory.tap(pluginName, (factory) => {\r\n          // 3 cases per https://webpack.js.org/api/normalmodulefactory-hooks/#parser\r\n\t['javascript/auto', 'javascript/dynamic', 'javascript/esm'].forEach((type) => {\r\n\t\tfactory.hooks.parser.for(type).tap(pluginName, (parser) => {\r\n\t\t\tparser.hooks.importCall.tap(pluginName, (expression) => {\r\n\t\t\t\t// console.log('importCall =', expression.source.value, arguments.length);\r\n\t\t\t\tthis.importCalls.push(expression.source.value);\r\n\t\t\t});\r\n\t\t});\r\n\t});\r\n});\r\n```\r\nAnd I use this webpack config\r\n```\r\nexternals: [\r\n\tfunction ({ request }, callback) {\r\n\t\tif (isExternal(externals, request)) {\r\n\t\t\tif (myPlugin.importCalls.includes(request)) {\r\n\t\t\t\t// Lazy load external dynamic imports.\r\n\t\t\t\tcallback(null, `promise __system_context__.import(\"${request}\")`);\r\n\t\t\t} else {\r\n\t\t\t\t// Eager load external static imports.\r\n\t\t\t\tcallback(null, `system ${request}`);\r\n\t\t\t}\r\n\t\t} else {\r\n\t\t\tcallback();\r\n\t\t}\r\n\t}\r\n],\r\n```\r\nPlease confirm if my directions are correct.\r\n\r\n**Are you willing to work on this yourself?**\r\nYes.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/webpack/webpack/issues/15623/reactions","total_count":3,"+1":3,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/webpack/webpack/issues/15623/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"reopened"}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
