This means major changes and features are done. Major breaking changes have been added. Basic backward-compatibility has been added.\r\n\r\nWe want to use the beta phase to do the following:\r\n\r\n* Let a boarder range of users test the beta version.\r\n* Find bugs in new features.\r\n* Find regressions in old features.\r\n* Find places where a compat-layer can be added to avoid breaking changes.\r\n* Improve the [migration guide](https://github.com/webpack/changelog-v5/blob/master/MIGRATION%20GUIDE.md) and [changelog](https://github.com/webpack/changelog-v5/blob/master/README.md).\r\n\r\nWe want to reach these goals after the beta phase:\r\n\r\n* Old features are very stable\r\n* New features are a bit stable\r\n* Backward-compatibility layer allows most existing plugins/loader to work unmodified (potentially with deprecation warnings)\r\n* There clear way how to migrate from webpack 4 to 5\r\n* There are experimental webpack 5 branches for higher-level tools (like angular-cli, vue-cli, create-react-app, ...) (at least 2)\r\n\r\nTo help with testing you can do the following:\r\n\r\n* Always test with the latest webpack beta version, as problems might already be fixed there\r\n* When using webpack directly:\r\n  * Follow the [migration guide](https://github.com/webpack/changelog-v5/blob/master/MIGRATION%20GUIDE.md)\r\n  * Report or add missing steps in the migration guide\r\n  * Report problems during the migration\r\n  * Report problems with the build after the migration\r\n* When using a higher-level tool:\r\n  * Check if there is a branch/Pull Request for webpack 5\r\n  * Follow guide there\r\n  * Report problems in the Pull Request\r\n* Make sure to also report (positive) experience\r\n  * Performance comparison\r\n  * Size comparison\r\n  * DX comparison\r\n* Try new features\r\n  * Enable persistent caching -> [guide](https://github.com/webpack/changelog-v5/blob/master/guides/persistent-caching.md)\r\n  * Enable Top Level Await\r\n  * Enable the new `asset` module type\r\n  * Enable Long Term Caching\r\n  * Try to break filesystem watching\r\n* Trace back deprecation warnings with `node --trace-deprecation`\r\n  * Help upgrading plugins/loaders\r\n* Make sure to follow beta releases\r\n  * Retest newer version to avoid regressions in beta versions\r\n* Consider sponsoring webpack when this version\r\n  * increases your productivity with better build performance\r\n  * increases your productivity with better developer experience\r\n  * increases your consumer happiness with better application performance\r\n  * make you happy in some other way...\r\n\r\nKnown problems:\r\n\r\n* `eval()` causes problems with the `optimization.innerGraph` (production).\r\n* `libraryTarget: \"module\"` is not implemented yet\r\n* `devtool`s don't support persistent caching yet\r\n* Persistent Cache file include absolute paths are are not portable yet\r\n* `import.meta` is still missing\r\n* prefetching doesn't work for WASM yet\r\n* CLI arguments doesn't contribute to cache version\r\n* ~[stack trace is incorrectly displayed in stats](https://github.com/webpack/webpack/issues/9802#issuecomment-541209889)~\r\n* Build Time is a bit higher for non-cached builds.
