Please provide enough information so that others can review your pull request. -->\r\n<!-- Explain the **motivation** for making this change. What existing problem does the pull request solve? -->\r\n<!-- Try to link to an open issue for more information. -->\r\n\r\nThis fixes #18438 by allowing module rules to opt-in to alternate asset module handling behavior where they are treated more like JavaScript modules (in the sense that the asset module content is treated as text instead of binary, and any applicable source maps are included just like they would be for JS modules).\r\n\r\nThe motivation behind this change is to allow for loaders such as `sass-loader` to be used to compile source files into _Asset Modules_ (instead of, e.g., chaining with `css-loader` + `style-loader`) while still retaining valuable source map information that such loaders are capable of producing. For example, a project may want to compile SCSS entry points into static CSS files emitted to the public path of the site, with `.css.map` files produced alongside those `.css` files during development.\r\n\r\n<!-- In addition to that please answer these questions: -->\r\n\r\n**What kind of change does this PR introduce?**\r\n\r\nThis adds a new `binary` option to the `generator` options for `asset`, `asset/inline`, and `asset/resource` modules. This option can be specified to override the `this.binary` property on `NormalModule` that is automatically set to `true` for Asset Modules. Overriding an Asset Module to `binary: false` allows source maps that are produced by the loader chain to be included with the output of an asset module just like for JavaScript modules.\r\n\r\n<!-- E.g. a bugfix, feature, refactoring, build related change, etc… -->\r\n\r\n**Did you add tests for your changes?**\r\n\r\nA new `configCases` test was added in `asset-modules/keep-source-maps` to test this new functionality.\r\n\r\n<!-- Note that we won't merge your changes if you don't add tests -->\r\n\r\n**Does this PR introduce a breaking change?**\r\n\r\nThere should be no breaking changes, as the new behavior is explicitly opt-in. If the new option is not supplied to the generator options, the behavior is identical to before.\r\n\r\n<!-- If this PR introduces a breaking change, please describe the impact and a migration path for existing applications. -->\r\n\r\n**What needs to be documented once your changes are merged?**\r\n\r\nThe new `binary` option on `generator` for Asset Modules. I assume that would be [here](https://webpack.js.org/configuration/module/#rulegenerator) at a minimum.\r\n\r\n<!-- List all the information that needs to be added to the documentation after merge -->\r\n<!-- When your changes are merged you will be asked to contribute this to the documentation -->\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/webpack/webpack/issues/18457/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/webpack/webpack/issues/18457/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/webpack/webpack/issues/comments/2148141733","html_url":"https://github.com/webpack/webpack/issues/18438#issuecomment-2148141733","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/webpack/webpack/issues/18438","id":2148141733,"node_id":"IC_kwDOADgiC86ACgql","user":{"login":"ArcanoxDragon","id":816612,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxNjYxMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/816612?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ArcanoxDragon","html_url":"https://github.com/ArcanoxDragon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ArcanoxDragon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ArcanoxDragon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ArcanoxDragon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ArcanoxDragon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ArcanoxDragon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ArcanoxDragon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ArcanoxDragon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ArcanoxDragon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ArcanoxDragon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-06-04T18:22:22Z","updated_at":"2024-06-04T18:22:22Z","body":"> hm, okay, we can allow to setup `binary: boolean` on the module level, so you can make something modules (in your case `asset.*`) as a non-binary, I think it is a better name and cleary here\r\n\r\nI went ahead and pushed a slightly cleaned-up version of my original workaround fix to the PR for now, but I think I like the idea of having an override for `this.binary` on a module rule a bit more.

> I was planning on submitting a PR to sass-loader if this got accepted so that they can include a sourceMapUrl on the result.\r\n> \r\n> I think better allow to setup `sourceMap: boolean | \"from-options\"` (we don't set any custom source maps options and respect your) and also we skip this - https://github.com/webpack-contrib/sass-loader/blob/master/src/index.js#L107, so you can flexible setup source maps options\r\n\r\nActually the main problem that I identified was not an issue with the `sourceMap` option itself, but rather the fact that the custom SCSS importer used by `sass-loader` does not include `sourceMapUrl` in its importer result:\r\nhttps://github.com/webpack-contrib/sass-loader/blob/master/src/utils.js#L694\r\n\r\nThis causes source mappings for imported SCSS files to be completely garbled in the browser because it tries to use the actual contents of the file as the source URL. Adding `sourceMapUrl: canonicalUrl` fixes the issue, but I'm not sure if that's the correct fix as it would result in absolute URLs being returned for imported files.","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/webpack/webpack/issues/comments/2148152595/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"ArcanoxDragon","id":816612,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxNjYxMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/816612?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ArcanoxDragon","html_url":"https://github.com/ArcanoxDragon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ArcanoxDragon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ArcanoxDragon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ArcanoxDragon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ArcanoxDragon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ArcanoxDragon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ArcanoxDragon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ArcanoxDragon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ArcanoxDragon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ArcanoxDragon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":13041331467,"node_id":"REFE_lADOADgiC86KitcPzwAAAAMJUu0L","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/webpack/webpack/issues/events/13041331467","actor":{"login":"ArcanoxDragon","id":816612,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxNjYxMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/816612?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ArcanoxDragon","html_url":"https://github.com/ArcanoxDragon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ArcanoxDragon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ArcanoxDragon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ArcanoxDragon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ArcanoxDragon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ArcanoxDragon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ArcanoxDragon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ArcanoxDragon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ArcanoxDragon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ArcanoxDragon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"bc1674085cf79215577d73a1062be400b7dedb6b","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ArcanoxDragon/webpack/commits/bc1674085cf79215577d73a1062be400b7dedb6b","created_at":"2024-06-04T20:06:27Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/webpack/webpack/issues/comments/2150348504","html_url":"https://github.com/webpack/webpack/issues/18438#issuecomment-2150348504","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/webpack/webpack/issues/18438","id":2150348504,"node_id":"IC_kwDOADgiC86AK7bY","user":{"login":"alexander-akait","id":4567934,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1Njc5MzQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4567934?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexander-akait","html_url":"https://github.com/alexander-akait","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexander-akait/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexander-akait/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexander-akait/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexander-akait/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexander-akait/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexander-akait/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexander-akait/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexander-akait/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexander-akait/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-06-05T15:23:44Z","updated_at":"2024-06-05T15:23:44Z","body":"For
