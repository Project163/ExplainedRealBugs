In certain edge cases the way webpack generates code doesn't allow hoisting function correctly in circular dependencies. In your case you are executing a function of a module before runtime sees the import to that module (before evaluation of the module has started). The ESM spec allows that.\r\n\r\nI guess this code would work in production due to module concatenation, which handles hoisting of function better.\r\n\r\nAs workaround you should be able to switch the order of imports to fix that.\r\n\r\nIn practice this edge case is pretty rare and in all the years since ESM integration in webpack exists it has not be reported before. It's rare because most code like this would break anyway since you would not be able to access any variable of the scope of the shared module, since they are all still in TDZ or undefined.","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/webpack/webpack/issues/comments/627217250/reactions","total_count":3,"+1":3,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"sokra","id":1365881,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNjU4ODE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1365881?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra","html_url":"https://github.com/sokra","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/webpack/webpack/issues/comments/627380868","html_url":"https://github.com/webpack/webpack/issues/10870#issuecomment-627380868","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/webpack/webpack/issues/10870","id":627380868,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYyNzM4MDg2OA==","user":{"login":"bregenspan","id":237410,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzNzQxMA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/237410?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bregenspan","html_url":"https://github.com/bregenspan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bregenspan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bregenspan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bregenspan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bregenspan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bregenspan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bregenspan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bregenspan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bregenspan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bregenspan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-05-12T14:28:19Z","updated_at":"2020-05-12T14:28:19Z","body":"> I guess this code would work in production due to module concatenation, which handles hoisting of function better.\r\n\r\nIn this case there's also a runtime error in production mode (`Uncaught ReferenceError: Cannot access 't' before initialization` under 5.0.0-beta.16, using default `--mode production` behavior with no config file).

they are recognized as \"boundaries\" for HMR to happen in React Fast Refresh world.\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\n\r\nThe dependency should be the exact exports and thus calls to it should work correctly, even after HMR.\r\n\r\nTo be honest, I'm not sure if this is too extreme/specific of an edge case which is hitting the boundaries of Webpack's CJS/ESM module system. It involves re-exports and circular dependencies (both need to be related to an unaccepted dependency for this issue to rise) which, in practice, are both very difficult to deal with properly in CJS.

In this case, the variable is defined by the time it's referenced when running with ES module semantics, but the webpack dev bundle throws a `TypeError`.\r\n\r\nHopefully we'll simplify our import graph, but I have a pretty clear idea how to solve this in Webpack, it would be a somewhat significant change, but hopefully you think my proposal here would be a good solution.\r\n\r\nThe crux of the problem is that\r\n```ts\r\nexport { Chat } from \"./chat.js\";\r\nexport { ChatCompletion, Completions } from \"./completions.js\";\r\n```\r\ngets webpacked into\r\n```js\r\n__webpack_require__.r(__webpack_exports__);\r\n/* harmony export */ __webpack_require__.d(__webpack_exports__, {\r\n/* harmony export */   Chat: () => (/* reexport safe */ _chat_js__WEBPACK_IMPORTED_MODULE_0__.Chat),\r\n/* harmony export */   Completions: () => (/* reexport safe */ _completions_js__WEBPACK_IMPORTED_MODULE_1__.Completions)\r\n/* harmony export */ });\r\n/* harmony import */ var _chat_js__WEBPACK_IMPORTED_MODULE_0__ = __webpack_require__(/*! ./chat.js */ \"./src/chat.ts\");\r\n/* harmony import */ var _completions_js__WEBPACK_IMPORTED_MODULE_1__ = __webpack_require__(/*! ./completions.js */ \"./src/completions.ts\");\r\n```\r\nWhere, unlike when ES Modules are initializing, `_completions_js__WEBPACK_IMPORTED_MODULE_1__` doesn't even reference the module in question until after `\"./chat.js\"` initializes.  But code in `chat.js` circularly tries to read from it, causing a `TypeError`.\r\n\r\nThe solution would be to create empty module objects and get references to them before evaluating imported modules, via a new `__webpack_require__.initModule` or some such function:\r\n```js\r\n__webpack_require__.r(__webpack_exports__);\r\n/* harmony export */ __webpack_require__.d(__webpack_exports__, {\r\n/* harmony export */   Chat: () => (/* reexport safe */ _chat_js__WEBPACK_IMPORTED_MODULE_0__.Chat),\r\n/* harmony export */   Completions: () => (/* reexport safe */ _completions_js__WEBPACK_IMPORTED_MODULE_1__.Completions)\r\n/* harmony export */ });\r\n\r\n// Get references to the empty modules before evaluating imports.\r\n// `_completions_js__WEBPACK_IMPORTED_MODULE_1__` will be empty at first,\r\n// but it will get populated when `chat.js` imports `completions.js`.\r\n\r\n/* harmony import */ var _chat_js__WEBPACK_IMPORTED_MODULE_0__ = __webpack_require__.initModule(/*! ./chat.js */ \"./src/chat.ts\");\r\n/* harmony import */ var _completions_js__WEBPACK_IMPORTED_MODULE_1__ = __webpack_require__.initModule(/*! ./completions.js */ \"./src/completions.ts\");\r\n\r\n// Actually evaluate the imports\r\n/* harmony import */ __webpack_require__(/*! ./chat.js */ \"./src/chat.ts\");\r\n/* harmony import */ __webpack_require__(/*! ./completions.js */ \"./src/completions.ts\");\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhat do you think?  If you're open to this I'd love to work on a PR.","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/webpack/webpack/issues/comments/1703390571/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"jedwards1211","id":1448194,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0NDgxOTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1448194?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedwards1211","html_url":"https://github.com/jedwards1211","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedwards1211/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedwards1211/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedwards1211/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedwards1211/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedwards1211/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedwards1211/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedwards1211/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedwards1211/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedwards1211/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":10261361366,"node_id":"MEE_lADOADgiC84ktvsgzwAAAAJjn_LW","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/webpack/webpack/issues/events/10261361366","actor":{"login":"sokra","id":1365881,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNjU4ODE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1365881?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra","html_url":"https://github.com/sokra","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2023-09-01T22:31:44Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":10261361369,"node_id":"SE_lADOADgiC84ktvsgzwAAAAJjn_LZ","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/webpack/webpack/issues/events/10261361369","actor":{"login":"sokra","id":1365881,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNjU4ODE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1365881?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra","html_url":"https://github.com/sokra","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2023-09-01T22:31:44Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/webpack/webpack/issues/comments/1904495401","html_url":"https://github.com/webpack/webpack/issues/10870#issuecomment-1904495401","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/webpack/webpack/issues/10870","id":1904495401,"node_id":"IC_kwDOADgiC85xhEsp","user":{"login":"alexander-akait","id":4567934,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1Njc5MzQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4567934?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexander-akait","html_url":"https://github.com/alexander-akait","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexander-akait/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexander-akait/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexander-akait/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexander-akait/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexander-akait/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexander-akait/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexander-akait/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexander-akait/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexander-akait/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-01-22T17:40:40Z","updated_at":"2024-01-22T17:40:40Z","body":
