However, the [Wasm/ESM integration proposal](https://github.com/WebAssembly/esm-integration/blob/e098188221887871410616ba1e186740c9d4aa86/proposals/esm-integration/README.md) specifies that a WebAssembly.Global object should be exported instead. (Probably WebAssembly.Global came out after webpack had already implemented its current logic, so the gap wouldn't be surpising.)\r\n\r\n**What is motivation or use case for adding/changing the behavior?**\r\n\r\nCompatibility with native Wasm/ESM interaction and other bundlers that might implement the proposed specification.\r\n\r\n**How should this be implemented in your opinion?**\r\n\r\nNo opinion (I haven't found the code path responsible for the current behavior)\r\n\r\n**Are you willing to work on this yourself?**\r\n\r\nI'm not sure yet; I was planning on focusing on tests first.\r\n\r\nBroader issue: https://github.com/webpack/webpack/issues/8144","closed_by":{"login":"sokra","id":1365881,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNjU4ODE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1365881?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra","html_url":"https://github.com/sokra","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/webpack/webpack/issues/8145/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/webpack/webpack/issues/8145/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
