Maybe that setting doesn't make sense in the context of multiple entry points; in that case, it would be nice if webpack issued some kind of error message to that effect.)\r\n\r\n**If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce.**\r\n\r\nThis repository has a minimal reproduction: https://github.com/rhendric/verbose-octo-telegram\r\n\r\nRun `npm start`, open `http://localhost:8080`, and then make changes to `src/common.js`. They will not appear in the browser. Notice that if you edit the webpack config and remove either the second entry point, or the `name: false` property in `optimization.splitChunks`, HMR will work again.\r\n\r\n<!-- A great way to do this is to provide your configuration via a GitHub repository -->\r\n<!-- The most helpful is a minimal reproduction with instructions on how to reproduce -->\r\n<!-- Repositories with too many files or large `webpack.config.js` files are not suitable -->\r\n<!-- Please only add small code snippets directly into this issue -->\r\n<!-- https://gist.github.com is a good place for longer code snippets -->\r\n<!-- If your issue is caused by a plugin or loader, please create an issue on the loader/plugin repository instead -->\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\n\r\nHMR should work for all project files.
