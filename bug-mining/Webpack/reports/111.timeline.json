#12646, I've used this demo with `sideEffects:false` https://glitch.com/edit/#!/grass-northern-xenon.\r\n\r\nThe original issue was solved, but on the same thread @sokra suggested:\r\n\r\n> btw.\r\n>\r\n> ``` js\r\n>     splitChunks: {\r\n>       chunks: 'all',\r\n>       minSize: 0,\r\n>       usedExports: false\r\n>     }\r\n> ```\r\n> \r\n> will put `utils.js` into it's own chunk\r\n\r\nas a way to force code-splitting between main JS and the worker.\r\n\r\nThis seems to trigger another bug: when I use those settings, the main JS no longer calls `initWorker`, a new thread is not created, and the console on https://grass-northern-xenon.glitch.me/ stays empty.\r\n\r\nIf I comment out e.g. `minSize: 0`, then everything works and `42` is printed in the console as expected.\r\n\r\nNote that this time I don't even use `sideEffects: false`, so the issues are likely not related to each other.\r\n\r\n**Other relevant information:**\r\nwebpack version:

Please don't delete this template because we'll close your issue -->\r\n<!-- Before creating an issue please make sure you are using the latest version of webpack. -->\r\n\r\n# Bug report\r\n\r\n<!--

Issues which contain questions or support requests will be closed. -->\r\n\r\n**What is the current behavior?**\r\n\r\nWhen a web worker imports a CommonJS module with a self reference dependency, webpack throws `Error: Self-reference dependency has unused export name: This should not happen`.\r\n\r\nThis happens when `usedExports` is set to `\"global\"`.\r\n\r\nI think this is related:\r\nhttps://github.com/webpack/webpack/issues/12646 / https://github.com/webpack/webpack/pull/12648\r\n\r\nIt seems like that fix works when `usedExports` is not set to `\"global\"`, but it doesn't work when `usedExports: \"global\"` is set.\r\n\r\n**If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce.**\r\n\r\nRepro: https://github.com/pgoldberg/webpack-self-reference-dependency-worker-bug\r\n\r\n<!-- A great way to do this is to provide your configuration via a GitHub repository -->\r\n<!-- The most helpful is a minimal reproduction with instructions on how to reproduce -->\r\n<!-- Repositories with too many files or large `webpack.config.js` files are not suitable -->\r\n<!-- Please only add small code snippets directly into this issue -->\r\n<!-- https://gist.github.com is a good place for longer code snippets -->\r\n<!-- If your issue is caused by a plugin or loader, please create an issue on the loader/plugin repository instead -->\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\n\r\nWebpack should not throw an error\r\n\r\n**Other relevant information:**\r\nwebpack version:  5.91.0\r\nNode.js version: any\r\nOperating System: any\r\nAdditional tools:\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/webpack/webpack/issues/18315/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/webpack/webpack/issues/18315/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"reopened"}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
