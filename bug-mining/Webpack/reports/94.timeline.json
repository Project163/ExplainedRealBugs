The production build works with [optimization.concatenateModules](https://webpack.js.org/configuration/optimization/#optimizationconcatenatemodules) set to false in the webpack config, but that breaks some of the app pages in runtime and removes default optimization which is bad.\r\n<!-- A clear and concise description of what the bug is. -->\r\n\r\n\r\n__Steps to Reproduce__\r\n\r\nCreate React + webpack project with the webpack.config.js config and run `webpack --mode=production --progress --color --config webpack.config.js`\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nIf you report a modeling related issue, ensure you can reproduce it on [demo.bpmn.io](https://demo.bpmn.io/new)\r\n\r\nWhen reporting a library error, try to build an example that reproduces your problem.
