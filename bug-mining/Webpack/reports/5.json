(although does specify the error in it's return value)\r\n\r\nThis is my configuration: \r\n\r\n```js\r\n\r\nconst webpack = require(\"webpack\");\r\nconst asyncWebpack = promisify(webpack);\r\n\r\n// ...\r\n\r\n// the following code is in a try / catch block\r\n\r\nconst result = await asyncWebpack({\r\n  target: \"node\",\r\n  entry: join(process.cwd(), normalize(folder), index),\r\n  mode: \"production\",\r\n  output: {\r\n    library: name,\r\n    libraryTarget: \"umd\",\r\n    filename: join(name, index)\r\n  },\r\n  plugins: [new webpack.IgnorePlugin(/^hiredis*/)],\r\n  externals: [\"aws-sdk\"]\r\n});\r\n\r\n// result contains error information!\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n<!-- A great way to do this is to provide your configuration via a GitHub repository -->\r\n<!-- The most helpful is a minimal reproduction with instructions on how to reproduce -->\r\n<!-- Repositories with too many files or large `webpack.config.js` files are not suitable -->\r\n<!-- Please only add small code snippets directly into this issue -->\r\n<!-- https://gist.github.com is a good place for longer code snippets -->\r\n<!-- If your issue is caused by a plugin or loader, please create an issue on the loader/plugin repository instead -->\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\n\r\nWebpack should throw an error upon compilation issues.\r\n\r\n<!-- \"It should work\" is not a helpful explanation -->\r\n<!-- Explain exactly how it should behave -->\r\n\r\n**Other relevant information:**\r\n\r\nwebpack version:  ^4.17.2\r\nNode.js version: v11.0.0\r\nOperating System: macOS Mojave\r\nAdditional tools: -\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"sokra","id":1365881,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNjU4ODE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1365881?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra","html_url":"https://github.com/sokra","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/webpack/webpack/issues/8298/reactions","total_count":3,"+1":3,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/webpack/webpack/issues/8298/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
