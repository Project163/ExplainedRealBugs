Maybe this makes it somehow expected behaviour, but it seems odd that Worker code is still correctly included (after all, the only purpose of Workers is to perform side-effects), it's just the import that doesn't resolve.\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\n\r\nThe import in `Worker` should resolve to actual function `foo`.\r\n\r\n**Other relevant information:**\r\nwebpack version: 5.21.2","closed_by":{"login":"sokra","id":1365881,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNjU4ODE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1365881?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra","html_url":"https://github.com/sokra","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/webpack/webpack/issues/12646/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/webpack/webpack/issues/12646/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
