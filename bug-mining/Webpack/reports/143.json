SWC/esbuild transform complex constructor expressions one way, and Babel does it another way. Webpack 5 currently only correctly handles the form that Babel produces.\r\n\r\nMore details are described in the reproduction repo linked below.\r\n\r\n**What is the current behavior?**\r\n\r\nGiven the following input:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nconst a = new (require('url').URL)('file:' + __filename).href\r\nconst b = new (require('url')).URL('file:' + __filename).href\r\nconsole.log(a, b);\r\n```\r\n\r\nwebpack produces the following\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nvar __filename = \"/index.js\";\r\nconst a = new (__webpack_require__(/*! url */ \"url\").URL)('file:' + __filename).href\r\nconst b = new __webpack_require__(/*! url */ \"url\").URL('file:' + __filename).href\r\nconsole.log(a, b);\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis code is _not_ equivalent to the source input. Running the above will produce a runtime error\r\n\r\n> TypeError: Class constructor URL cannot be invoked without 'new'\r\n\r\n**If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce.**\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/kherock/webpack-parentheses-bug\r\n\r\nI've provided several scripts to help demonstrate the issue:\r\n\r\n```console\r\n$ yarn build-webpack\r\n$ yarn build-babel\r\n$ yarn build-esbuild\r\n$ yarn build-swc\r\n```\r\n\r\nAdditionally, a JS loader can be enabled in `webpack.config.js` by uncommenting the loader config and swapping\r\n`(babel|esbuild|swc)-loader` to see their effect on webpack output.\r\n\r\n<!-- A great way to do this is to provide your configuration via a GitHub repository -->\r\n<!-- The most helpful is a minimal reproduction with instructions on how to reproduce -->\r\n<!-- Repositories with too many files or large `webpack.config.js` files are not suitable -->\r\n<!-- Please only add small code snippets directly into this issue -->\r\n<!-- https://gist.github.com is a good place for longer code snippets -->\r\n<!-- If your issue is caused by a plugin or loader, please create an issue on the loader/plugin repository instead -->\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\n\r\nThe generated code for `b` should should have parentheses around its `__webpack_require` expression.\r\n\r\n<!-- \"It should work\" is not a helpful explanation -->\r\n<!-- Explain exactly how it should behave -->\r\n\r\n**Other relevant information:**\r\nwebpack version:  v5.61.0\r\nNode.js version: v16.9.1\r\nOperating System: macOS 11.5.2\r\nAdditional tools:\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"sokra","id":1365881,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNjU4ODE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1365881?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra","html_url":"https://github.com/sokra","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/webpack/webpack/issues/14610/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/webpack/webpack/issues/14610/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
