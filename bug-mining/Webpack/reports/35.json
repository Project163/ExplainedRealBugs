Please don't delete this template because we'll close your issue -->\r\n<!-- Before creating an issue please make sure you are using the latest version of webpack. -->\r\n\r\n# Bug report\r\n\r\n<!-- Please ask questions on StackOverflow or the webpack Gitter. -->\r\n<!-- https://stackoverflow.com/questions/ask?tags=webpack -->\r\n<!-- https://gitter.im/webpack/webpack -->\r\n<!-- Issues which contain questions or support requests will be closed. -->\r\n\r\n**What is the current behavior?**\r\n\r\n`createElement.apply(undefined, [\"span\"])` is transformed to `Object(o.createElement.apply)(void 0,[\"span\"])` with `mode: \"production\"`.\r\nThis throws `Uncaught TypeError: Function.prototype.apply was called on undefined, which is a undefined and not a function`\r\n\r\n**If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce.**\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/PutziSan/webpack-5-error-demo\r\n\r\n<!-- A great way to do this is to provide your configuration via a GitHub repository -->\r\n<!-- The most helpful is a minimal reproduction with instructions on how to reproduce -->\r\n<!-- Repositories with too many files or large `webpack.config.js` files are not suitable -->\r\n<!-- Please only add small code snippets directly into this issue -->\r\n<!-- https://gist.github.com is a good place for longer code snippets -->\r\n<!-- If your issue is caused by a plugin or loader, please create an issue on the loader/plugin repository instead -->\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\n\r\nDo not wrap `createElement.apply(undefined, [\"span\"])` with `Object()`\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- \"It should work\" is not a helpful explanation -->\r\n<!-- Explain exactly how it should behave -->\r\n\r\n**Other relevant information:**\r\nwebpack version:  5.0.0-aplha.18\r\n\r\nThe Problem is in [ConcatenatedModule.js](https://github.com/webpack/webpack/blob/next/lib/optimize/ConcatenatedModule.js#L245). \r\n\r\nWith this config\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nmodule.exports = {\r\n  mode: \"production\",\r\n  optimization: {\r\n    concatenateModules: false\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nthe error disappears.","closed_by":{"login":"sokra","id":1365881,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNjU4ODE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1365881?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra","html_url":"https://github.com/sokra","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/webpack/webpack/issues/9500/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/webpack/webpack/issues/9500/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
