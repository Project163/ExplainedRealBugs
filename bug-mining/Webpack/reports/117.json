When the webpack config  is an array, then the `modifiedFiles` is `undefined` when the plugins tap callback is called after a file change.\r\n\r\n**If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce.**\r\nsee the minimal reproduction repo: https://github.com/mbehzad/webpack-modified-files-issue\r\ni.e. \r\n```javascript\r\n// webpack.config.js\r\n\r\nclass SomePlugin {\r\n  apply(compiler) {\r\n    compiler.hooks.emit.tap(\"SomePlugin\", (compilation) => {\r\n        // is always `undefined`\r\n        console.log(compiler.modifiedFiles);\r\n    });\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\nmodule.exports = [\r\n  {\r\n    entry: {\r\n      A: \"./main.js\",\r\n    },\r\n    mode: \"development\",\r\n    plugins: [new SomePlugin()],\r\n  },\r\n  {\r\n    entry: {\r\n      B: \"./main.js\",\r\n    },\r\n    mode: \"development\",\r\n  },\r\n];\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n<!-- A great way to do this is to provide your configuration via a GitHub repository -->\r\n<!-- The most helpful is a minimal reproduction with instructions on how to reproduce -->\r\n<!-- Repositories with too many files or large `webpack.config.js` files are not suitable -->\r\n<!-- Please only add small code snippets directly into this issue -->\r\n<!-- https://gist.github.com is a good place for longer code snippets -->\r\n<!-- If your issue is caused by a plugin or loader, please create an issue on the loader/plugin repository instead -->\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\nI would assume the `modifiedFiles` property has the list of changed files regardless of plugin being part of a multi webpack config or a single one.\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- \"It should work\" is not a helpful explanation -->\r\n<!-- Explain exactly how it should behave -->\r\n\r\n**Other relevant information:**\r\nwebpack version:  5.24.0\r\nwebpack-cli: 4.5.0\r\nNode.js version: 14.15.0\r\nOperating System: Windows 10\r\n\r\n(**might** be relevant information) There were some changes in PR #12671 namely in [Watching.js:91](https://github.com/webpack/webpack/blob/472385eb9e0415b1fd7c0a442be3fb23694a4b6c/lib/Watching.js#L91): \r\n`this.compiler.modifiedFiles = watcher.aggregatedChanges;`\r\nbut the `watcher` is the returned object from NodeWatchFileSystem.js's watch method ([NodeWatchFileSystem.js:89](https://github.com/webpack/webpack/blob/472385eb9e0415b1fd7c0a442be3fb23694a4b6c/lib/node/NodeWatchFileSystem.js#L89)) not the reference to the `watchpack`'s watcher instance. maybe that leads to changes being always undefined?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"sokra","id":1365881,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNjU4ODE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1365881?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra","html_url":"https://github.com/sokra","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/webpack/webpack/issues/12770/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/webpack/webpack/issues/12770/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
