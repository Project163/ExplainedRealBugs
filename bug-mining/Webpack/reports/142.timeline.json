Please provide enough information so that others can review your pull request. -->\r\n<!-- Explain the **motivation** for making this change. What existing problem does the pull request solve? -->\r\n<!-- Try to link to an open issue for more information. -->\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes #14379. \r\n\r\nThere was a mistake in the module build cycle detection logic that made it incorrectly report a `BuildCycleError` when `LoaderContext.loadModule()` is used more than once for the same module (in certain situations).\r\n\r\nInstead of tracking that a child module was being built by a parent, the `Compilation` was (mistakenly) always tracking that the parent was building itself. And modules were never unmarked on completion of their build. This had two notable effects:\r\n\r\n1. Build cycles *were* prevented, because when an attempt was made to build a module twice, it was already marked as being built by itself, so a BuildCycleError was (correctly) reported.\r\n2. Modules could not be requested twice (in a non-cyclic/valid way) via `LoaderContext.loadModule()`, due to 1.\r\n\r\nAlthough point 2 has the caveat that modules are only affected if their loaders call `loadModule()`, and most modules don't, making this a somewhat rare occurrence.\r\n\r\n<!-- In addition to that please answer these questions: -->\r\n\r\n**What kind of change does this PR introduce?**\r\n\r\nBugfix.\r\n\r\n<!-- E.g. a bugfix, feature, refactoring, build related change, etc… -->\r\n\r\n**Did you add tests for your changes?**\r\n\r\nYep. (The second commit adds a test which reproduces the issue and therefore fails. The commit after fixes the issue so the test passes.)\r\n\r\nI wasn't able to run the whole test suite locally, but the `load-module-cycle` tests all passed.\r\n\r\n<!-- Note that we won't merge your changes if you don't add tests -->\r\n\r\n**Does this PR introduce a breaking change?**\r\n\r\n<!-- If this PR introduces a breaking change, please describe the impact and a migration path for existing applications. -->\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n**What needs to be documented once your changes are merged?**\r\n\r\n<!-- List all the information that needs to be added to the documentation after merge -->\r\n<!-- When your changes are merged you will be asked to contribute this to the documentation -->\r\nI don't think anything needs documenting (other than the changelog), as this just brings webpack's behaviour in line with intended behaviour.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/webpack/webpack/issues/14512/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/webpack/webpack/issues/14512/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/webpack/webpack/issues/comments/946140895","html_url":"https://github.com/webpack/webpack/issues/14379#issuecomment-946140895","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/webpack/webpack/issues/14379","id":946140895,"node_id":"IC_kwDOADgiC844ZPbf","user":{"login":"h4l","id":146503,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0NjUwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/146503?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/h4l","html_url":"https://github.com/h4l","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/h4l/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/h4l/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/h4l/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/h4l/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/h4l/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/h4l/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/h4l/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/h4l/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/h4l/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-10-18T20:30:01Z","updated_at":"2021-10-18T20:30:01Z","body":"I also encountered `BuildCycleError` being incorrectly reported when porting a Webpack 4.x build to 5.x.
