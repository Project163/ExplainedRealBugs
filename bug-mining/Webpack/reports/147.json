Unable to find required version for \"my-pkg\" in description file (.../packages/my-pkg/package.json). It need to be in dependencies, devDependencies or peerDependencies.\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd according to the warning, I added the package itself as a dependency, the warning disappears:\r\n\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n  \"name\": \"my-pkg\",\r\n  \"type\": \"module\",\r\n  \"exports\": {\r\n    \"./module-a\": \"./module-a.js\",\r\n    \"./module-b\": \"./module-b.js\"\r\n  },\r\n  \"dependencies\": {\r\n    \"my-pkg\": \"*\" // It's weird to do this...\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n**If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce.**\r\n\r\nIt's a bit complex in my real repo, I can provide a minimal repro if you require, when I got time.\r\n\r\n<!-- A great way to do this is to provide your configuration via a GitHub repository -->\r\n<!-- The most helpful is a minimal reproduction with instructions on how to reproduce -->\r\n<!-- Repositories with too many files or large `webpack.config.js` files are not suitable -->\r\n<!-- Please only add small code snippets directly into this issue -->\r\n<!-- https://gist.github.com is a good place for longer code snippets -->\r\n<!-- If your issue is caused by a plugin or loader, please create an issue on the loader/plugin repository instead -->\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\n\r\nNo warnings. It should use the description file (`my-pkg/package.json`) itself to determine the required version, since it's a self referencing.\r\n\r\n<!-- \"It should work\" is not a helpful explanation -->\r\n<!-- Explain exactly how it should behave -->\r\n\r\n**Other relevant information:**\r\nwebpack version:  5.75.0\r\nNode.js version: 16.15.0\r\nOperating System: MacOS\r\nAdditional tools:\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"TheLarkInn","id":3408176,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MDgxNzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3408176?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/TheLarkInn","html_url":"https://github.com/TheLarkInn","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TheLarkInn/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TheLarkInn/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TheLarkInn/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TheLarkInn/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TheLarkInn/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TheLarkInn/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TheLarkInn/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TheLarkInn/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TheLarkInn/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/webpack/webpack/issues/16683/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/webpack/webpack/issues/16683/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
