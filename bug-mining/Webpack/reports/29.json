So, when the once disposed module is required again, the module is considered [already present and unaccepted](https://github.com/webpack/webpack/blob/master/lib/HotModuleReplacement.runtime.js#L303). And so the hot update is rejected.\r\n\r\nI've tried a patch that prevents a module from being required again just after being disposed, and it does fixes the issue for me. All tests still passing.
