If I use external of type `window`, both are connected correctly with a `external_lodash_namespaceObject` variable. The only difference between `window` and `this` type seems to be that `this` is wrapped in an IIFE. That apparently breaks things.\r\n2. the bundle is in strict mode (because the `allStrict` condition holds, i.e., all modules have `m.buildInfo.strict === true`)\r\n and `this` is therefore `undefined`, not the global this. That breaks any attempt to use `externalType: 'this'`. Maybe `ExternalModule` of type `this` should have `buildInfo.strict === false`?\r\n\r\nDisabling `concatenateModules: false` fixes issue no.1, but issue no.2 is still there.\r\n\r\nIn webpack 4 this used to work because:\r\n- there was no bundle-global `use strict`\r\n- external modules bailed out of module concatenation with the \"Module is not an ECMAScript module\" reason\r\n\r\n**If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce.**\r\nA repo with the above example: https://github.com/jsnajdr/webpack-externals-concat-bug\r\n\r\nJust `npm install` and then run webpack.\r\n\r\n**Other relevant information:**\r\nwebpack version:  5.1.3\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"sokra","id":1365881,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNjU4ODE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1365881?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra","html_url":"https://github.com/sokra","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/webpack/webpack/issues/11724/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/webpack/webpack/issues/11724/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
