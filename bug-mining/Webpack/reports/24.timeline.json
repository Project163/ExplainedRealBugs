'@myorg/package'`","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/webpack/webpack/issues/comments/477051704/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"alexander-akait","id":4567934,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1Njc5MzQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4567934?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexander-akait","html_url":"https://github.com/alexander-akait","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexander-akait/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexander-akait/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexander-akait/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexander-akait/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexander-akait/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexander-akait/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexander-akait/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexander-akait/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexander-akait/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":2232376188,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MjIzMjM3NjE4OA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/webpack/webpack/issues/events/2232376188","actor":{"login":"Airkro","id":12206891,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMjA2ODkx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12206891?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Airkro","html_url":"https://github.com/Airkro","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Airkro/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Airkro/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Airkro/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Airkro/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Airkro/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Airkro/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Airkro/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Airkro/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Airkro/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-03-27T09:11:21Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2232376189,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDIyMzIzNzYxODk=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/webpack/webpack/issues/events/2232376189","actor":{"login":"Airkro","id":12206891,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMjA2ODkx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12206891?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Airkro","html_url":"https://github.com/Airkro","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Airkro/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Airkro/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Airkro/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Airkro/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Airkro/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Airkro/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Airkro/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Airkro/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Airkro/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-03-27T09:11:21Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/webpack/webpack/issues/comments/477051965","html_url":"https://github.com/webpack/webpack/issues/8968#issuecomment-477051965","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/webpack/webpack/issues/8968","id":477051965,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ3NzA1MTk2NQ==","user":{"login":"alexander-akait","id":4567934,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1Njc5MzQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4567934?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexander-akait","html_url":"https://github.com/alexander-akait","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexander-akait/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexander-akait/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexander-akait/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexander-akait/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexander-akait/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexander-akait/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexander-akait/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexander-akait/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexander-akait/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"pub
