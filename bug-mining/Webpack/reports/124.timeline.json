public/exposed, so we already had access to this type anyway and needed it when dealing with `assets`:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nconst fn = (asset: StatsAsset) => { ... };\r\n\r\nstats.assets.map(fn);\r\n```\r\n\r\nOne suggestion I had to reduce the surface we expose was to introduce a subset of the interface like so:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\ninterface ExposedStatsAsset {\r\n  type: string;\r\n  name: string;\r\n  size: number;\r\n  chunkNames?: Array<string|number>;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, this would mean introducing a \"fake\" type for the sole purpose of being exported, which feels worse than just exposing the type itself.\r\n\r\nIMO there's nothing wrong with exposing it as even if you consider it fairly internal, any changes must happen in a new version anyway so it could be an acceptable risk for those of us consuming it.\r\n\r\nThis will also allow us to fix bundlephobia's webpack 5 integration.\r\n\r\nIf you'd rather me tackle this another way, just let me know and i will update.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/webpack/webpack/issues/13016/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/webpack/webpack/issues/13016/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":4534621573,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50NDUzNDYyMTU3Mw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/webpack/webpack/issues/events/4534621573","actor":{"login":"sokra","id":1365881,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNjU4ODE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1365881?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra","html_url":"https://github.com/sokra","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-03-31T13:10:44Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
