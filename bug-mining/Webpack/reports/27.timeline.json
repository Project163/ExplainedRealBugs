Luckily, each of the projects is simple. You can reproduce the bug in less than five minutes. Follow these steps:\r\n\r\n* checkout the repo\r\n* git checkout webpack-issue-9156\r\n* cd into the new folder\r\n* cd basket/source/basket\r\n* npm install\r\n* ng build --prod\r\n\r\nNow you should see the error. It's a regression between 4.31.0 and 4.32.0.\r\n ","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/webpack/webpack/issues/comments/494324068/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"stephanrauh","id":3045767,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwNDU3Njc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3045767?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/stephanrauh","html_url":"https://github.com/stephanrauh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stephanrauh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stephanrauh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stephanrauh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stephanrauh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stephanrauh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stephanrauh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stephanrauh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stephanrauh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stephanrauh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/webpack/webpack/issues/comments/494328467","html_url":"https://github.com/webpack/webpack/issues/9156#issuecomment-494328467","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/webpack/webpack/issues/9156","id":494328467,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ5NDMyODQ2Nw==","user":{"login":"ttudor","id":1757152,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NTcxNTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1757152?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ttudor","html_url":"https://github.com/ttudor","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ttudor/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ttudor/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ttudor/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ttudor/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ttudor/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ttudor/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ttudor/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ttudor/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ttudor/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-05-21T10:09:31Z","updated_at":"2019-05-21T10:09:31Z","body":"Long time user of webpack, got into the same problem with mini-css-extract-plugin. Spent some time and this is what I found. My knowledge of Webpack internals is far too superficial to fully  understand it, but I hope it will be of some help to somebody more knowledgeable than myself.\r\n\r\nThe problem (in mini-css-extract-plugin) lies in `loader.js` around line 160;\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\ntext = text.map(line => {\r\n  const module = findModuleById(compilation.modules, line[0]);\r\n  return {\r\n    identifier: module.identifier(),\r\n    content: line[1],\r\n    media: line[2],\r\n    sourceMap: line[3]\r\n  };\r\n});\r\n```\r\nThe problem is that `line[0]` contains `undefined`, so `module` is `null`\r\n\r\nThe `text` is actually a `module.exports` coming from the following (line 52 of `loader.js`):\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nconst exec = (loaderContext, code, filename) => {\r\n  const module = new _module.default(filename, loaderContext);\r\n  module.paths = _module.default._nodeModulePaths(loaderContext.context); // eslint-disable-line no-underscore-dangle\r\n  module.filename = filename;\r\n  module._compile(code, filename); // eslint-disable-line no-underscore-dangle\r\n  return module.exports;\r\n};\r\n\r\n// _module is defined as follows:\r\n\r\nvar _module = _interopRequireDefault(require(\"module\"));\r\nfunction _interopRequireDefault(obj) { return obj && obj.__esModule ? obj : { default: obj }; }\r\n```\r\nUp to 4.31.0, the `module.exports` contains a list of of lists, the first element of the first list (the `line[0]` above) being `0`.\r\nOnce we get to 4.32.0 the first element of the first list is `undefined`.\r\n\r\nThis is as far as I could get, and as said already - I am not knowledgeable enough to go deeper.\r\nMaybe a problem with the way the module identifier is handled for ES modules ? Wild guessing ...\r\nCheers
