Important: when resolved by Webpack, `@wordpress/data` is loaded from `node_modules/@wordpress/data/build-module`, aliasing it to `node_modules/@wordpress/data/build` shows the problem. AFAIK the only difference is `build-module` uses ESM and `build` uses CJS.\r\n\r\n- It hits https://github.com/webpack/webpack/blob/master/lib/optimize/ConcatenatedModule.js#L413, trying to find the export for `Children` (which I believe it is reexported by https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/blob/master/packages/element/src/index.js#L2).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n**What is the current behavior?**\r\n\r\nWebpack throws\r\n```\r\nERROR in ./node_modules/@wordpress/element/build-module/index.js + 1 modules\r\nTarget module of reexport from './node_modules/@wordpress/element/build-module/index.js' is not part of the concatenation\r\n```\r\n\r\n**If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce.**\r\n1.
