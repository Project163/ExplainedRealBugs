`HTMLWebpackPlugin`.\r\nRemoving `HTMLWebpackPlugin` fixes the issue, and running `webpack` instead of `webpack serve` also fixes it.\r\n\r\nI noticed this since I am using a custom plugin that relies on the `compiler.hooks.afterEmit` hook, and this one is now called twice.\r\nAlso, observe two ` Compiled successfully.` messages in the terminal output below:\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n <summary>See full

run, i.e. one call of `compiler.hooks.afterEmit` and only one output like this in the console after running `webpack serve`:\r\n```\r\n<i> webpack 5.11.0 compiled successfully in 1573 ms\r\n<i> [webpack-dev-middleware] Compiled successfully.\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Reproduction Example 👾\r\n\r\nI created a repro example here: https://github.com/tzimmermann/webpack-double-compile\r\nBut afterwards, I noticed that also the [codesandbox template](https://codesandbox.io/s/html-webpack-plugin-5x-alpha-d37s2?file=/webpack.config.js) inhibits this bug already.\r\n<!--\r\n\r\nPlease provide a minimal example how to reproduce your problem..\r\nDelete all plugins which are unrelated   \r\nDelete all loaders which are unrelated  \r\nDelete the production webpack config if your bug happens on develop\r\nDelete the develop webpack config if your bug happens only on production\r\n\r\nFeel free to use this codebox template as a starting point: https://codesandbox.io/s/html-webpack-plugin-5x-alpha-d37s2?file=/webpack.config.js\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## Environment 🖥\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nTo help you we need to know which versions you using otherwise it is impossible to help you.  \r\nPlease run the following commands to see your current versions:\r\n\r\n```\r\nnode -e \"var os=require('os');console.log('Node.js ' + process.version + '\\n' +

[Webpack 5 has been released](https://webpack.js.org/blog/2020-10-10-webpack-5-release/)! 👍 \r\n\r\nDuring the beta I tried to provide a html-webpack-plugin version which is compatible to webpack 4 **and** webpack 5.  \r\nAs there have been some API and typing changes in webpack 5 this approach is limited.\r\n\r\nTo provide the best possible webpack 5 support I have started on a dedicated webpack 5 version of the html-webpack-plugin.\r\n\r\n## current progress:\r\n\r\n- [x] drop webpack 4 support\r\n- [x] drop node < 10 [like webpack](https://github.com/webpack/webpack/blob/da67529a213ccb0e687d5f95144faad7bdf26a53/package.json#L106-L108)\r\n- [x] make use of Compiler.hook.initialize to get the latest options\r\n- [x] update typings for webpack 5\r\n- [x] fix scriptLoading defer for inject false\r\n- [x] make scriptLoading defer the default\r\n- [x] add assets in Compilation.PROCESS_ASSETS_STAGE_ADDITIONAL (see https://github.com/webpack/webpack/issues/11425#issuecomment-686606318 )\r\n- [x] add assets with new api `compilation.emitAsset` (#1522)\r\n- [x] use `new webpack.sources.RawSource(html)` to create assets\r\n- [x] add support for `[name]`\r\n- [x] provide options and output name in all hooks\r\n- [x] allow filename to be a function\r\n- [x] emitAssets even if they have been generated in a previous compilation (to fix #1476 and #1432)\r\n- [x] use [`compiler.webpack.LibraryTemplatePlugin`](https://github.com/webpack/webpack/issues/11909)\r\n- [x] verify support for raw-loader (blocked by https://github.com/webpack/webpack/issues/11909)\r\n- [x] remove `@types/tapable` as it is included in tapable 2\r\n- [x] provide a publicPath to the child compiler to add support for `publicPath: 'auto'` & `'asset/resource'` (https://github.com/webpack/webpack/issues/11968#issuecomment-725117719)\r\n- [x] use the correct stage to allow sri and service worker generation (blocked by https://github.com/webpack/webpack/issues/11822)\r\n- [x] fix error reporting (which is currently breaking the travis build)\r\n- [x] use the html-webpack-plugin `publicPath` option also for the template child compilation\r\n\r\n- ~~remove html-minification (if a separate plugin which covers the html minification is available)~~ (postponed)\r\n\r\n## current blockers (help needed by the webpack team):\r\n\r\n- [x] [webpack/issues/11822](https://github.com/webpack/webpack/issues/11822)\r\n- [x] [webpack/issues/11909](https://github.com/webpack/webpack/issues/11909)\r\n- [x] https://github.com/webpack/webpack/issues/12214\r\n\r\n## current alpha playround:\r\n\r\n[CodeSandbox of the html-webpack-plugin 5.0.0-alpha.17 <img width=\"710\" alt=\"html-webpack-plugin_5_x_alpha_-_CodeSandbox\"

of the work is done just by me in my spare time for fun - so if this work helps you feel free to buy me a beer 🍺

branch\r\n* [ ] Investigate if transpilation of node modules is still working *(https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/issues/9994#issuecomment-871499779 could indicate an issue)*\r\n* [x] #11170\r\n* [x] Compilation hook causes the CLI screen to rerender causing bad DX *(fixed in #11170)*\r\n* [x] ~Webpack 5 dependency resolution, some packages seem to depend on v4 breaking npm resolution *(need to investigate, ref: https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/issues/9994#issuecomment-871510627 - could not reproduce on latest version of webpack 5)*~\r\n\r\n## Webpack 5 maybe later?\r\n* [x] `webpack-dev-server` is currently in `v4.0.0-beta.3` for webpack 5 support *(v3.x also seem to work?)*\r\n\r\nRegarding federated modules:\r\n~* [ ] The Webpack dev server doesn't yet support federated modules so we'll likely have to wait a bit on that.~\r\nOut of scope - read more in #9510 \r\n\r\nReferences:\r\n* [Webpack 5 Draft pull-request](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/pull/7929#issuecomment-706736833)\r\n* [Experimental branch](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/pull/7929#issuecomment-602994757)\r\n* [More findings](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/pull/7929#issuecomment-706736833)\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n* We are currently trying to not include node js builtin shims, it's potentially a breaking change if using packages meant for backend usage or mixed frontend/backend packages. *(it happens that newcommers to Npm include backend packages in their frontend code, would be great to prevent this)*\r\n* PnP is supported as default in Webpack 5 and `fork-ts-checker-webpack-plugin` as I read it - but it would be great to QA / fix the
