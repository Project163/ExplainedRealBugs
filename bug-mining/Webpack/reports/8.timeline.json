document:\r\nhttps://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/performance/webpack/\r\n\r\n* **Loader/bundler:**\r\nWebpack (v4)\r\n\r\n**Current behavior:**\r\nWebpack config is not optimised\r\n\r\n* **What is the expected behavior?**\r\nWebpack config should have some basic level of optimisation and documentation should cover more advanced optimisations.\r\n\r\n* **What is the motivation / use case for changing the behavior?**\r\nTo provide an improved out of the box development experience.\r\n\r\nFollowing on from this: https://github.com/aurelia/cli/issues/958 i have learned more about webpack optimisations and tested some configs against different code both Aurelia and non-Aurelia.\r\n\r\nChunk splitting seems to be one of the most important aspects of optimisation provided that we are already using minification of both js and css.\r\n\r\nThe CLI generated webpack config does js minification in production mode as it enabled by default in webpack v4 but does not perform CSS minification without an additional plugin.\r\n\r\nI will talk about chunk splitting first with some test results.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/aurelia/cli/issues/969/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":2,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/aurelia/cli/issues/969/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":1983568751,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDE5ODM1Njg3NTE=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/webpack/webpack/issues/events/1983568751","actor":{"login":"sokra","id":1365881,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNjU4ODE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1365881?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra","html_url":"https://github.com/sokra","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"799e0bc2e0d60bca9d7d23201419e3668a709943","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/webpack/webpack/commits/799e0bc2e0d60bca9d7d23201419e3668a709943","created_at":"2018-11-23T07:50:20Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"actor":{"login":"sokra","id":1365881,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNjU4ODE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1365881?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra","html_url":"https://github.com/sokra","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-11-23T07:50:37Z","updated_at":"2018-11-23T07:50:37Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/webpack/webpack/issues/8410","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/webpack/webpack","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/webpack/webpack/issues/8410/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/webpack/webpack/issues/8410/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/webpack/webpack/issues/8410/events","html_url":"https://github.com/webpack/webpack/pull/8410","id":383728077,"node_id":"MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0MjMzMTI1MzY5","number":8410,"title":"handle
