What example does this report relate to?\r\n\r\nwith-web-worker\r\n\r\n### What version of Next.js are you using?\r\n\r\n10.0.6 -> 10.0.8\r\n\r\n### What version of Node.js are you using?\r\n\r\nv14.16\r\n\r\n### What browser are you using?\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n### What operating system are you using?\r\n\r\nUbuntu 20.04\r\n\r\n### How are you deploying your application?\r\n\r\nboth (next start) and (next export) are effected\r\n\r\n### Describe the Bug\r\n\r\nIn production mode, an app that uses webpack 5's builtin support for web worker will try to load the web worker js from (emphasis mine):\r\n\r\n> _next/static/chunks/185.**undefined**.js\r\n\r\nThis will fail due to the file not existing even though webpack will successfully output the chunk:\r\n\r\n```\r\n_next/static/chunks/185.5767725c6bc7a481fcd4.js\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis does not effect development. The web worker loads and executes fine in development, though the worker does log the following error:\r\n\r\n> ReferenceError: assignment to undeclared variable _N_E\r\n\r\n### Expected Behavior\r\n\r\nFor the web worker to be bundled appropriately for production builds\r\n\r\n### To Reproduce\r\n\r\nTake the web worker example:\r\n\r\n```\r\nnpx create-next-app --example with-web-worker with-web-worker-app\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd apply the following changes\r\n\r\nReplace **next.config.js** with:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nmodule.exports = {\r\n  future: {\r\n    webpack5: true,\r\n  },\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n**pages/index.js**\r\n\r\n```diff\r\n--- a/pages/index.js\r\n+++ b/pages/index.js\r\n@@ -3,7 +3,7 @@ import { useEffect, useRef, useCallback } from 'react'\r\n export default function Index() {\r\n   const workerRef = useRef()\r\n   useEffect(() => {\r\n-    workerRef.current = new Worker('../worker.js', { type: 'module' })\r\n+    workerRef.current = new Worker(new URL('../worker.js', import.meta.url));\r\n     workerRef.current.onmessage = (evt) =>\r\n       alert(`WebWorker Response => ${evt.data}`)\r\n     return () => {\r\n```\r\n\r\nOptionally remove `worker-loader` dependency as webpack 5 has web worker support builtin \r\n\r\nExecute:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nnpm run build && npm run start\r\n```\r\n\r\nOpen the page and the console will immediately log the error. This effects `next export` as well.\r\n\r\nI did try and see if https://github.com/vercel/next.js/pull/21977 fixes the issue (rebasing it off v10.0.8 in the process), but it did not.\r\n\r\nThis is the continuation of the following discussion: https://github.com/vercel/next.js/issues/22096\r\n\r\nEDIT: current debugging status:\r\n - doesn't appear related to the split chunks config as setting it to dev mode doesn't resolve the issue. \r\n - current best guess is that it has something to do with the addition of [async anonymous entrypoints](https://github.com/webpack/webpack/commit/ed06a7f83a7cb7542ff7d9df9fa9755154679258)\r\n - react-loadable-manifest.json contains a top level `\"undefined\"` key :thinking: ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js/issues/22813/reactions","total_count":10,"+1":10,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js/issues/22813/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
