Bug report\r\n\r\n**What is the current behavior?**\r\n\r\nAn error is thrown when attempting to use optimization.splitChunks.maxSize or optimization.splitChunks.cacheGroups.{cachegroupname}.maxSize\r\n\r\nExample config:\r\n```\r\noptimization: {\r\n    splitChunks: {\r\n      chunks: \"initial\",\r\n      //maxSize: 10000,\r\n      cacheGroups: {\r\n        default: false, // disable the built-in groups, default & vendors (vendors is overwritten below)\r\n        vendors: {\r\n          test: /[\\\\/]node_modules[\\\\/]/,\r\n          name: \"vendors\",\r\n          priority: 10,\r\n          //enforce: true, // create chunk regardless of the size of the chunk\r\n          maxSize: 10000\r\n        }\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n  },\r\n```\r\n\r\nthrows the following error:\r\n```\r\nsetup/node_modules/webpack/lib/util/deterministicGrouping.js:168\r\n\t\t\t\tleftSize += group.nodes[left].size;\r\n\t\t\t\t                              ^\r\nTypeError: Cannot read property 'size' of undefined\r\n    at module.exports (......../minimal-react-webpack-babel-setup/node_modules/webpack/lib/util/deterministicGrouping.js:168:35)\r\n    at compilation.hooks.optimizeChunksAdvanced.tap.chunks (......../minimal-react-webpack-babel-setup/node_modules/webpack/lib/optimize/SplitChunksPlugin.js:797:23)\r\n```\r\n\r\nSetting maxSize at the splitChunks level causes the same error.\r\n\r\nUncommenting the line `//enforce: true,` removes the error but causes the build to hang.\r\n\r\n**If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce.**\r\n\r\nClone the following repo:\r\nhttps://github.com/chrisckc/minimal-react-webpack-babel-setup\r\n\r\nFollow the instructions in the readme\r\n\r\nThis error was first spotted in a more complex app, so i found and forked a less complex app repo to verify the bug.\r\n\r\nI can't make the demo repo any simpler because there needs to be enough node modules available to recreate the issue.\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\n\r\nIt should create multiple 'vendors' chunks each capped at maxSize or as close as possible.\r\n\r\n**Other relevant information:**\r\nwebpack version:  v4.23.1\r\nNode.js version: v8.11.4\r\nOperating System: MacOS 10.13.4\r\nAdditional tools: VSCode, mac terminal\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"sokra","id":1365881,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNjU4ODE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1365881?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra","html_url":"https://github.com/sokra","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/webpack/webpack/issues/8407/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/webpack/webpack/issues/8407/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
