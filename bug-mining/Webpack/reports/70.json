report\r\n\r\nAssuming you have a JSON file `prices.json` with the following content:\r\n```json\r\n[\r\n    {\r\n      \"key\": \"startup\",\r\n      \"title\": \"Startup\",\r\n      \"price\": 75\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n      \"key\": \"basic\",\r\n      \"title\": \"Basic\",\r\n      \"price\": 150,\r\n      \"featured\": true\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n      \"key\": \"partnership\",\r\n      \"title\": \"Partnership\",\r\n      \"price\": null\r\n    }\r\n  ]\r\n```\r\nNote that the root object is simply an array.\r\n\r\nAnd you import it using the default export as required by Webpack 5:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nimport pricing from \"./pricing.json\";\r\n```\r\n\r\n<!-- Please ask questions on StackOverflow or the webpack Gitter. -->\r\n<!-- https://stackoverflow.com/questions/ask?tags=webpack -->\r\n<!-- https://gitter.im/webpack/webpack -->\r\n<!-- Issues which contain questions or support requests will be closed. -->\r\n\r\n**What is the current behavior?**\r\n\r\nGives an error when Next.js tries to compile:\r\n\r\n```\r\nTypeError: undefined is not a function\r\n```\r\n\r\n**If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce.**\r\n\r\n<!-- A great way to do this is to provide your configuration via a GitHub repository -->\r\n<!-- The most helpful is a minimal reproduction with instructions on how to reproduce -->\r\n<!-- Repositories with too many files or large `webpack.config.js` files are not suitable -->\r\n<!-- Please only add small code snippets directly into this issue -->\r\n<!-- https://gist.github.com is a good place for longer code snippets -->\r\n<!-- If your issue is caused by a plugin or loader, please create an issue on the loader/plugin repository instead -->\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\n\r\nI believe it should be possible to map the prices.\r\n```ts\r\nprices.map((price) => console.log)\r\n```\r\n\r\nChanging the `prices.json` to be an object with a key works:\r\n\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n  \"prices\": [\r\n    {\r\n      \"key\": \"startup\",\r\n      \"title\": \"Startup\",\r\n      \"price\": 75\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n      \"key\": \"basic\",\r\n      \"title\": \"Basic\",\r\n      \"price\": 150,\r\n      \"featured\": true\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n      \"key\": \"partnership\",\r\n      \"title\": \"Partnership\",\r\n      \"price\": null\r\n    }\r\n  ]\r\n}\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nWorks now using the additional key\r\n```ts\r\nprices.prices.map((price) => console.log)\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- \"It should work\" is not a helpful explanation -->\r\n<!-- Explain exactly how it should behave -->\r\n\r\n**Other relevant information:**\r\nwebpack version:  `webpack@5.0.0-rc.3`\r\nNode.js version: `v12.18.3`\r\nOperating
