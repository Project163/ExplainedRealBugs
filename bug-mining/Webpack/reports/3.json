Let's call them `A` and `B` they have some modules in common but are loaded on separate pages for example mobile/regular site or internal website / public facing website. therefor it makes more sense to have two dedicated bundles and no common chunk.\r\nBundle `A` has a dependency on Module `M` in form of a dynamic import i.e. `import(\"./M\")` Bundle B has the same file with a dynamic import but also some regular imports of module M in other files i.e. `import M from \"./M\"`\r\nwhen bundling A and B (config `splitChunks -> false` and default `optimization.runtimeChunk: false`). the B bundle has the `__webpack_require__.e(/*! import() | M */ \"M\")` code to request loading the M chunk. but misses the requireEnsure function (i.e. `__webpack_require__.e = function requireEnsure(chunkId) {`) in its runtime which is only present in the A bundle. And would result to a `__webpack_require__.e is not a function` runtime exception.\r\nWhen removing the entry point for A from the webpack config, then instead of the requireEnsure call there is a Promise.resolve with the module M which was loaded for the reqular imports.\r\nwhen removing the regular imports of the Module M from the B then the `requireEnsure` function definition is present in both bundles.\r\nThere is a workaround to use `optimization.runtimeChunk: \"single\"` and load the generated runtime with the requireEnsure part for both bundles. but i would prefer one js file to be generated and needed to be loaded.\r\n\r\n**If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce.**\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- A great way to do this is to provide your configuration via a GitHub repository -->\r\n<!-- The most helpful is a minimal reproduction with instructions on how to reproduce -->\r\n<!-- Repositories with too many files or large `webpack.config.js` files are not suitable -->\r\n<!-- Please only add small code snippets directly into this issue -->\r\n<!-- https://gist.github.com is a good place for longer code snippets -->\r\n<!-- If your issue is caused by a plugin or loader, please create an issue on the loader/plugin repository instead -->\r\nA CodeSandbox with minimal setup to reproduce this issue and the results are provided under:\r\nhttps://codesandbox.io/s/llplqpml2q\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\nThe B bundle should have Promise.resolve and reference to the already loaded Module M, even if another entrypoint is defined in the webpack config.\r\n\r\n<!-- \"It should work\" is not a helpful explanation -->\r\n<!-- Explain exactly how it should behave -->\r\n\r\n**Other relevant information:**\r\nwebpack version:  4.20.2\r\nNode.js version: v8.4.0\r\nOperating System:  windows 10\r\nAdditional tools: `\r\n    \"@babel/core\": \"7.1.0\",\r\n    \"@babel/plugin-syntax-dynamic-import\": \"7.0.0\",\r\n    \"@babel/preset-env\": \"7.1.0\",\r\n    \"babel-loader\": \"8.0.3\",`\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"sokra","id":1365881,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNjU4ODE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1365881?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra","html_url":"https://github.com/sokra","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/webpack/webpack/issues/8110/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/webpack/webpack/issues/8110/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
