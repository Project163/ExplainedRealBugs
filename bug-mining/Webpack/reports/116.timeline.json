are in the wrong order.\r\n\r\n**If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce.**\r\nI'm not sure how to get this to happen outside of my app, but I have a component that does something like:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nimport { DataURIs } from '../constants';\r\n\r\nconst { BLANK_IMAGE } = DataURIs;\r\n\r\nfunction test (data = {}) {\r\n\tconst {\r\n\t\tsrc = BLANK_IMAGE,\r\n\t} = data;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nand `src` becomes something like `{src = constants_BLANK_IMAGE : src_constants_BLANK_IMAGE}`... which is backwards.\r\n\r\n<!-- A great way to do this is to provide your configuration via a GitHub repository -->\r\n<!-- The most helpful is a minimal reproduction with instructions on how to reproduce -->\r\n<!-- Repositories with too many files or large `webpack.config.js` files are not suitable -->\r\n<!-- Please only add small code snippets directly into this issue -->\r\n<!-- https://gist.github.com is a good place for longer code snippets -->\r\n<!-- If your issue is caused by a plugin or loader, please create an issue on the loader/plugin repository instead -->\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\nno syntax error.\r\n\r\n<!-- \"It should work\" is not a helpful explanation -->\r\n<!-- Explain exactly how it should behave -->\r\n\r\n**Other relevant information:**\r\nwebpack version:  5.24.0\r\nNode.js version:
