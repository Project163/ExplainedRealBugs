The reason for that is that we have an `AssignmentPattern` at index `1`, while the `Property` we want to change is now at index `2`.\r\n\r\n## The fix\r\n\r\nThis PR simply adds an additional check for this condition, and creates output like this instead:\r\n\r\n```diff\r\n- const { src_testProp = \"defaultValue\" } = config;\r\n+ const { testProp: src_testProp = \"defaultValue\" } = config;\r\n```\r\n\r\nCloses #12712 \r\n\r\n**What kind of change does this PR introduce?**\r\n\r\nbugfix\r\n\r\n**Did you add tests for your changes?**\r\n\r\nYes\r\n\r\n**Does this PR introduce a breaking change?**\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n**What needs to be documented once your changes are merged?**\r\n\r\nNone, this is expected behaviour\r\n<!-- List all the information that needs to be added to the documentation after merge -->\r\n<!-- When your changes are merged you will be asked to contribute this to the documentation -->\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/webpack/webpack/issues/12720/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/webpack/webpack/issues/12720/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":4358096861,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50NDM1ODA5Njg2MQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/webpack/webpack/issues/events/4358096861","actor":{"login":"sokra","id":1365881,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNjU4ODE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1365881?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra","html_url":"https://github.com/sokra","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-02-22T07:46:14Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
