Therefore calls to `x-undefined.js` are being made.\r\n\r\nFor some reason everything seems to be working only when also adding `NamedModulesPlugin` which is according to the docs optional. It seems it's actually mandatory.\r\n\r\n**Important Note:** I did NOT test it using the CLI option. Everything has been tested using the `WebpackDevServer` API.\r\n\r\n**If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce.**\r\n\r\nJust add an HMR support to a project by adding:\r\n\r\n```js\r\n    filename: '[name]-[chunkhash].js',\r\n    chunkFilename: '[name]-[chunkhash].js',\r\n```\r\n\r\n```js\r\nconfig.entry.application.unshift('react-hot-loader/patch');\r\nconfig.entry.application.unshift('webpack/hot/dev-server');\r\nconfig.entry.application.unshift(`webpack-dev-server/client?${config.output.publicPath}`);\r\n```\r\n\r\n```js\r\n// HMR (Hot Module Replacement) plugins\r\nconfig.plugins.push(new webpack.HotModuleReplacementPlugin());\r\n```\r\n\r\nAdd `hot: true` to the `WebpackDevServer` configurations.\r\n\r\nThe above fails.\r\n\r\nNow, try also adding:\r\n```js\r\nconfig.plugins.push(new webpack.NamedModulesPlugin());\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow everything is working again.\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\n\r\nThe expected behavior would be that HMR will work without the need to add `NamedModulesPlugin`.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Please mention other relevant information such as the browser version, Node.js version, webpack version and Operating System.**\r\n\r\nWebpack version: 2.3.3\r\nNode.js version: 6.10.1\r\nOS:
