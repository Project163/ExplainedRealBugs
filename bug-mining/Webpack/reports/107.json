tree-shaked\r\n\r\n**If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce.**\r\n\r\n[Exmaple repo](https://github.com/barak007/webpack-asset-url-bug)\r\nfollow steps in readme\r\n\r\n<!-- A great way to do this is to provide your configuration via a GitHub repository -->\r\n<!-- The most helpful is a minimal reproduction with instructions on how to reproduce -->\r\n<!-- Repositories with too many files or large `webpack.config.js` files are not suitable -->\r\n<!-- Please only add small code snippets directly into this issue -->\r\n<!-- https://gist.github.com is a good place for longer code snippets -->\r\n<!-- If your issue is caused by a plugin or loader, please create an issue on the loader/plugin repository instead -->\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\n\r\nI expected the bundle to not contain the asset module and the dist folder to not contain the asset file.\r\n\r\n* When I force sideEffects false it dose remove the entire thing.\r\n\r\n<!-- \"It should work\" is not a helpful explanation -->\r\n<!-- Explain exactly how it should behave -->\r\n\r\n**Other relevant information:**\r\nwebpack
