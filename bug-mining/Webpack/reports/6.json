upgrading from webpack v3.6.0 to v4.23.1\r\n\r\n**If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce.**\r\n```js\r\nnew webpack.DefinePlugin({\r\n\tNAME: 'foobar'\r\n})\r\n```\r\nthen:\r\n```js\r\nimport(`./${NAME}.yaml`)\r\n```\r\n\r\nexpands to:\r\n\r\n```js\r\n__webpack_require__(\"../mytest lazy recursive ^\\\\.\\\\/.*\\\\.yaml$\")('./' + NAME + '.yaml')\r\n```\r\n\r\nthat is not correct.\r\n\r\n<!-- A great way to do this is to provide your configuration via a GitHub repository -->\r\n<!-- The most helpful is a minimal reproduction with instructions on how to reproduce -->\r\n<!-- Repositories with too many files or large `webpack.config.js` files are not suitable -->\r\n<!-- Please only add small code snippets directly into this
