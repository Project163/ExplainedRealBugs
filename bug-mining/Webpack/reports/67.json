Example of the resulting error in chrome:\r\n\r\n```\r\nUncaught (in promise) Error: Loading chunk 63 failed.\r\n(error: https://{hostname}/app/63.undefined.feasContentHashV1.chunk.js)\r\n    at HTMLScriptElement.i ({appName}.d5b0c78176fe6ff82a0f.bundle.js:1)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe request for chunk 63 looks like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\nhttps://{hostname}/app/63.undefined.chunk.js\r\n```\r\n\r\nStepping through the webpack build, it appears as though the function `getScriptSrcPath` in `JsonpMainTemplatePlugin.js` ([link](https://github.com/webpack/webpack/blob/a0eab48f3799f5d3528b0c0c3a0e48161a43933c/lib/web/JsonpMainTemplatePlugin.js#L47)) creates a mapping of chunk Id to hash. Looking at the result, the entry for the chunk Id 63 is missing entirely, resulting in the `undefined` hash in the request.\r\n\r\nHowever, looking through the resulting build, there appears to be a valid chunk 63 with a valid hash in the file name. I'm guessing that somewhere along the line, the reference is lost to this chunk?\r\n\r\n**If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce.**\r\n\r\nThis is somewhat difficult to reproduce, I think its related to the total number of async chunks made by `splitChunksPlugin`, but I'm not 100% sure. I'm unable to reproduce a build that can do this. please let me now what other information would be useful.\r\n\r\nI think this may be related to https://github.com/webpack/webpack/issues/7061 since the behavior sounds similar. However, according to the maintainers that bug was fixed in 4.6.0. Since we are at a later version (4.29.0) I would expect that fix to be included.\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\n\r\nI would expect `JsonpMainTemplatePlugin` to produce code that has a valid mapping of all chunk Id's to their respective hashes, and for all requests for chunks to have defined hashes.\r\n\r\n**Other relevant information:**\r\nwebpack version:  4.29.0 (I also tried linking to a develop build of webpack)\r\nNode.js version: v8.11.1\r\nOperating System: MacOS\r\nAdditional tools:\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"sokra","id":1365881,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNjU4ODE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1365881?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra","html_url":"https://github.com/sokra","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/webpack/webpack/issues/8677/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/webpack/webpack/issues/8677/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
