Bug report\r\n\r\n**What is the current behavior?**\r\nWebpack replace \"new.target\" by \"Object()\" which cause error.\r\n\r\n**If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce.**\r\n\r\n> index.ts\r\n```typescript\r\nclass A {\r\n\tstatic get instance() {\r\n\t\treturn Reflect.construct(A, [], B);\r\n\t}\r\n\t\r\n\tconstructor() {\r\n\t\tif (new.target != B)

\"target\": \"ESNext\",\r\n    \"module\": \"commonjs\",\r\n    \"strict\": true\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\n> npx webpack index.ts --output dist.js\r\n```\r\n\r\n------------------------------\r\n\r\nTypeScript is transpiled right:\r\n```javascript\r\n\"use strict\";\r\nclass A {\r\n    static get instance() {\r\n        return Reflect.construct(A, [], B);\r\n    }\r\n    constructor() {\r\n        if (new.target != B) {\r\n            throw new Error();\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n}\r\nclass B extends A {\r\n}\r\nconsole.log(A.instance);\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut output of dist.js is:\r\n```javascript\r\n(() => {\r\n    class t {\r\n        static get instance() {\r\n            return Reflect.construct(t, [], c)\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        constructor() {\r\n            if (Object() != c) throw new Error // THIS IS THE BUG!\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    class c extends t {\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    console.log(t.instance)\r\n})();\r\n```\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\n\"new.target\" should be leaved as is. \r\n\r\n**Other relevant information:**\r\nNode.js version: 14.4\r\nOperating System: Win 10\r\n```json\r\n  \"dependencies\": {\r\n    \"typescript\": \"^3.9.7\",\r\n    \"webpack\": \"^5.0.0-beta.25\"\r\n  },\r\n  \"devDependencies\": {\r\n
