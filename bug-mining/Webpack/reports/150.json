The bug seems to occur when `modules` is `undefined` in `lib/css/CssModulesPlugin.js:363`. Wrapping the following lines in the condition below fixes the error. \r\n","closed_by":{"login":"alexander-akait","id":4567934,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1Njc5MzQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4567934?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexander-akait","html_url":"https://github.com/alexander-akait","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexander-akait/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexander-akait/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexander-akait/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexander-akait/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexander-akait/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexander-akait/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexander-akait/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexander-akait/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexander-akait/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/webpack/webpack/issues/18511/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/webpack/webpack/issues/18511/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
