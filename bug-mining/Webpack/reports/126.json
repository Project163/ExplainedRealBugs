(target is node)\r\n\r\n(minimal example)\r\n\r\nwebpack config:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nconst cfg = {\r\n  mode: \"production\",\r\n  target: \"node\",\r\n  output: {\r\n    libraryTarget: \"commonjs2\",\r\n  },\r\n  entry: \"./src/entry.js\",\r\n  optimization: {\r\n    runtimeChunk: \"single\",\r\n    splitChunks: {\r\n      cacheGroups: {\r\n        other: {\r\n          name: \"source-mapped\",\r\n          enforce: true,\r\n          chunks: \"initial\",\r\n          test: /source-mapped\\.js/,\r\n        },\r\n      },\r\n    },\r\n  },\r\n};\r\n\r\nmodule.exports = cfg;\r\n```\r\n\r\nWorks if one removes `runtimeChunk: \"single\"`\r\n\r\nBasically I was hoping that I would be able to be in production, but have some of the source source-mapped and the rest not. So I was trying to have a separate chunk for certain files and later would enable source mapping on that file. Also would be nice to have a single common runtime between all entry points.\r\n\r\n**If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce.**\r\n\r\n[example repo](https://github.com/iPherian/webpack-v5-node-split-chunks-bug)\r\n\r\n- `git clone https://github.com/iPherian/webpack-v5-node-split-chunks-bug.git`\r\n- `cd webpack-v5-node-split-chunks-bug`\r\n- `npm init`\r\n- `npm install webpack webpack-cli`\r\n- `./node_modules/.bin/webpack`\r\n- `node ./test-dist.js # just require's dist/main.js`\r\n\r\n<!-- A great way to do this is to provide your configuration via a GitHub repository -->\r\n<!-- The most helpful is a minimal reproduction with instructions on how to reproduce -->\r\n<!-- Repositories with too many files or large `webpack.config.js` files are not suitable -->\r\n<!-- Please only add small code snippets directly into this issue -->\r\n<!-- https://gist.github.com is a good place for longer code snippets -->\r\n<!-- If your issue is caused by a plugin or loader, please create an issue on the loader/plugin repository instead -->\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\n\r\nShould be able to require dist/main.js without error.\r\n\r\n<!-- \"It should work\" is not a helpful explanation -->\r\n<!-- Explain exactly how it should behave -->\r\n\r\n**Other relevant information:**\r\nwebpack version: v5.32.0\r\nNode.js version: v14.16.1\r\nOperating System: Win 10 x64 1909 18363.1316\r\nAdditional tools: n/a\r\n\r\nError trace:\r\n```\r\nError: Cannot find module './undefined'\r\nRequire stack:\r\n- C:\\src\\webpack-v5-node-split-chunks-bug\\dist\\runtime.js\r\n- C:\\src\\webpack-v5-node-split-chunks-bug\\dist\\main.js\r\n- C:\\src\\webpack-v5-node-split-chunks-bug\\test-dist.js\r\n           at Function.Module._resolveFilename (internal/modules/cjs/loader.js:880:15)\r\n           at Function.Module._load (internal/modules/cjs/loader.js:725:27)\r\n           at Module.require (internal/modules/cjs/loader.js:952:19)\r\n           at require (internal/modules/cjs/helpers.js:88:18)\r\n    at Object.s.f.require (C:\\src\\webpack-v5-node-split-chunks-bug\\dist\\runtime.js:1:569)\r\n    at C:\\src\\webpack-v5-node-split-chunks-bug\\dist\\runtime.js:1:226\r\n    at Array.reduce (<anonymous>)\r\n    at Function.s.e (C:\\src\\webpack-v5-node-split-chunks-bug\\dist\\runtime.js:1:204)\r\n    at Array.map (<anonymous>)\r\n    at Function.s.X (C:\\src\\webpack-v5-node-split-chunks-bug\\dist\\runtime.js:1:352) {\r\n  code: 'MODULE_NOT_FOUND',\r\n  requireStack: [\r\n    'C:\\\\src\\\\webpack-v5-node-split-chunks-bug\\\\dist\\\\runtime.js',\r\n    'C:\\\\src\\\\webpack-v5-node-split-chunks-bug\\\\dist\\\\main.js',\r\n    'C:\\\\src\\\\webpack-v5-node-split-chunks-bug\\\\test-dist.js'\r\n  ]\r\n}\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nwebpack bundle output:\r\n\r\n```\r\nasset runtime.js 626 bytes [compared for emit] [minimized] (name: runtime)\r\nasset main.js 237 bytes [compared for emit] [minimized] (name: main)\r\nasset source-mapped.js 118 bytes [compared for emit] [minimized] (name: source-mapped) (id hint: other)\r\nEntrypoint main 981 bytes = runtime.js 626 bytes source-mapped.js 118 bytes main.js 237 bytes\r\nruntime modules 1.86 KiB 5 modules\r\ncacheable modules 219 bytes\r\n  ./src/entry.js 124 bytes [built] [code generated]\r\n  ./src/source-mapped.js 95 bytes [built] [code generated]\r\nwebpack 5.32.0 compiled successfully in 204 ms\r\n```","closed_by":{"login":"sokra","id":1365881,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNjU4ODE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1365881?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra","html_url":"https://github.com/sokra","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/webpack/webpack/issues/13130/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/webpack/webpack/issues/13130/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
