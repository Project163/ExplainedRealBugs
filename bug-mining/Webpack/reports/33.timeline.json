Bug report\r\n\r\n**What is the current behavior?**\r\n\r\nIn ncc we're supporting multi-entry builds with webpack code splitting, where `output.filename` is a function returning `chunk-[id].js` for chunks and `[name]` directly for entry points.\r\n\r\nThe entry points are being output with the following code in their bundles for loading the chunks:\r\n\r\n```js\r\n      /******/  /* webpack/runtime/get javascript chunk filename */\r\n      /******/  !function() {\r\n      /******/          // This function allow to reference async chunks and sibling chunks for the entrypoint\r\n      /******/          __webpack_require__.u = function(chunkId) {\r\n      /******/                  // return url for filenames based on template\r\n      /******/                  return \" + chunkId + \";\r\n      /******/          };\r\n      /******/  }();\r\n```\r\n\r\nwith absolutely no reference to the `chunk-33.js` named form that is being used in the output configuration.\r\n\r\n**If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce.**\r\n\r\nThis can be replicated in ncc with `output.filename` being set to a function in the multi-entry test case.\r\n\r\n<!-- A great way to do this is to provide your configuration via a GitHub repository -->\r\n<!-- The most helpful is a minimal reproduction with instructions on how to reproduce -->\r\n<!-- Repositories with too many files or large `webpack.config.js` files are not suitable -->\r\n<!-- Please only add small code snippets directly into this issue -->\r\n<!-- https://gist.github.com is a good place for longer code snippets -->\r\n<!-- If your issue is caused by a plugin or loader, please create an issue on the loader/plugin repository instead -->\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\n\r\nThis should work as described in the documentation.\r\n\r\n<!-- \"It should work\" is not a helpful explanation -->\r\n<!-- Explain exactly how it should behave -->\r\n\r\n**Other relevant information:**\r\nwebpack version:  \r\nNode.js version: \r\nOperating System: \r\nAdditional
