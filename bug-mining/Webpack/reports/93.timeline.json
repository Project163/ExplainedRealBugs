Changes proposed in this Pull Request\r\n\r\nMigrates Calypso to Webpack 5. This include migrate plugins to Webpack 5, the CLI commands and the config files.\r\n\r\nI added a bunch of comments explaining the reason behind each change pointing to the docs/code that shows the API change introduced in Webpack 5 that prompted that change. I hope that works as a guide to migrate other plugins/apps in case I forgot them.\r\n\r\nNo webpack 5 feature (content based hashes, caches) have been enabled yet, I'll do those on a future PR to reduce the amount of change.\r\n\r\n#### Testing instructions\r\n\r\n* [ ] Deploy Masterbar Notifications to your sandbox (PCYsg-elI-p2) and verify they still work when loaded in an iframe (i.e. from wp-admin)\r\n* [ ] Deploy Editing Toolkit to your sandbox (PCYsg-ly5-p2) and verify it still works\r\n* [ ] Deploy o2-blocks to your sandbox (PCYsg-r7r-p2 and p1610364140355800-slack-C02DQP0FP ) and verify it still works\r\n* [ ] Deploy wpcom-block-editor (PCYsg-l4k-p2) to your sandbox and verify it still works. \r\n* [ ] Switch to a RTL language. As you navigate through calypso you should see .rtl.css files loaded\r\n* [ ] Checkout the branch and verify everything works with `yarn start`\r\n* [ ] Verify Desktop app still works\r\n* [ ] Verify IE11 still works\r\n* [ ] Verify storybooks (`yarn components:storybook:start` and `yarn search:storybook:start`)
