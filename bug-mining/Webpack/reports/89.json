Please don't delete this template because we'll close your issue -->\r\n<!-- Before creating an issue please make sure you are using the latest version of webpack. -->\r\n\r\n# Bug report\r\n\r\n<!--

contain questions or support requests will be closed. -->\r\n\r\n**What is the current behavior?**\r\n\r\nNamed exports for CJS are part of NodeJS LTS 14 and current version 15, and are being [backported to LTS 12](https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/35757), but standard code that runs without issues in NodeJS cannot currently be bundled with webpack due error:\r\n\r\n```\r\nCan't import the named export 'XXX' (imported as 'XXX') from default-exporting module (only default export is available)\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n**If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce.**\r\n\r\ncreate an `esm.js` file with this content:\r\n```js\r\nimport {log, info} from './cjs/cjs.js';\r\n\r\nlog('This works');\r\ninfo('And so does this');\r\n```\r\n\r\nput into `package.json` the following content:\r\n```js\r\n{\"type\": \"module\"}\r\n```\r\n\r\nnow create a `./cjs` folder with a `./cjs/cjs.js` file with the following content:\r\n```js\r\nexports.log = console.log;\r\nexports.info = console.info;\r\n```\r\n\r\nput into `./cjs/package.json` the following content:\r\n```js\r\n{\"type\": \"commonjs\"}\r\n```\r\n\r\nRun `node esm.js` and see this outcome:\r\n```\r\nThis works\r\nAnd so does this\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow try to configure *webpack* any way to use `./esm.js` as entry point and see this outcome:\r\n```\r\n[webpack-cli] Compilation finished\r\nassets by status 254 bytes [cached] 1 asset\r\n./esm.js 86 bytes [built] [code generated]\r\n./cjs/cjs.js 56 bytes [built] [code generated]\r\n\r\nERROR in ./esm.js 3:0-3\r\nCan't import the named export 'log' (imported as 'log') from default-exporting module (only default export is available)\r\n\r\nERROR in ./esm.js 4:0-4\r\nCan't import the named export 'info' (imported as 'info') from default-exporting module (only default export is available)\r\n\r\nwebpack 5.3.2 compiled with 2 errors in 155 ms\r\n```\r\n\r\n<!-- A great way to do this is to provide your configuration via a GitHub repository -->\r\n<!-- The most helpful is a minimal reproduction with instructions on how to reproduce -->\r\n<!-- Repositories with too many files or large `webpack.config.js` files are not suitable -->\r\n<!-- Please only add small code snippets directly into this issue -->\r\n<!-- https://gist.github.com is a good place for longer code snippets -->\r\n<!-- If your issue is caused by a plugin or loader, please create an issue on the loader/plugin repository instead -->\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\n\r\nCommonJS named exports have been available for quite some time, and alternative bundlers seem to be compatible with the current NodeJS standard behavior, but *webpack* is making partial migrations from CJS to ESM a bit harder than it should.\r\n\r\nPlease consider supporting named exports to make migrations smoother, thank you!\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- \"It should work\" is not a helpful explanation -->\r\n<!-- Explain exactly how it should behave -->\r\n\r\n**Other relevant information:**\r\nwebpack version:  5.3.2 / CLI 4.1.0\r\nNode.js version: 12, 14, 15\r\nOperating System: Linux / macOS\r\nAdditional tools: none\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"sokra","id":1365881,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNjU4ODE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1365881?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra","html_url":"https://github.com/sokra","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/webpack/webpack/issues/11878/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/webpack/webpack/issues/11878/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
