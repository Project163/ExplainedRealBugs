For example, if my module exports `someMethod()`, then when I import this System module with Systemjs, the method will be missing:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nSystem.import('my-module').then((myModule) => {\r\n  myModule.someMethod(); // TypeError: myModule.someMethod is not a function\r\n})\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt seems this issue occurs only when the module have an external dependency.\r\n\r\n**If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce.**\r\n\r\nYou'll find a repo to reproduce this issue here: https://github.com/alk-sdavid/webpack-systemjs-issue\r\n\r\n<!-- A great way to do this is to provide your configuration via a GitHub repository -->\r\n<!-- The most helpful is a minimal reproduction with instructions on how to reproduce -->\r\n<!-- Repositories with too many files or large `webpack.config.js` files are not suitable -->\r\n<!-- Please only add small code snippets directly into this issue -->\r\n<!-- https://gist.github.com is a good place for longer code snippets -->\r\n<!-- If your issue is caused by a plugin or loader, please create an issue on the loader/plugin repository instead -->\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\n\r\nI guess Systemjs module bundle should work as it was working with v5.40.0, meaning when I import a systemjs module with Systemjs, I should find exported objects in the response.\r\n\r\n<!-- \"It should work\" is not a helpful explanation -->\r\n<!-- Explain exactly how it should behave -->\r\n\r\n**Other relevant information:**\r\nwebpack version:  5.41.0\r\nNode.js version: 14.17.1\r\nOperating System: MacOS 11.4\r\nAdditional tools: \r\n","closed_by":{"login":"sokra","id":1365881,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNjU4ODE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1365881?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra","html_url":"https://github.com/sokra","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/webpack/webpack/issues/13667/reactions","total_count":6,"+1":6,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/webpack/webpack/issues/13667/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
