`import.meta.id` or `import.meta.webpackId`?\r\n\r\n<!-- Issues that contain questions or support requests will be closed. -->\r\n<!-- Before creating an issue please make sure you are using the latest version of webpack. -->\r\n<!-- Check if this feature needs to be implemented in a plugin or loader instead -->\r\n<!-- If yes: file the issue on the plugin/loader repo -->\r\n<!-- Features related to the development server should be filed on this repo instead -->\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\n\r\nThis would give the same value as `module.id` does today - but only available in strict ESM runtimes.\r\n\r\n**What is motivation or use case for adding/changing the behavior?**\r\n\r\nThe primary use case for this is to implement recoverable self-accepting HMR behaviour.\r\n\r\nIn CommonJS, we would do:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nif (module.hot) {\r\n  function hotAcceptHandler(err) {\r\n    // or `require.cache` instead of `__webpack_require__.c`\r\n    __webpack_require__.c[module.id].hot.accept(hotAcceptHandler);\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  module.hot.accept(hotAcceptHandler);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn strict ESM, I believe it is currently impossible to do so:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nif (import.meta.hot) {\r\n  function hotAcceptHandler(err) {\r\n    // What should be used for `module.id` if `module` is not available?\r\n    __webpack_require__.c[module.id].hot.accept(hotAcceptHandler);\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  import.meta.hot.accept(hotAcceptHandler);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n**How should this be implemented in your opinion?**\r\n\r\nRe-use current implementation of `module.id`, but also inject the value for `import.meta.webpackId`.\r\n\r\n**Are you willing to work on this yourself?**\r\n\r\nYes if this is something that is accepted to be in Webpack.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"sokra","id":1365881,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNjU4ODE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1365881?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra","html_url":"https://github.com/sokra","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/webpack/webpack/issues/12826/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/webpack/webpack/issues/12826/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
