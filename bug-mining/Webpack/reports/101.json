As-is, I can use the `issuer` rule properly to automatically apply a loader to any files that are required by a certain module. But, I need to continue to apply the loader _**recursively**_ to any additional modules that are require'd from modules that are required from the `issuer`.\r\n\r\nMore information about my use-case can be found here:\r\n\r\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/questions/63799399/need-to-apply-a-loader-to-all-dependencies-of-a-certain-file-recursively\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\n\r\nLoaders are applied recursively to all dependencies that are required from the top-level\r\n\r\n**What is motivation or use case for adding/changing the behavior?**\r\n\r\nSee above StackOverflow link.\r\n\r\n**How should this be implemented in your opinion?**\r\n\r\nI'd like to either see the `issuer` field either be extended to apply recursively to all modules required by the `issuer` via an additional property or option, OR, alternatively, I could envision this as being added through a new rule altogether.\r\n\r\n**Are you willing to work on this yourself?**\r\n\r\nPossibly, if someone can point me in the right direction. I imagine I would need to retrieve the dependency graph of all files require'd by my `issuer` and then extend loader application to any dependencies that fall within the dependency graph. This could be a bit out of my wheelhouse, to be honest. But I'd give it a shot with some help. \r\n","closed_by":{"login":"sokra","id":1365881,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNjU4ODE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1365881?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra","html_url":"https://github.com/sokra","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/webpack/webpack/issues/11466/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/webpack/webpack/issues/11466/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
