It works fine with webpack 4.\r\n\r\nOther imports are fine, only es5-ext is broken, so I theorize this might have something to do with the odd paths of es5-ext which has a folder named `#`.\r\n\r\n<!-- Please ask questions on StackOverflow or the webpack Gitter. -->\r\n<!-- https://stackoverflow.com/questions/ask?tags=webpack -->\r\n<!-- https://gitter.im/webpack/webpack -->\r\n<!-- Issues which contain questions or support requests will be closed. -->\r\n\r\n**What is the current behavior?**\r\nThe generated imports are broken and do not work as expected.\r\n\r\nExample require statement in memoizee that is not working:\r\n```\r\nvar indexOf = require(\"es5-ext/array/#/e-index-of\");\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhat actually gets imported in memoizee is not the expected function from `es5-ext/array/#/e-index-of.js` but the contents of `es5-ext/array/index.js`.\r\n\r\nMy generated js-file includes the following which might explain the problem:\r\n```\r\n/***/ \"./node_modules/es5-ext/array/index.js#/e-index-of\":\r\n/*!*********************************************************!*\\\r\n  !*** ./node_modules/es5-ext/array/index.js#/e-index-of ***!\r\n  \\*********************************************************/\r\n/*! unknown exports (runtime-defined) */\r\n/*! runtime requirements: module, __webpack_require__ */\r\n/*!
