This means major changes and features are done. Major breaking changes have been added. Basic backward-compatibility has been added.\r\n\r\nWe want to use the beta phase to do the following:\r\n\r\n* Let a boarder range of users test the beta version.\r\n* Find bugs in new features.\r\n* Find regressions in old features.\r\n* Find places where a compat-layer can be added to avoid breaking changes.\r\n* Improve the [migration guide](https://github.com/webpack/changelog-v5/blob/master/MIGRATION%20GUIDE.md) and [changelog](https://github.com/webpack/changelog-v5/blob/master/README.md).\r\n\r\nWe want to reach these goals after the beta phase:\r\n\r\n* Old features are very stable\r\n* New features are a bit stable\r\n* Backward-compatibility layer allows most existing plugins/loader to work unmodified (potentially with deprecation warnings)\r\n* There clear way how to migrate from webpack 4 to 5\r\n* There are experimental webpack 5 branches for higher-level tools (like angular-cli, vue-cli, create-react-app, ...) (at least 2)\r\n\r\nTo help with testing you can do the following:\r\n\r\n* Always test with the latest webpack beta version, as problems might already be fixed there\r\n* When using webpack directly:\r\n  * Follow the [migration guide](https://github.com/webpack/changelog-v5/blob/master/MIGRATION%20GUIDE.md)\r\n  * Report or add missing steps in the migration guide\r\n  * Report problems during the migration\r\n  * Report problems with the build after the migration\r\n* When using a higher-level tool:\r\n  * Check if there is a branch/Pull Request for webpack 5\r\n  * Follow guide there\r\n  * Report problems in the Pull Request\r\n* Make sure to also report (positive) experience\r\n  * Performance comparison\r\n  * Size comparison\r\n  * DX comparison\r\n* Try new features\r\n  * Enable persistent caching -> [guide](https://github.com/webpack/changelog-v5/blob/master/guides/persistent-caching.md)\r\n  * Enable Top Level Await\r\n  * Enable the new `asset` module type\r\n  * Enable Long Term Caching\r\n  * Try to break filesystem watching\r\n* Trace back deprecation warnings with `node --trace-deprecation`\r\n  * Help upgrading plugins/loaders\r\n* Make sure to follow beta releases\r\n  * Retest newer version to avoid regressions in beta versions\r\n* Consider sponsoring webpack when this version\r\n  * increases your productivity with better build performance\r\n  * increases your productivity with better developer experience\r\n  * increases your consumer happiness with better application performance\r\n  * make you happy in some other way...\r\n\r\nKnown problems:\r\n\r\n* `eval()` causes problems with the `optimization.innerGraph` (production).\r\n* `libraryTarget: \"module\"` is not implemented yet\r\n* `devtool`s don't support persistent caching yet\r\n* Persistent Cache file include absolute paths are are not portable yet\r\n* `import.meta` is still missing\r\n* prefetching doesn't work for WASM yet\r\n* CLI arguments doesn't contribute to cache version\r\n* ~[stack trace is incorrectly displayed in stats](https://github.com/webpack/webpack/issues/9802#issuecomment-541209889)~\r\n* Build Time is a bit higher for non-cached builds. Possible reasons:\r\n  * tracking extra information in the resolver for safe caching\r\n* [mini-css-extract-plugin is not able to persistent cache yet](https://github.com/webpack/webpack/issues/9802#issuecomment-541303173)\r\n* https://github.com/webpack-contrib/stylelint-webpack-plugin/issues/187\r\n* [svg-sprite-loader doesn't work](https://github.com/webpack/webpack/issues/9802#issuecomment-541468003)\r\n* There is no warning for Buffer or process yet.\r\n\r\nPlanned breaking changes:\r\n\r\n* ~devtool options will be more restrictive~\r\n* Internal HMR API for plugins will probably change\r\n* ~Disable some webpack-only syntax by default: `require.ensure`, `require.include`~\r\n* terser-webpack-plugin will be upgraded\r\n* ~cache.store != \"pack\" will be removed~","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/webpack/webpack/issues/9802/reactions","total_count":390,"+1":148,"-1":0,"laugh":15,"hooray":112,"confused":0,"heart":63,"rocket":41,"eyes":11},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/webpack/webpack/issues/9802/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":2911307140,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDI5MTEzMDcxNDA=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/webpack/webpack/issues/events/2911307140","actor":{"login":"sokra","id":1365881,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNjU4ODE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1365881?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra","html_url":"https://github.com/sokra","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"8e4749e9545439fb67af17d0549b1a4379ec50e0","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/webpack/webpack/commits/8e4749e9545439fb67af17d0549b1a4379ec50e0","created_at":"2019-12-27T20:30:34Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2911308813,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDI5MTEzMDg4MTM=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/webpack/webpack/issues/events/2911308813","actor":{"login":"sokra","id":1365881,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNjU4ODE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1365881?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra","html_url":"https://github.com/sokra","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"4453c9632c5b0ddf963f9b891a62a27e5b30b415","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/webpack/webpack/commits/4453c9632c5b0ddf963f9b891a62a27e5b30b415","created_at":"2019-12-27T20:32:08Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"actor":{"login":"sokra","id":1365881,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNjU4ODE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1365881?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra","html_url":"https://github.com/sokra","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-12-27T20:33:25Z","updated_at":"2019-12-27T20:33:25Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/webpack/webpack/issues/10185","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/webpack/webpack","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/webpack/webpack/issues/10185/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/webpack/webpack/issues/10185/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/webpack/webpack/issues/10185/events","html_url":"https://github.com/webpack/webpack/pull/10185","id":542982802,"node_id":"MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0MzU3MzIyNTA5","number":10185,"title":"make
