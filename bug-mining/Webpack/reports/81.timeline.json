Please don't delete this template because we'll close your issue -->\r\n<!-- Before creating an issue please make sure you are using the latest version of webpack. -->\r\n\r\n# Bug report\r\n\r\n<!-- Please ask questions on StackOverflow or the webpack Gitter. -->\r\n<!-- https://stackoverflow.com/questions/ask?tags=webpack -->\r\n<!-- https://gitter.im/webpack/webpack -->\r\n<!-- Issues which contain questions or support requests will be closed. -->\r\n\r\n**What is the current behavior?**\r\n\r\nIn Webpack 5 a [`target`](https://webpack.js.org/configuration/target/) containing Internet Explorer 11, e.g. `target: 'browserslist:ie 11',`, doesn't build the runtime in ES5.\r\n\r\n**If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce.**\r\n\r\n1. Have a target which includes IE 11, e.g. `target: 'browserslist:ie 11'`\r\n2. Run webpack\r\n3. Try to load your application in IE 11\r\n4. See errors in the console, e.g.\r\n   [SCRIPT1010](https://docs.microsoft.com/de-de/scripting/javascript/misc/expected-identifier-javascript): Expected identifier\r\n    ```\r\n   /******/ \t\t// install a JSONP callback for chunk loading\r\n   /******/ \t\tvar webpackJsonpCallback = function(data) {\r\n   /******/ \t\t\tvar [chunkIds, moreModules, runtime, executeModules] = data; // <- this line\r\n   ```\r\n\r\n<!-- A great way to do this is to provide your configuration via a GitHub repository -->\r\n<!-- The most helpful is a minimal reproduction with instructions on how to reproduce -->\r\n<!-- Repositories with too many files or large `webpack.config.js` files are not suitable -->\r\n<!-- Please only add small code snippets directly into this issue -->\r\n<!-- https://gist.github.com is a good place for longer code snippets -->\r\n<!-- If your issue is caused by a plugin or loader, please create an issue on the loader/plugin repository instead -->\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\n\r\nRuntime is ES5 if IE 11 is present, like `target: ['web', 'es5']` mentioned in https://webpack.js.org/migrate/5/#turn-off-es2015-syntax-in-runtime-code-if-necessary.\r\n\r\n<!-- \"It should work\" is not a helpful explanation -->\r\n<!-- Explain exactly how it should behave -->\r\n\r\n**Other relevant information:**\r\nwebpack version: 5.3.2\r\nNode.js version: 14.7.0\r\nOperating System: Win10 2004\r\nAdditional tools: Powershell\r\n\r\nRelated to #11814 or #11753 maybe?\r\n\r\nThe SCRIPT1010 error above exist when running `mode: 'development',`, in `mode: 'production',` I get [SCRIPT1003](https://docs.microsoft.com/de-de/scripting/javascript/misc/expected-colon): Expected ':' in one of our bundles, so it's probably not even limited to the runtime?\r\n\r\nAs hinted, using `target: ['web', 'es5']` works fine in both cases. `'browserslist:IE >= 10'` like in #11753 works as well.
