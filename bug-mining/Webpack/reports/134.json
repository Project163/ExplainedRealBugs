And it seems to be completely dependent on a slowing hashing function from `webpack-sources`.  It only appears when you have lots of small files, like 3k+.  Here's the last status update by the progress flag:\r\n\r\n` [webpack.Progress] 65% building 4/4 entries 26696/26696 dependencies 6288/6288 modules`\r\n\r\nIt seems to be thrashing memory-wise, as you can see by the second image it's spending 37s in GC.\r\n\r\n**What is the current behavior?**\r\n\r\nIt seems when there is a lot of files, webpack exponentially slowes down.\r\n\r\nSince this project is scala.js I can generate javascript files two different ways\r\n1) With lots of small files\r\n2) With fewest files.\r\n\r\nSo for the first one, here is a chart:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/46037/126198967-8681f0c4-355a-4ed1-aa9e-546cff3de147.png)\r\nAnd the bottoms up view (Heavy methods)\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/46037/126201460-02aff9d5-8e8a-4c1a-97b3-cd1160ab936f.png)\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd for the second one here is another chart, which looks normal.\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/46037/126199052-9cfc9fd4-d612-4124-adc0-5a4c5a218e78.png)\r\n\r\nPractically this is the same code just organized differently.\r\n\r\n**If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce.**\r\n\r\nI'll try to find a way to give some code where it's reproducible, but I have something like 3195 files just in my project not including dependencies in the first option. And 30 files with the second one.\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\n\r\nHave linear performance with regard to the number of files processed by webpack.\r\n\r\n**Other relevant information:**\r\nwebpack version:  5.45.1\r\nNode.js version:  v14.17.0\r\nOperating System: Linux\r\nAdditional tools:\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"sokra","id":1365881,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNjU4ODE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1365881?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra","html_url":"https://github.com/sokra","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/webpack/webpack/issues/13825/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/webpack/webpack/issues/13825/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
