I didn't see anything in https://webpack.js.org/migrate/5/\r\n\r\n**What is the current behavior?**\r\n\r\nIn Webpack v4 I could pass something like `'texp.l': ['./texp', 'l']` to ProvidePlugin, and it'd be treated as either `texp.l()` (input) => `import * as texp from './texp'; texp.l();` (output) or `import {l as texp_l} from './texp'; texp_l();` (output). (Not sure how Webpack handled it under the hood, but it behaved equivalently to one of those.)\r\n\r\n**If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce.**\r\n\r\nSee https://github.com/mwiencek/provideplugin-issue\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\n\r\nPassing `foo.bar` (any property access) as an identifier to the ProvidePlugin should provide/replace that with a reference to the configured module. Similar to the `window.jQuery` example in the docs.\r\n\r\n**Other relevant information:**\r\nwebpack version: 5.0.0-rc.4\r\nNode.js version: v14.10.1\r\nOperating System: macOS 10.15.6\r\nAdditional tools: webpack-cli v4.0.0-rc.1\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"sokra","id":1365881,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNjU4ODE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1365881?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra","html_url":"https://github.com/sokra","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/webpack/webpack/issues/11619/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/webpack/webpack/issues/11619/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
