In https://github.com/mozilla/pdf.js/pull/10170#issuecomment-431697032 we made a build of the viewer with a Webpack version higher than 4.21.0, the last working version. Since 4.22.0 this is broken. In https://github.com/mozilla/pdf.js/pull/10170#issuecomment-431697032 the difference between the output of version 4.21.0 and 4.22.0 is highlighted.
