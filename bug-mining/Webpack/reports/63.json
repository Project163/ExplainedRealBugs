In more recent beta versions there is the following problem from our plugin's perspective:\r\n\r\nThe code for generating script and link preload tags [now lives in separate closures](https://github.com/webpack/webpack/commit/6b9d51061256c39507908216cd33447e1b337b15), which means that if we add the variable containing the map from chunk ID to integrity in one of the templates, it isn't visible from the other.\r\n\r\nI've tried finding a workaround and there are various hacks we could do, but I think the best solution is to add a new hook that would let us inject code into the template around where `var installedChunks` is defined. Unless I'm missing another way of doing this cleanly, would you consider adding a hook like this?\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"sokra","id":1365881,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNjU4ODE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1365881?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra","html_url":"https://github.com/sokra","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/webpack/webpack/issues/10826/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/webpack/webpack/issues/10826/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
