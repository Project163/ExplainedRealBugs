./src/index.js\r\nerror Command failed with exit code 2.\r\n```\r\n\r\nNotice that when you build with the fix the module's build error fails the build, as expected.\r\n\r\n<!-- A great way to do this is to provide your configuration via a GitHub repository -->\r\n<!-- The most helpful is a minimal reproduction with instructions on how to reproduce -->\r\n<!-- Repositories with too many files or large `webpack.config.js` files are not suitable -->\r\n<!-- Please only add small code snippets directly into this issue -->\r\n<!-- https://gist.github.com is a good place for longer code snippets -->\r\n<!-- If your issue is caused by a plugin or loader, please create an issue on the loader/plugin repository instead -->\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\nI would expect the build to fail with the error that occurred while building the `ContextElementDependency`.\r\n\r\nThis code determines how the error should manifest:\r\nhttps://github.com/webpack/webpack/blob/1dc561865ad57d9e862832ccf3579f67a8bbba2d/lib/Compilation.js#L157-L160\r\n\r\nThe `ContextModuleFactory` sets `dep.optional` to `true` for all `ContextElementDependency`s:\r\nhttps://github.com/webpack/webpack/blob/1dc561865ad57d9e862832ccf3579f67a8bbba2d/lib/ContextModuleFactory.js#L144-L146\r\n\r\nI think that `dep.optional` should be set to `false`. I'm happy to PR the change if that makes sense.\r\n\r\n<!-- \"It should work\" is not a helpful explanation -->\r\n<!-- Explain exactly how it should behave -->\r\n\r\n**Other relevant information:**\r\nwebpack version:  4.32.0\r\nNode.js version: v8.9.1\r\nOperating System: macOS 10.12.5\r\nAdditional tools:\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"sokra","id":1365881,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNjU4ODE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1365881?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra","html_url":"https://github.com/sokra","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/webpack/webpack/issues/9161/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/webpack/webpack/issues/9161/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
