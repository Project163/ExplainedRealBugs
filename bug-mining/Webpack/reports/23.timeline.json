IPFS is content-addressed — we refer to an asset on IPFS using the hash of its contents. This means assets can be reused more effectively and ensures its integrity.\r\n\r\nIn the PoC, I created a webpack plugin, `RuntimeJsonpScriptSrcPostProcessorPlugin`, that modifies the generated webpack runtime code like this:\r\n\r\n```diff\r\n-/******/ \t\t\t\tscript.src = jsonpScriptSrc(chunkId);\r\n+/******/ \t\t\t\tscript.src = (function(chunkId) {\r\n+/******/ \t\t\t\t               return AppRuntime.postProcessAssetPath(jsonpScriptSrc(chunkId))\r\n+/******/ \t\t\t\t             })(chunkId);\r\n+/******/\r\n```\r\n\r\nI also created a pitching loader that wraps `file-loader` with an `AppRuntime.postProcessAssetPath` call. After compilation, the `postProcessAssetPath` is generated and injected into the HTML file, which is called at runtime.\r\n\r\nAs you can see, there is a lot of hackery involved in order to pull this off. If webpack supported this runtime post-processing, it will be much easier.","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/webpack/webpack/issues/comments/432378663/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"dtinth","id":193136,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5MzEzNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/193136?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtinth","html_url":"https://github.com/dtinth","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtinth/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtinth/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtinth/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtinth/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtinth/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtinth/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtinth/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtinth/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtinth/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":2007345716,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDIwMDczNDU3MTY=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/webpack/webpack/issues/events/2007345716","actor":{"login":"sokra","id":1365881,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNjU4ODE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1365881?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra","html_url":"https://github.com/sokra","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"36bf6eef39aee21eec4deb88317833081748a312","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/webpack/webpack/commits/36bf6eef39aee21eec4deb88317833081748a312","created_at":"2018-12-05T15:01:03Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"actor":{"login":"sokra","id":1365881,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNjU4ODE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1365881?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra","html_url":"https://github.com/sokra","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-12-05T15:02:59Z","updated_at":"2018-12-05T15:02:59Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/webpack/webpack/issues/8462","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/webpack/webpack","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/webpack/webpack/issues/8462/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/webpack/webpack/issues/8462/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/webpack/webpack/issues/8462/events","html_url":"https://github.com/webpack/webpack/pull/8462","id":387797651,"node_id":"MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0MjM2MjA2NDc0","number":8462,"title":"allow
