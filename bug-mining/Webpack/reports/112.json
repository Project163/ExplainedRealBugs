However, no additional information is printed. When debugging into this I noticed that `compilation.errorsCount` is set to `1`, however `compilation.errors` is an empty array. \r\n\r\nRelevant function:\r\nhttps://github.com/webpack/webpack/blob/7f3f7805b9325f3da05540a37a027823719007ab/lib/stats/DefaultStatsPrinterPlugin.js#L200\r\n\r\nMy wild uneducated guess is that the \"child\" throws an error without a message.\r\n\r\n<!-- Please ask questions on StackOverflow or the webpack Gitter. -->\r\n<!-- https://stackoverflow.com/questions/ask?tags=webpack -->\r\n<!-- https://gitter.im/webpack/webpack -->\r\n<!-- Issues which contain questions or support requests will be closed. -->\r\n\r\n**What is the current behavior?**\r\n\r\nThis is the output I'm facing.
