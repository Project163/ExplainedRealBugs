Run this:\r\n```\r\nnpx create-react-app example --typescript\r\n```\r\n\r\n2. Use this `webpack.config.js` file:\r\n```javascript\r\nconst path = require('path');\r\n\r\nmodule.exports = {\r\n    // change to .tsx if necessary\r\n    entry: './src/App.tsx',\r\n    output: {\r\n        filename: 'bundle.js',\r\n        path: path.resolve(__dirname, 'dist')\r\n    },\r\n    resolve: {\r\n        // changed from extensions: [\".js\", \".jsx\"]\r\n        extensions: ['.ts', '.tsx', '.js', '.jsx']\r\n    },\r\n    module: {\r\n        rules: [\r\n            // changed from { test: /\\.jsx?$/, use: { loader: 'babel-loader' } },\r\n            { test: /\\.(t|j)sx?$/, use: { loader: 'awesome-typescript-loader' } },\r\n            // addition - add source-map support\r\n            { enforce: \"pre\", test: /\\.js$/, loader: \"source-map-loader\" }\r\n        ]\r\n    },\r\n    externals: {\r\n        \"react\": \"React\",\r\n        \"react-dom\": \"ReactDOM\",\r\n    },\r\n    // addition - add source-map support\r\n    devtool: \"source-map\"\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\n\r\nThe error message should mention what loader, if any or not, was used to attempt to load the file. The message does not currently definitively say what is configured.\r\n\r\nIn verbose mode, the `module: { rules: ... }` section should also mention when it's applying a rule to a file that matched a pattern, or when a file didn't match any patterns. Currently the verbose output doesn't print enough information to see what's going on.\r\n\r\n**Other relevant information:**\r\n\r\nwebpack version:  `4.29.6`\r\nNode.js version: `11.13.0`\r\nOperating System: Mac OS 10.14.4\r\nAdditional tools: `awesome-typescript-loader 5.2.1`\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"sokra","id":1365881,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNjU4ODE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1365881?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra","html_url":"https://github.com/sokra","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/webpack/webpack/issues/9025/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/webpack/webpack/issues/9025/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
