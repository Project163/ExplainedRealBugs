                                                \r\n```\r\nI thought initially it was my plugins and loaders, however even after removing everything with minimal configuration to bundle 1 test js file, it just hangs.\r\n\r\nMy `webpack.test.js`:\r\n```\r\nmodule.exports = {\r\n  mode: 'development',\r\n  devtool: 'inline-source-map',\r\n  entry: {\r\n    'tool': './test.js',\r\n  },\r\n

<p>TestingABC</p>\r\n    </div>\r\n  );\r\n};\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\nit should run without being stuck\r\n\r\n**Other relevant information:** (i didn't use any of the packages in the minimal webpack config above but it still hangs)\r\n```\r\n  System:\r\n    OS: macOS 14.6.1\r\n    CPU: (16) arm64 Apple M3 Max\r\n    Memory: 13.45 GB / 64.00 GB\r\n  Binaries:\r\n
