This, in turn, leads to incorrect code being generated by [JsonpChunkLoadingRuntimeModule](https://github.com/webpack/webpack/blob/af52c8f0457b1055098d6b7b545b257404d06c93/lib/web/JsonpChunkLoadingRuntimeModule.js#L144) which, in my case, tries to load a consumed module as if it had been bundled locally, thus making the web server return a `Not found` error and failing the page load.\r\n\r\n**If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce.**\r\n\r\nI cannot send a small test project to reproduce it because:\r\n\r\n1. [My project](https://github.com/liferay/liferay-portal) setup is huge and I'm working in a current development locally.\r\n2. I'm not quite sure how it could be reproduced in a small project because it depends on the dependency graph and federation config.\r\n\r\nAnyway, I'm going to fix this in a following PR with a test, where it is easy to see why the production code was wrong and, looking at the test, what I was expecting to work correctly.\r\n\r\n<!-- A great way to do this is to provide your configuration via a GitHub repository -->\r\n<!-- The most helpful is a minimal reproduction with instructions on how to reproduce -->\r\n<!-- Repositories with too many files or large `webpack.config.js` files are not suitable -->\r\n<!-- Please only add small code snippets directly into this issue -->\r\n<!-- https://gist.github.com is a good place for longer code snippets -->\r\n<!-- If your issue is caused by a plugin or loader, please create an issue on the loader/plugin repository instead -->\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\n\r\nThe expected behavior is that the computed regexp matches the setup correctly (see the unit test in the associated PR).\r\n\r\n<!-- \"It should work\" is not a helpful explanation -->\r\n<!-- Explain exactly how it should behave -->\r\n\r\n**Other relevant information:**\r\nwebpack version:  5.11.0\r\nNode.js version: 12.16.3\r\nOperating System: ArchLinux\r\nAdditional tools: yarn 1.22.4\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"sokra","id":1365881,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNjU4ODE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1365881?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra","html_url":"https://github.com/sokra","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/webpack/webpack/issues/12255/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/webpack/webpack/issues/12255/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
