I managed to fix this behavior by adding additional check if given chunk is an entrypoint, but i am not sure if this is right fix to do, i haven't found original commit for these changes, and it clearly not from the stable version (even tho on github it shows as a part of v4.30 merge to next), in my perspective if this code is only for case when user makes an entrypoint and a cacheGroup with the same name, which is not allowed in v5 already, why not just throw an error earlier not allowing to compile with this configuration, i guess for backward compatibility?\r\n\r\nwebpack version:  v5.0.0-alpha.16\r\nNode.js version: v10.15.3\r\nOperating System: windows 10\r\nAdditional tools: webpack-cli v3.3.4\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"sokra","id":1365881,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNjU4ODE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1365881?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra","html_url":"https://github.com/sokra","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/webpack/webpack/issues/9288/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/webpack/webpack/issues/9288/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
