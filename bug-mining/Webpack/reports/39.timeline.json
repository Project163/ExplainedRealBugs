Fixes `Config.resolve.plugin` call expecting a `webpack.Plugin` type despite those plugins being passed an `enhanced-resolve/lib/Resolver` argument type. (As seen in [this test](https://github.com/webpack/webpack/blob/157c457241bf46b1cb31dbb17e806702eb4a0ec5/test/statsCases/resolve-plugin-context/ResolvePackageFromRootPlugin.js) which uses it as a [resolve plugin](https://github.com/webpack/webpack/blob/157c457241bf46b1cb31dbb17e806702eb4a0ec5/test/statsCases/resolve-plugin-context/webpack.config.js#L10))\r\n\r\n    - All added generics default to `webpack.Plugin` in order to stay fully backwards compatible with previous versions.\r\n\r\n- Allows passing `string` to `Plugin.use()` as those get required by `webpack-chain` [here](https://github.com/neutrinojs/webpack-chain/blob/c59f853e7164f0acac9970c230a35500a1e5cbd3/src/Plugin.js#L50).\r\n\r\n- Allows passing `PluginType` to `Plugin.use()` and `Plugin.init()` as the [default implementation allows it](https://github.com/neutrinojs/webpack-chain/blob/master/src/Plugin.js#L12).\r\n\r\n- Adds tests for the changes.\r\n\r\n    - To make that possible, `@types/enhanced-resolve` and `@types/tapable` were added to `devDependencies` to allow the tests to work.\r\n\r\n    - The `webpack.ResolvePlugin` type currently uses `any` as the `apply()` argument type. The tests use the `Resolver` type to future-proof.\r\n\r\n        - As it turns out the reason is that the DefinitelyTyped `enhanced-resolve` types are a major behind, so the DefinitelyTyped types for `webpack` simply don't reference them. They can't be reused either, as `enhanced-resolve` v3 uses `tapable` v0 while `enhanced-resolve` v4 uses `tapable` v1. See DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped#40804\r\n\r\n        - Meanwhile, the official webpack types are also invalid. I created an issue on the official webpack repo to track that:
