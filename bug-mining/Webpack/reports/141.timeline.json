Behavior\r\n\r\nWhen using watch, the build fails after the first successful build (whenever you change the css).\r\n\r\n````\r\nModule build failed (from ./node_modules/mini-css-extract-plugin/dist/loader.js):\r\nError: waitFor can only be called for an already started item\r\n    at AsyncQueue.waitFor

an issue on the loader/plugin repository instead -->\r\n\r\nWhen upgrading from 2.3.0 to 2.4.0 this issue was introduced for me.\r\n\r\nThis is my webpack config (nothing special I
