With the `concatenateModules` optimization setting on, it incorrectly chooses a shadowed identifier to store module imports.\r\n\r\nIn `ButtonBase.js`, there are two similar identifiers - `_focusVisible` and `focusVisible`:\r\n```javascript\r\n  var _focusVisible = require(\"../utils/focusVisible\");\r\n  // ...\r\n  var _React$useState = _react.default.useState(false),\r\n      focusVisible = _React$useState[0],\r\n      setFocusVisible = _React$useState[1];\r\n\r\n  if (disabled && focusVisible) {\r\n    setFocusVisible(false);\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  var _useIsFocusVisible = (0, _focusVisible.useIsFocusVisible)(),\r\n      isFocusVisible = _useIsFocusVisible.isFocusVisible,\r\n      onBlurVisible = _useIsFocusVisible.onBlurVisible,\r\n      focusVisibleRef = _useIsFocusVisible.ref;\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen this module is concatenated with the `TouchRipple.js` and `Ripple.js` modules which live in the same directory (turning minimize option off so we can analyze the output), I see this in the output:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\n// EXTERNAL MODULE: ./node_modules/@material-ui/core/esm/utils/focusVisible.js\r\nvar focusVisible = __webpack_require__(8310);\r\n// ...\r\n  var _React$useState = react_default().useState(false),\r\n      focusVisible = _React$useState[0],\r\n      setFocusVisible = _React$useState[1];\r\n\r\n  if (disabled && focusVisible) {\r\n    setFocusVisible(false);\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  var _useIsFocusVisible = (0,focusVisible/* useIsFocusVisible */.a)(),\r\n      isFocusVisible = _useIsFocusVisible.isFocusVisible,\r\n      onBlurVisible = _useIsFocusVisible.onBlurVisible,\r\n      focusVisibleRef = _useIsFocusVisible.ref;\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt's using `focusVisible` as the variable to store the module, but that identifier is shadowed in the place where the module is actually used.\r\n\r\nWhen I disable module concatenation, it uses the `_utils_focusVisible__WEBPACK_IMPORTED_MODULE_6__` identifier to store the module, so the conflict does not occur.\r\n\r\n<!-- A great way to do this is to provide your configuration via a GitHub repository -->\r\n<!-- The most helpful is a minimal reproduction with instructions on how to reproduce -->\r\n<!-- Repositories with too many files or large `webpack.config.js` files are not suitable -->\r\n<!-- Please only add small code snippets directly into this issue -->\r\n<!-- https://gist.github.com is a good place for longer code snippets -->\r\n<!-- If your issue is caused by a plugin or loader, please create an issue on the loader/plugin repository instead -->\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\n\r\nThe identifier chosen for the `./node_modules/@material-ui/core/esm/utils/focusVisible.js` external module should not be shadowed at the usage site (ie, the two `focusVisible` variables in the above example should be assigned unique names).\r\n\r\n<!-- \"It should work\" is not a helpful explanation -->\r\n<!-- Explain exactly how it should behave -->\r\n\r\n**Other relevant information:**\r\nwebpack version: webpack@5.0.0-beta.12\r\nNode.js version: v12.14.1\r\nOperating System: macOS 10.14.5\r\nAdditional tools: N/A\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"sokra","id":1365881,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNjU4ODE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1365881?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra","html_url":"https://github.com/sokra","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/webpack/webpack/issues/10308/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/webpack/webpack/issues/10308/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
