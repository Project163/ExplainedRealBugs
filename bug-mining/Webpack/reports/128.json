everything works as expected, however when a HMR build triggers the emitted `hot-update.json` file has a too long name.\r\n\r\n```\r\n[webpack-cli] [Error: ENAMETOOLONG: name too long, open '/Users/rigor789/Code/_tmp/myVueApp/platforms/ios/myVueApp/app/_node_modules_nativescript_webpack_dist_loaders_nativescript-hot-loader_index_js_ruleSet_1_rules_8_use_0_node_modules_babel-loader_lib_index_js_clonedRuleSet-3_0_rules_0_use_0_node_modules_nativescript_webpack_dist_loaders_nativescript-worker-loader_index_js_app_app_js_10_17-67.hot-update.json'] {\r\n  errno: -63,\r\n  code: 'ENAMETOOLONG',\r\n  syscall: 'open',\r\n  path: '/Users/rigor789/Code/_tmp/myVueApp/platforms/ios/myVueApp/app/_node_modules_nativescript_webpack_dist_loaders_nativescript-hot-loader_index_js_ruleSet_1_rules_8_use_0_node_modules_babel-loader_lib_index_js_clonedRuleSet-3_0_rules_0_use_0_node_modules_nativescript_webpack_dist_loaders_nativescript-worker-loader_index_js_app_app_js_10_17-67.hot-update.json'\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nI have tried changing `config.output.otUpdateMainFilename` & `config.output.hotUpdateChunkFilename` however if I remove the `[runtime]` placeholder - the filenames are no longer unique (and webpack warns about this correctly).\r\n\r\n**If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce.**\r\n\r\nTried to reproduce in a simple scenario but that has proven difficult - as it's a combination of multiple plugins & loaders.\r\n\r\n<!-- A great way to do this is to provide your configuration via a GitHub repository -->\r\n<!-- The most helpful is a minimal reproduction with instructions on how to reproduce -->\r\n<!-- Repositories with too many files or large `webpack.config.js` files are not suitable -->\r\n<!-- Please only add small code snippets directly into this issue -->\r\n<!-- https://gist.github.com is a good place for longer code snippets -->\r\n<!-- If your issue is caused by a plugin or loader, please create an issue on the loader/plugin repository instead -->\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\n\r\nThe [HotModuleReplacementPlugin](https://github.com/webpack/webpack/blob/master/lib/HotModuleReplacementPlugin.js) (or anywhere, if there's a better place) should handle too long filenames, and shorten them.\r\n\r\nAdding some logging, the `runtime` is the long part that causes trouble:\r\nhttps://github.com/webpack/webpack/blob/e643b85a6accde7e4c7f19c8770816e5aaf6a945/lib/HotModuleReplacementPlugin.js#L454-L463\r\n\r\nThis seems to be handled for imported chunks already: https://github.com/webpack/webpack/issues/6426\r\n\r\n<!-- \"It should work\" is not a helpful explanation -->\r\n<!-- Explain exactly how it should behave -->\r\n\r\n**Other relevant information:**\r\nwebpack version:  5.25.0\r\nNode.js version: 14.9.0\r\nOperating System: macOS\r\nAdditional tools: N/A\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"sokra","id":1365881,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNjU4ODE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1365881?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra","html_url":"https://github.com/sokra","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/webpack/webpack/issues/12883/reactions","total_count":3,"+1":3,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/webpack/webpack/issues/12883/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
