Please don't delete this template because we'll close your issue -->\r\n<!-- Before creating an issue please make sure you are using the latest version of webpack. -->\r\n\r\n# Bug report\r\n\r\n<!-- Please ask questions on StackOverflow or the webpack Gitter. -->\r\n<!-- https://stackoverflow.com/questions/ask?tags=webpack -->\r\n<!-- https://gitter.im/webpack/webpack -->\r\n<!-- Issues which contain questions or support requests will be closed. -->\r\n\r\n**What is the current behavior?**\r\n\r\nIt seems like that the watcher does not work correctly with inline entries like in the following webpack config:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nmodule.exports = {\r\n  entry: {\r\n    main: \"./src/index.js\",\r\n    inline: \"data:text/javascript,\"\r\n  },\r\n  mode: \"development\",\r\n};\r\n```\r\n\r\nBased on [the findings](https://github.com/jantimon/html-webpack-plugin/issues/1576#issuecomment-752041388) of @pvdstel it marks the inline script to be removed and therefore **triggers a second compilation**.\r\n\r\n**If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce.**\r\n\r\nUse the webpack config above and start the webpack-dev-server locally or open this [codesandbox](https://codesandbox.io/s/webpack-5-double-compilation-b14b9?file=/webpack.config.js:0-631) which shows the following result:\r\n\r\n![webpack_5_double_compilation_-_CodeSandbox](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4113649/103283404-c44bd600-49d8-11eb-98e2-04b34c1f5ff8.png)\r\n\r\nAs you can see `watcher.on(\"initial-missing\"` triggers because webpack watches inline `data:` entries:\r\n\r\n![DevTools_-_Node_js](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4113649/103286075-f3197a80-49df-11eb-8a18-d205ba13720f.png)\r\n\r\n<!-- A great way to do this is to provide your configuration via a GitHub repository -->\r\n<!-- The most helpful is a minimal reproduction with instructions on how to reproduce -->\r\n<!-- Repositories with too many files or large `webpack.config.js` files are not suitable -->\r\n<!-- Please only add small code snippets directly into this issue -->\r\n<!-- https://gist.github.com is a good place for longer code snippets -->\r\n<!-- If your issue is caused by a plugin or loader, please create an issue on the loader/plugin repository instead -->\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\n\r\nThe compilation should only trigger once.\r\n\r\n<!-- \"It should work\" is not a helpful explanation -->\r\n<!-- Explain exactly how it should behave -->\r\n\r\n**Other relevant information:**\r\n\r\nwebpack:
