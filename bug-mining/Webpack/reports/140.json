Either pass a mimetype via \"generator.mimetype\" or use type: \"asset/resource\" to create a resource file instead of a DataUrl\r\n```\r\nI've tracked the input and it is already a Data URL base64, like `data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhCgAKAJECAAAAAP///////wAA…`.\r\n\r\n**If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce.**\r\nThere's no such error without persistent cache, so I belive this to be a bug. I have this on private codebase, but I think the reproduction would be to use data urls in webpack-handled files. One of our flawed assets come from `import 'react-image-crop/dist/ReactCrop.css';` which in turn uses data url in `url()`.\r\n\r\n<!-- A great way to do this is to provide your configuration via a GitHub repository -->\r\n<!-- The most helpful is a minimal reproduction with instructions on how to reproduce -->\r\n<!-- Repositories with too many files or large `webpack.config.js` files are not suitable -->\r\n<!-- Please only add small code snippets directly into this issue -->\r\n<!-- https://gist.github.com is a good place for longer code snippets -->\r\n<!-- If your issue is caused by a plugin or loader, please create an issue on the loader/plugin repository instead -->\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\nNo error in console.\r\n\r\nFor bugged asset [this line](https://github.com/webpack/webpack/blob/200ce66945ef18621199c582575982b37d89ac8d/lib/asset/AssetGenerator.js#L151) got empty string without persistent cache and `{ encoding: undefined, mimetype: undefined }` with persistent cache.\r\n\r\n<!-- \"It should work\" is not a helpful explanation -->\r\n<!-- Explain exactly how it should behave -->\r\n\r\n**Other relevant information:**\r\nwebpack version:  5.52\r\nNode.js version: 14.17\r\nOperating System: GNU/Linux\r\nAdditional tools:\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"sokra","id":1365881,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNjU4ODE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1365881?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra","html_url":"https://github.com/sokra","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/webpack/webpack/issues/14176/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/webpack/webpack/issues/14176/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
