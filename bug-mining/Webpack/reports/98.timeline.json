webpack team:\r\n\r\nMay I ask what is the release policy of the project? We are having some discussions around using a temporary patched webpack version for our project until the new release fixing this issue happens, but we are unsure it is worth the hassle, as it looks you release very often :-). \r\n\r\nHowever, I would like to know if you have a fixed cadence, or do it on demand, or simply when you have time to do it.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance and also thanks for the great work you

making a proposal, have you used the issue search functionality?\r\n\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is your proposal?\r\n\r\nI'm creating this issue to keep reference to [this slack conversation](https://liferay.slack.com/archives/G3JBR21HA/p1609146048470200).\r\n\r\nSometimes we've had the need to patch a third party software (in the case linked above it was `webpack`) but have never found a good solution that we have adopted as a pattern.\r\n\r\nThere's a diff-and-patch mechanism set up in `liferay-portal` as mentioned by Brian in [this PR](https://github.com/brianchandotcom/liferay-portal/pull/97237#issuecomment-751292989), but we shouldn't probably use it because it doesn't adapt well to frontend projects and would require quite a lot of overhead for very small profit.\r\n\r\nSo, in the linked conversation we discussed the pros and cons of:\r\n\r\n1. Creating a fork of webpack and publish it with a different it while we use the patched copy\r\n2. Put that fork inside this monorepo using git submodules or any other mechanism\r\n3. Patch webpack on the go from npm-scripts\r\n4. ...\r\n\r\n\r\n## Why would adopting this proposal be beneficial?\r\n\r\nAdopting a mechanism like this could help in unblocking us in the future when we depend on a third party release. But, on the other hand, we have discarded it for now as webpack releases often and we don't know if a blocking problem will appear in the future.\r\n\r\n[I have asked](https://github.com/webpack/webpack/issues/12255#issuecomment-751647703), however, what is the release policy of webpack.\r\n\r\n## What are the alternatives to this proposal?\r\n\r\nA good alternative could be making a two week long travel to Tibet, for example. That's something I would like more than patching webpack, to mention an example.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/liferay/liferay-frontend-projects/issues/370/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":2,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/liferay/liferay-frontend-projects/issues/370/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/webpack/webpack/issues/comments/751704291","html_url":"https://github.com/webpack/webpack/issues/12255#issuecomment-751704291","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/webpack/webpack/issues/12255","id":751704291,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc1MTcwNDI5MQ==","user":{"login":"alexander-akait","id":4567934,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1Njc5MzQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4567934?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexander-akait","html_url":"https://github.com/alexander-akait","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexander-akait/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexander-akait/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexander-akait/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexander-akait/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexander-akait/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexander-akait/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexander-akait/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexander-akait/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexander-akait/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-12-28T12:59:14Z","updated_at":"2020-12-28T12:59:14Z","body":"Release will be after holidays ","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/webpack/webpack/issues/comments/751704291/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"alexander-akait","id":4567934,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1Njc5MzQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4567934?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexander-akait","html_url":"https://github.com/alexander-akait","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexander-akait/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexander-akait/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexander-akait/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexander-akait/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexander-akait/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexander-akait/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexander-akait/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexander-akait/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexander-akait/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/webpack/webpack/issues/comments/751711637","html_url":"https://github.com/webpack/webpack/issues/12255#issuecomment-751711637","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/webpack/webpack/issues/12255","id":751711637,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc1MTcxMTYzNw==","user":{"login":"izaera","id":3273630,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyNzM2MzA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3273630?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/izaera","html_url":"https://github.com/izaera","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/izaera/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/izaera/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/izaera/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/izaera/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/izaera/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/izaera/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/izaera/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/izaera/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/izaera/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-12-28T13:25:27Z","updated_at":"2020-12-28T13:25:27Z","body":"Perfect, then.
