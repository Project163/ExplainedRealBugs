\r\n\r\n**If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce.**\r\n\r\nI have two entry points with async/sync modules.\r\n\r\n```\r\n// a.js\r\nimport { run } from \"./app/app\";\r\nimport (\"lodash\");\r\nimport \"bootstrap\";\r\nimport \"./main.scss\";\r\nimport { AlertService } from \"./app/alert.service\";\r\nimport { ComponentService } from \"./app/component.service\";\r\nconst alertService = new AlertService();\r\nconst componentService = new ComponentService();\r\nrun(alertService, componentService);\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\n// b.js\r\nimport { run } from \"./app/app\";\r\nimport (\"lodash\");\r\nimport (\"bootstrap\");\r\nimport \"./main.scss\";\r\nimport { AlertService } from \"./app/alert.service\";\r\nimport { ComponentService } from \"./app/component.service\";\r\nconst alertService = new AlertService();\r\nconst componentService = new ComponentService();\r\nrun(alertService, componentService);\r\n```\r\nThe optimization plugin config **without custom minSize** is as follows where everything generated as expected\r\n\r\n```\r\n  optimization: {\r\n    minimize: false,\r\n    splitChunks: {\r\n      chunks: \"initial\",\r\n      // minSize: 520000,\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n```\r\ngenerated chunks with above config\r\n```\r\n4.0430a28c67c95515623d.bundle.js   509 KiB       4
