#385, expanding on #1724 \r\n\r\nUpdating nuxt to a server target went fairly well, although polishing (as always) revealed some quirks of nuxt:\r\n\r\n- The dynamic base path only works when specifying router base `./` at build time\r\n- The dynamic router base path is incompatible with `@nuxt/pwa`, so some [open heart surgery](https://github.com/1nVitr0/audiobookshelf/blob/feature/nuxt-target-server/client/modules/rewritePwaManifest.js) was needed, thugh significantly more robust than the original pull request #1724\r\n- Nuxt inserts all nodes specified in `nuxt.config.js` => `header` **BEFORE** the `<base>` tag containing the router base path. This means, both `Sortable` lib and the `favicon` are not dynamic. I have created plugins for both of them ([sortable](https://github.com/1nVitr0/audiobookshelf/blob/feature/nuxt-target-server/client/plugins/sortable.js), [favicon](https://github.com/1nVitr0/audiobookshelf/blob/feature/nuxt-target-server/client/plugins/favicon.js)), which I'm not very happy about. Especially loading the favicon after the scripts is not ideal.\r\n- The client must be run using `nuxt start`, I have not been able to get the supposed [`--standalone`](https://nuxtjs.org/docs/configuration-glossary/configuration-build/#standalone) mode to work, so the client dependencies are necessary\r\n\r\nIn it's current state, it has been working throughout my local tests. I did run the same tests in the docker image, where for some reason the `icon.svg` as well as the `Sortable.js` lib return 404 errors. Not sure what the issue is here, but I've been staring at this for too long, probably just missing something simple. \r\n\r\nIn case you're wondering about the order changes in the Dockerfilec, this was mainly done for cache efficiency. I had the client dependencies install again every time I fiddled with the `nuxt.config.js`, so I split copying the `package.json` and the rest of the code. Similar deal with the other copy commands, I tried ordering from least to most often changed.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/advplyr/audiobookshelf/issues/1746/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/advplyr/audiobookshelf/issues/1746/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
