Some types of assets (such as CSS files transpiled from SCSS/LESS/etc.) benefit from having source maps, so it doesn't make sense to assume that no asset will ever have a source map.\r\n\r\nFor example, `sass-loader` can be used to produce `.css` asset files from `.scss` source files. (This is in contrast to using something like `css-loader`/`style-loader`...sometimes a large website may need to reference site-wide static styles instead of having a script import them.)\r\n\r\n**What is the current behavior?**\r\n\r\nWebpack assumes all modules with a type starting with `asset/` (such as `asset/resource`) are \"binary\", and discards any source maps returned by loaders for these modules.\r\n\r\nIn my case, `sass-loader` returns source maps generated by the SASS implementation, which `NormalModule.js` retrieves as such: \r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/webpack/webpack/blob/ac8e83a4a2984ed977fd6c23a609da5cb43da492/lib/NormalModule.js#L851-L853\r\n\r\nAt this point, `source` is of type `string` (not `Buffer`), and `sourceMap` is a valid source map object.\r\n\r\nHowever, several lines later, the `source` string gets converted to a `Buffer` because the constructor for `NormalModule` sets `this.binary` to `true` for all asset modules:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/webpack/webpack/blob/ac8e83a4a2984ed977fd6c23a609da5cb43da492/lib/NormalModule.js#L315\r\nhttps://github.com/webpack/webpack/blob/ac8e83a4a2984ed977fd6c23a609da5cb43da492/lib/NormalModule.js#L870-L875\r\n\r\nThis causes `createSource` to ignore the source map passed into it and return a `RawSource` for the buffer:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/webpack/webpack/blob/ac8e83a4a2984ed977fd6c23a609da5cb43da492/lib/NormalModule.js#L782-L796\r\n\r\n**If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce.**\r\n\r\nI can't provide my exact configuration due to proprietary company information, but this is reproducible with any Webpack configuration that uses SASS for asset modules.\r\n\r\n- Set up `sass-loader` in a rule for modules with `type: \"asset/resource\"`. This will need the `sass-loader` and `sass-embedded` packages to be installed.\r\n  ```js\r\n  {\r\n    test: /\\.scss$/i,\r\n    type: \"asset/resource\",\r\n    use: [\r\n      {\r\n        loader: \"sass-loader\",\r\n        options: {\r\n          api: \"modern\",\r\n          sourceMap: true,\r\n          sassOptions: {\r\n            sourceMapIncludeSources: true,\r\n          },\r\n        },\r\n      },\r\n    ],\r\n  }\r\n  ```\r\n- Enable Webpack's source maps, e.g. with `devtool: \"inline-source-map\"`\r\n- Provide a `.scss` file as an entry point\r\n- Run the Webpack compiler\r\n- View the `.css` file in the output directory and observe that it does not contain a source map file adjacent to it, nor does it contain an inline source map comment\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\n\r\nLoaders for Asset Modules should be able to return a source map for certain types of assets, and these source maps should be included just like they would be for JavaScript modules instead of being unconditionally ignored.\r\n\r\nIf I change line 872 in `NormalModule.js` to the following, the source maps from SASS start working as expected:\r\n```js\r\n    (this.binary && !sourceMap) ? asBuffer(source) : asString(source),\r\n```\r\n\r\nObviously this is not suitable as a one-size-fits-all fix; it's a hacky workaround that fixes the problem in my specific situation. Non-text assets (and even many text assets) would not be compatible with source maps (although I wouldn't expect loaders for these asset types to return a source map in the first place).\r\n\r\nPerhaps there needs to be a way to opt into source maps on a per-module-rule basis, possibly in the `generator` settings? \r\n\r\n<!-- \"It should work\" is not a helpful explanation -->\r\n<!-- Explain exactly how it should behave -->\r\n\r\n**Other relevant information:**\r\nwebpack version:  5.91.0\r\nNode.js version: 20.13.1\r\nOperating System: Windows 10 x64 (version 22H2)\r\nAdditional tools:\r\n- `sass-loader = 14.2.1`\r\n- `sass-embedded = 1.77.2`\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"alexander-akait","id":4567934,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1Njc5MzQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4567934?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexander-akait","html_url":"https://github.com/alexander-akait","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexander-akait/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexander-akait/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexander-akait/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexander-akait/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexander-akait/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexander-akait/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexander-akait/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexander-akait/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexander-akait/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/webpack/webpack/issues/18438/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/webpack/webpack/issues/18438/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
