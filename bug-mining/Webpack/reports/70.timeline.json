Please don't delete this template because we'll close your issue -->\r\n<!-- Before creating an issue please make sure you are using the latest version of webpack. -->\r\n\r\n# Bug report\r\n\r\nI have the following code in my project (simplified):\r\n\r\n```js\r\nimport types from '../../../../../../config/types.json';\r\n\r\nfunction getLabel(data) {\r\n  return types.find(\r\n    el => el.type === data.type,\r\n  ).label;\r\n}\r\n\r\nfunction validate({\r\n  response,\r\n  data,\r\n}) {\r\n  const { type } = response;\r\n\r\n  if (type !== formData.type) {\r\n    console.warn(`Type mismatch: '${formData.type}' provided, expected '${type}'.`);\r\n\r\n    const typeLabel = getLabel(data);\r\n\r\n    return `It looks like ${typeLabel} type is wrong.`;\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nwhere imported `types.json` is something like\r\n\r\n```\r\n[\r\n  {\r\n    \"label\": \"Label\",\r\n    \"type\": 1\r\n  }\r\n  {\r\n    \"label\": \"Another label\",\r\n    \"type\": 2\r\n  }\r\n]\r\n```\r\n\r\nand obviously, `validate()` function is ran at some point.\r\n\r\nAfter upgrading from Webpack `5.0.0-beta.29` to `5.0.0-rc.3`, I've noticed that this function started crashing.\r\n\r\nI investigated by updating it step by step and here's my outcome:\r\n\r\n| Version | Works? |\r\n| -- | -- |\r\n| 5.0.0-beta.29 | Yes ✅  |\r\n| 5.0.0-beta.30 | Yes ✅  |\r\n| 5.0.0-beta.31 | No ❌  |\r\n| 5.0.0-rc.0 | No ❌  |\r\n| 5.0.0-rc.3 | No ❌  |\r\n\r\n**What is the current behavior?**\r\n\r\nIn `5.0.0-beta.31`, `5.0.0-rc.0`, `5.0.0-rc.3` it's compiled to (whitespace added for readability):\r\n\r\n```js\r\nif(o!==s.type)\r\n  return console.warn(\"Type mismatch: '\"+s.type+\"' provided, expected '\"+o+\"'.\"), \r\n  \"It looks like \"+function(e){return(void 0)((function(t){return t.type===e.type})).label}(s)+\" type is wrong.\";\r\n```\r\n\r\nwhich causes the following error:\r\n\r\n```\r\nTypeError: (void 0) is not a function\r\n```\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\n\r\nIn `5.0.0-beta.29`, `5.0.0-beta.30`, `if` statement is compiled to (whitespace added for readability):\r\n\r\n```js\r\nif(o!==s.type)\r\n  return console.warn(\"Type mismatch: '\"+s.type+\"' provided, expected '\"+o+\"'.\"), \r\n  \"It looks like \"+function(e){return _.find((function(t){return t.type===e.type})).label}(s)+\" type is wrong.\";\r\n```\r\n\r\nwhich correctly prints\r\n\r\n```\r\nType mismatch: <type> provided, expected <expectedType>.\r\n```\r\n\r\nand correctly returns\r\n\r\n```\r\nIt looks like <type.label> type is wrong.\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Other relevant information:**\r\n\r\nChanging types.json from to `js` (`export default [{…}, {…}]`) makes it all working again.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, changing the code slightly not to do direct operations on array imported from JSON:\r\n\r\n```diff\r\n-import rawTypes from '../../../../../../config/types.json';\r\n+import rawTypes from '../../../../../../config/types.json';\r\n+\r\n+const types = [...rawTypes];\r\n\r\nfunction getLabel(data) {\r\n  const { label } = types.find(\r\n    el => el.type === data.type,\r\n  );\r\n\r\n  return label;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nalso fixes the issue.\r\n\r\nSo my diagnosis is: tree-shaking / or minifying / or module concatenating functionality, starting with 5.0.0-beta.31, stopped correctly recognizing Array.find on arrays imported from JSON files, causing them be \"resolved\" to `void 0`, and consequently, to no longer work.\r\n\r\nwebpack version: 5.0.0-rc.3\r\nNode.js version:
