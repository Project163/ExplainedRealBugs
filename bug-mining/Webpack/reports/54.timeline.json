been experiencing really strange errors in webpack builds.\r\n\r\nSeems like treat webpack plugin sometimes (?) does not return (?) module ID to webpack upon compilation (if I understand the process correctly). \r\n\r\nThe exact error during webpack build is\r\n```\r\n/Users/xxx/projects/yyy/frontm/node_modules/babel-loader/lib/index.js??ref--7-oneOf-2!/Users/xxx/projects/yyy/front/SomeComponent.tsx\r\nRuntimeTemplate.moduleId(): Module /Users/xxx/projects/yyy/frontm/node_modules/treat/webpack-plugin/loader.js??ref--4-0!/Users/xxx/projects/yyy/frontm/node_modules/babel-loader/lib/index.js??ref--7-oneOf-2!/Users/xxx/projects/yyy/front/SomeComponent.treat.ts has no id. This should not happen.\r\n```\r\n\r\nAlso there is another way of failing: webpack build succeeds but there are some ```__webpack_require__(null)``` and this is null is that missing ID (as there are pre-terser comments and it's that exact module). And in this case I get a runtime error.\r\n\r\nBut I believe this is basically the same problem.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, I can't create a small reproducible repo as both these errors seem to vanish when I delete some other code and barebones example has no problems. I'll try to accomplish this but can't guarantee.\r\n\r\nThe most important thing: the very same code outputs different results.\r\nSo sometimes I get `__webpack_require__(null)` instead of treat import, rerun the build without changing anything and got correct module id like `__webpack_require__(53)`.\r\n\r\nSeems like some race condition.\r\n\r\nIt also should be noted that this `treat` module I'm talking about is imported into more than 1 React component. I understand it's not the best way to deal with CSS and goes against CSS best practices but I believe that should work ok in terms of compilation.\r\n\r\nWhile I'm trying to come up with a reproducible repo, could you please guide me into the direction where this error might originate from?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/seek-oss/treat/issues/91/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":1},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/seek-oss/treat/issues/91/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"actor":{"login":"ZYSzys","id":23313266,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMzEzMjY2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/23313266?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZYSzys","html_url":"https://github.com/ZYSzys","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZYSzys/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZYSzys/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZYSzys/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZYSzys/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZYSzys/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZYSzys/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZYSzys/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZYSzys/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZYSzys/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-05-17T17:41:39Z","updated_at":"2020-05-17T17:41:39Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ZYSzys/webpack-hoist-exports/issues/2","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ZYSzys/webpack-hoist-exports","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ZYSzys/webpack-hoist-exports/issues/2/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ZYSzys/webpack-hoist-exports/issues/2/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ZYSzys/webpack-hoist-exports/issues/2/events","html_url":"https://github.com/ZYSzys/webpack-hoist-exports/pull/2","id":619757284,"node_id":"MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0NDE5MTQ1Mzk0","number":2,"title":"fix:
