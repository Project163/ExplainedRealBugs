I looked at the loop that's crashing:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/webpack/webpack/blob/8c8f4c93bb2114606bd20978bf2f0ab961bd391e/lib/util/deterministicGrouping.js#L345-L348\r\n\r\nand changed it a little bit to see what's causing the error:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nwhile (isTooSmall(rightSize, minSize)) {\r\n\tif (group.nodes[right]) {\r\n\t\taddSizeTo(rightSize, group.nodes[right].size);\r\n\t} else {\r\n\t\tthrow new Error(JSON.stringify({\r\n\t\t\tminSize,\r\n\t\t\tmaxSize,\r\n\t\t\trightSize,\r\n\t\t\tright,\r\n\t\t}, null, 2));\r\n\t}\r\n\tright--;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nand sure enough, this is what I got in logs:\r\n\r\n```js\r\n{\r\n  \"minSize\": {\r\n    \"javascript\": 20000,\r\n    \"unknown\": 20000,\r\n    \"css/mini-extract\": 20000\r\n  },\r\n  \"maxSize\": {\r\n    \"javascript\":

-1\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo the issue here is that css/mini-extract rightSize didn't reach minSize and the loop kept looping over group.nodes below index 0.\r\n\r\nA fix as simple as \r\n\r\n```diff\r\n-\t\t\t\twhile (isTooSmall(rightSize, minSize)) {\r\n+ \t\t\t\twhile (right && isTooSmall(rightSize, minSize)) {\r\n```\r\n\r\nfixed the
