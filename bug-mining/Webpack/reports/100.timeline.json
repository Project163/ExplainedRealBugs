`__webpack_modules__` when building with `mode: development`. \r\nThe same code works and the page is loading fine when building with `mode: production` and serving dist.\r\n\r\nIt seems like the dist bundle file is never \"expanded\" in `__webpack_modules__`.\r\nIf you look at the image you'll see that the bundle is an entry in `__webpack_modules__`, but the exported modules from said file is not appearing in the list when checking. The list consists om a bunch of modules from node_modules and the modules from the application using the library.\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5993909/97200424-7edd1380-17b1-11eb-9847-e0d8daae7cdd.png)\r\n\r\nSo when it looks for the module in `__webpack_modules__` it will end up with `undefined`.\r\n```javascript\r\n__webpack_modules__[moduleId].call(module.exports, module, module.exports, __webpack_require__);\r\n```\r\nThat will cause the following error:\r\n```\r\nUncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'call' of undefined\r\n    at __webpack_require__ (main.js:2793)\r\n    at eval (index.ts:30)\r\n    at Object../src/index.ts (index.js:2168)\r\n    at __nested_webpack_require_8364606__ (index.js:5397)\r\n    at eval (index.js:5436)\r\n    at eval (index.js:5437)\r\n    at webpackUniversalModuleDefinition (index.js:11)\r\n    at eval (index.js:18)\r\n    at Object.../web-lib-core/dist/index.js (lib.js:87)\r\n    at __webpack_require__ (main.js:2793)\r\n```\r\nThe module is also missing all exports:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5993909/97201046-42f67e00-17b2-11eb-9b1d-f06b1302d33e.png)\r\n\r\nThe code is present in the dist file (i have removed the contents):\r\n```javascript\r\n/***/ \"./src/metadata/oasbasicmetadataextensions.class.ts\":\r\n/*!**********************************************************!*\\\r\n  !*** ./src/metadata/oasbasicmetadataextensions.class.ts ***!\r\n  \\**********************************************************/\r\n/*! flagged exports */\r\n/*! export OasBasicMetadataTypeExtensionBase [provided] [no usage info] [missing usage info prevents renaming] */\r\n/*! export __esModule [provided] [no usage info] [missing usage info prevents renaming] */\r\n/*! other exports [not provided] [no usage info] */\r\n/*! runtime requirements: __webpack_exports__, __webpack_require__ */\r\n/***/ ((__unused_webpack_module, exports, __webpack_require__) => {\r\n\r\n\"use strict\";\r\neval(\"\\r\\nObject.defineProperty(exports, \\\"__esModule\\\", ({ value: true }));\\r\\nexports.OasBasicMetadataTypeExtensionBase = void 0;\\r\\nvar tslib_1 = __webpack_require__(/*! tslib */ \\\"../../node_modules/tslib/tslib.es6.js\\\");\\r\\nvar utils_1 = __webpack_require__(/*! ../utils */ \\\"./src/utils/index.ts\\\"); var OasBasicMetadataTypeExtensionBase = /** @class */ (function () {\\r\\n    function OasBasicMetadataTypeExtensionBase(type, typeRef) {...}\\r\\nexports.OasBasicMetadataTypeExtensionBase = OasBasicMetadataTypeExtensionBase;//# sourceURL=webpack-internal:///./src/metadata/oasbasicmetadataextensions.class.ts\\n\");\r\n\r\n/***/ })\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Config files:**\r\nhttps://gist.github.com/JonWallsten/69c82a3eb7688cae285f9034a8699f5b\r\n\r\n**If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce.**\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- A great way to do this is to provide your configuration via a GitHub repository -->\r\n<!-- The most helpful is a minimal reproduction with instructions on how to reproduce -->\r\n<!-- Repositories with too many files or large `webpack.config.js` files are not suitable -->\r\n<!-- Please only add small code snippets directly into this issue -->\r\n<!-- https://gist.github.com is a good place for longer code snippets -->\r\n<!-- If your issue is caused by a plugin or loader, please create an issue on the loader/plugin repository instead -->\r\n\r\nI will work on a repro, but we have a large complex monorepo with a lot of sensitive information.

https://github.com/webpack/webpack-dev-server/issues/2484.\r\nPlease correct me if I'm wrong and it's actually a different one (in that case a reproduction without using `webpack-dev-server` would be nice to have).\r\n\r\nIn case it's the same one, what's happening is that adding dev server client entry is implemented in a \"hacky\" way in `webpack-dev-server`.\r\nIt is being prepended to `config.entry` after `webpack.Compiler` is already instantiated.\r\nThat used to work fine for webpack 4 but now is broken.\r\nOn the other hand since `webpack-dev-server` api accepts an instance of `webpack.Compiler` there's no way they could've implemented it differently (except breaking this api and accepting webpack config instead).\r\n","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/webpack/webpack/issues/comments/723176675/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"dmitrysteblyuk","id":19614814,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NjE0ODE0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19614814?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmitrysteblyuk","html_url":"https://github.com/dmitrysteblyuk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmitrysteblyuk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmitrysteblyuk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmitrysteblyuk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmitrysteblyuk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmitrysteblyuk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmitrysteblyuk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmitrysteblyuk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmitrysteblyuk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmitrysteblyuk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/webpack/webpack/issues/comments/723180617","html_url":"https://github.com/webpack/webpack/issues/11277#issuecomment-723180617","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/webpack/webpack/issues/11277","id":723180617,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDcyMzE4MDYxNw==","user":{"login":"alexander-akait","id":4567934,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1Njc5MzQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4567934?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexander-akait","html_url":"https://github.com/alexander-akait","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexander-akait/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexander-akait/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexander-akait/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexander-akait/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexander-akait/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexander-akait/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexander-akait/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexander-akait/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexander-akait/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-11-06T16:43:57Z","updated_at":"2020-11-06T16:43:57Z","body":"@dmitrysteblyuk
