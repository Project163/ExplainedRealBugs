I'm happy to have the help of the webpack team here, with your experience this space and success building a working system. Let's keep discussing this to figure out what semantics should be standardized._\r\n\r\n## Feature request\r\n\r\nThe WebAssembly CG is working on standardizing the integration of WebAssembly modules and ES Modules. The [proposal's semantics](https://github.com/WebAssembly/esm-integration/blob/e098188221887871410616ba1e186740c9d4aa86/proposals/esm-integration/README.md) are very similar to what webpack's experimental WebAssembly support. However, there may be some minor differences. This issue is intended to be an umbrella bug to track the general effort to add tests against the new proposal and semantic changes to match it.\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\n\r\nThat webpack's WebAssembly module support would match the new specification.\r\n\r\n**What is motivation or use case for adding/changing the behavior?**\r\n\r\n- All documentation about wasm and ESM (the spec itself, MDN, other developer resources) could match up with webpack's implementation\r\n- Bring compatibility among bundlers, to make things easier for programmers\r\n- Make native modules and webpack behave the same, in case the same code may be used both with webpack and as a native module\r\n\r\n**How should this be implemented in your opinion?**\r\n\r\nLet's start with tests. Long-term, it'd be best if tests are part of web-platform-tests and imported into webpack; that's a bit of an unsolved problem for now, though, so the initial plan is to develop tests directly against webpack in a PR.\r\n\r\nTest plan:\r\n- Convert the remaining .wasm tests to .wat for easier development\r\n- Exports of globals from Wasm are imported as WebAssembly.Global\r\nobjects, not Numbers (this looks likely to be an existing spec violation)\r\n- Imports of Numbers become only immutable, not mutable, Global objects,\r\nand undergo rounding based on the declared type\r\n- A WebAssembly.Table, Memory or Global instance, or exported Wasm\r\nfunction, exported JS -> Wasm -> JS, comes out with the same identity\r\n- A cycle Wasm <-> JS, with Wasm on top, leads to a TDZ error for\r\nMemory, Global or Table, but hoisted functions work, and Wasm things are\r\nall initialized by the time the JS top-level statement runs\r\n- A cycle JS <-> Wasm, with JS on top, lets Wasm's start function access\r\nMemory, Global, Table and functions, but using Wasm exports too early\r\nleads to TDZ\r\n- Variables imported JS -> Wasm are snapshotted (whether you overwrite a\r\nbare Number or function, or an entire Memory, Global or Table object\r\nwhich isn't replaced when the variable containing it is overwritten)\r\n- Memory, Table and mutable Global can be mutated by JS code that's\r\ncalled out from Wasm code, and the mutations are observed from Wasm\r\n- LinkError results if there is a type mismatch when importing into\r\nWebAssembly (whether it's from JS or Wasm)\r\n- Circular Wasm modules result in an error before any start function\r\nexecutes\r\n- All Wasm modules in the module graph are validated before any start\r\nfunction runs or JS modules are evaluated; failing validation throws a\r\nCompileError\r\n- The same Wasm module can be imported multiple times (both from JS and\r\nWasm) and only one copy of it is made (1 start function evaluation, 1\r\nmemory/table/global identity, etc)\r\n- The name (number) of exported functions, and the enumeration order of\r\nexports overall, matches the JS API specification\r\n- Wasm modules can be imported from an ordinary import inside an inline\r\na JS module and a dynamic import from either a script or a JS module\r\n- Some parts of the semantics will probably be different in webpack and with native ESM; these tests might only be landed in wpt and not in webpack:\r\n    - The return value of import() for a Wasm module is a\r\nmodule namespace exotic object, similar to that of native modules\r\n(WebPack will need to take shortcuts here)\r\n    - The same resource can be used both as a Wasm module as\r\nwell as through instantiateStreaming, and there's no observable\r\ncaching/sharing between these\r\n    - The choice between interpreting as JS and Wasm is\r\nbased on the mimetype and nothing else; many URL types work (blob, data,\r\nserved from SW), CSP is checked appropriately, the modern CORS settings\r\nare used for the fetch, etc.\r\n\r\n**Are you willing to work on this yourself?**\r\n\r\nI plan to start implementing the test plan described above. (I wouldn't mind help here, cc @ms2ger @xtuc) I am not sure when I would have time to implement the changes in webpack; definitely not before the end of this year.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/webpack/webpack/issues/8144/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/webpack/webpack/issues/8144/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/webpack/webpack/issues/comments/427931904","html_url":"https://github.com/webpack/webpack/issues/8145#issuecomment-427931904","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/webpack/webpack/issues/8145","id":427931904,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQyNzkzMTkwNA==","user":{"login":"littledan","id":189835,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4OTgzNQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/189835?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/littledan","html_url":"https://github.com/littledan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/littledan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/littledan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/littledan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/littledan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/littledan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/littledan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/littledan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/littledan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/littledan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-10-08T18:19:24Z","updated_at":"2018-10-08T18:19:24Z","body":"The new WebAssembly.Global semantics don't seem to be implemented in Safari or Edge, and they are only shipped recently in Chrome 69 and Firefox 62. Seems like Node 10.11 uses V8 6.8, which doesn't support WebAssembly.Global, but instead uses the semantics that webpack tests use. I don't think it makes much sense to polyfill WebAssembly.Global during this current transition, but instead to forward through the export that comes from the underlying implementation.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure if there's any particular change we would make in the implementation, maybe just the tests to permit *either* the bare number *or* WebAssembly.Global. I downloaded Node 11 nightly, which uses V8 7.0, and ran the tests that involved using an exported WebAssembly global. Indeed, the tests that failed were the ones checking the actual exported global value, since it changed from a Number to a WebAssembly.Global object, in an apparently spec-compliant way.\r\n\r\nOne test failed due to apparently invalid WebAssembly, which I noted at https://github.com/webpack/webpack/pull/7467/files#r223454525 . Once that's fixed, I'd be happy to upload a PR with updated tests, of this style (taking wasm/imported-global-preserve-ordering as an example):\r\n\r\n```js\r\nit(\"should preserve the ordering of

This\r\nversion of the API is shipped in Chrome 69 and Firefox 62, and is\r\nalso seen in Node 11 nightly builds.\r\n\r\nThis patch updates webpack's tests to permit either the new API or\r\nthe old one, for exports of WebAssembly Globals. One of the affected\r\ntests passes on Node 11 (where it previously failed), and the other\r\nfails for unrelated reasons (possibly related to [2]).\r\n\r\nFixes #8145\r\n\r\n[1] https://webassembly.github.io/spec/js-api/index.html\r\n[2] https://github.com/webpack/webpack/pull/7467/files#r223454525\r\n\r\n<!-- Thanks for submitting a pull request!

needs to be documented once your changes are merged?**\r\n\r\nWe could document that exported globals from WebAssembly become WebAssembly.Global objects, but I think the right place to document that will be in the WebAssembly/ESM specification; webpack should point to that when it's ready.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/webpack/webpack/issues/8158/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/webpack/webpack/issues/8158/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":1892145162,"node_id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDE4OTIxNDUxNjI=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/webpack/webpack/issues/events/1892145162","actor":{"login":"sokra","id":1365881,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNjU4ODE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1365881?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra","html_url":"https://github.com/sokra","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-10-09T08:29:32Z","label":{"name":"Web
