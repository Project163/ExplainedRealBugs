It's caused by the `sideEffects` optimization, when combined with `DllPlugin` with `entryOnly: false`. The `sideEffects` optimization skips some modules from the graph because they are unused. These modules are not included in the file. Later in the process the DllPlugin flags all exports from all modules as used, which causes the skipped modules to be referenced again.\r\n\r\nYou can workaround it by using the `entryOnly` option for the `DllPlugin`, which makes only the module specified in the `entry` option accessible by the app bundle. This way `usedExports` and `sideEffects` can still run on the dependency graph of these modules. This is a functional difference, but should result in smaller vendor bundles.\r\n\r\nOr you can disable `usedExports` in the vendor build. This would be functional the same as your original code, but do not yield the bug.","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/webpack/webpack/issues/comments/569658499/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"sokra","id":1365881,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNjU4ODE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1365881?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra","html_url":"https://github.com/sokra","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":2918182850,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDI5MTgxODI4NTA=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/webpack/webpack/issues/events/2918182850","actor":{"login":"sokra","id":1365881,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNjU4ODE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1365881?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra","html_url":"https://github.com/sokra","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"96620a4651a297885854956d4f1b67bb631d0079","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/webpack/webpack/commits/96620a4651a297885854956d4f1b67bb631d0079","created_at":"2020-01-02T16:38:17Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"actor":{"login":"sokra","id":1365881,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNjU4ODE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1365881?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra","html_url":"https://github.com/sokra","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-01-02T16:39:24Z","updated_at":"2020-01-02T16:39:24Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/webpack/webpack/issues/10205","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/webpack/webpack","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/webpack/webpack/issues/10205/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/webpack/webpack/issues/10205/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/webpack/webpack/issues/10205/events","html_url":"https://github.com/webpack/webpack/pull/10205","id":544653294,"node_id":"MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0MzU4NzE5MDcw","number":10205,"title":"flag
