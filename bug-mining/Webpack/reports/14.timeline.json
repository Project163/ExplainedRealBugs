version of Next.js are you using?**\r\n\r\n10.0.7 (Issue looks like it was introduced in 10.0.6)\r\n\r\n**What version of Node.js are you using?**\r\n\r\n15\r\n\r\n**What browser are you using?**\r\n\r\nChrome\r\n\r\n**What operating system are you using?**\r\n\r\nMacOS\r\n\r\n**How are you deploying your application?**\r\n\r\nnext start\r\n\r\n**Describe the Bug**\r\n\r\nUpdating to  Webpack 5.21.2 alongside Next 10.0.6 causes ModuleNotFound errors when using ignorePlugin.\r\nWe don't get the error when rolling back to 10.0.5\r\n\r\nWhen building in development `next` we have no issues with our pages.\r\nhowever when running `next build` we get an error:\r\n```\r\ninfo  - Creating an optimized production build  \r\nFailed to compile.\r\n\r\nModuleNotFoundError: Module not found: TypeError: Cannot read property 'request' of null\r\n\r\n\r\n> Build error occurred\r\nError: > Build failed because of webpack errors\r\n    at

home/project/node_modules/next/dist/build/tracer.js:1:1596\r\n``` \r\n\r\n#### Issue 1: underlying error was eaten\r\nThe above wasn't very helpful as it doesn't tell me what caused it or what was trying to be loaded.\r\nI managed to search for the `ModuleNotFoundError` class and log out the error before it.\r\nIt was in `/node_modules/next/dist/compiled/webpack/bundle4.js`\r\n\r\nNow i can see:\r\n```\r\nnull\r\nTypeError: Cannot read property 'request' of null\r\n    at IgnorePlugin.checkIgnore (/home/project/node_modules/webpack/lib/IgnorePlugin.js:50:49)\r\n    at

(/home/project/node_modules/next/dist/compiled/webpack/bundle4.js:93245:5)\r\n    at processTicksAndRejections (node:internal/process/task_queues:75:11)\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Issue 2:  null being passed to webpack/ignorePlugin\r\nIt looks like in production next passes `null` to ignorePlugin, specifically [here](https://github.com/webpack/webpack/blob/master/lib/IgnorePlugin.js#L37-L41).\r\nIm not sure why this only happens on production builds but it seems to have only happened since updating to webpack 5\r\n\r\n**Expected Behavior**\r\n\r\nproduction builds should work\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\n\r\n- Clone https://github.com/jasonwilliams/nextjs9-typescript-server-vscode-example\r\n- Checkout `moduleNotFound` branch\r\n- yarn install\r\n- Run next build or `yarn next build` (fails)\r\n- install next \"10.0.5\"\r\n- Run next build - (works, or at least you get a different error)\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js/issues/22200/reactions","total_count":3,"+1":3,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/next.js/issues/22200/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
