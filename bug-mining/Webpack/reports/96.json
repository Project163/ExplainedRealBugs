This will lead to a race-condition and corrupted files on case-insensitive file systems.”\r\n\r\nThis seems to be because `font-awesome.css` references the same file with two different query strings: `url('../fonts/fontawesome-webfont.eot?v=4.7.0')` and `url('../fonts/fontawesome-webfont.eot?#iefix&v=4.7.0')`.\r\n\r\n**If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce.**\r\n\r\n<!-- A great way to do this is to provide your configuration via a GitHub repository -->\r\n<!-- The most helpful is a minimal reproduction with instructions on how to reproduce -->\r\n<!-- Repositories with too many files or large `webpack.config.js` files are not suitable -->\r\n<!-- Please only add small code snippets directly into this issue -->\r\n<!-- https://gist.github.com is a good place for longer code snippets -->\r\n<!-- If your issue is caused by a plugin or loader, please create an issue on the loader/plugin repository instead -->\r\n\r\n```console\r\n$ cat > webpack.config.js <<EOF\r\n// webpack.config.js\r\nmodule.exports = {\r\n  entry: \"font-awesome/css/font-awesome.css\",\r\n  output: { publicPath: \"\" },\r\n  module: {\r\n    rules: [\r\n      { test: /\\.css$/, use: [\"style-loader\", \"css-loader\"] },\r\n      { test: /\\.(eot|svg|ttf|woff2?)$/, type: \"asset/resource\" },\r\n    ],\r\n  },\r\n};\r\nEOF\r\n$ npm i css-loader font-awesome style-loader webpack webpack-cli\r\n…\r\n+ style-loader@2.0.0\r\n+ font-awesome@4.7.0\r\n+ webpack-cli@4.1.0\r\n+ css-loader@5.0.0\r\n+ webpack@5.3.2\r\nadded 163 packages from 175 contributors and audited 163 packages in 4.752s\r\n…\r\n$ npx webpack\r\n[webpack-cli] Error: Prevent writing to file that only differs in casing or query string from already written file.\r\nThis will lead to a race-condition and corrupted files on case-insensitive file systems.\r\n/tmp/test/dist/cf88812dc8f4d812c0ef.eot\r\n/tmp/test/dist/cf88812dc8f4d812c0ef.eot\r\n    at writeOut (/tmp/test/node_modules/webpack/lib/Compiler.js:565:20)\r\n    at /tmp/test/node_modules/webpack/lib/Compiler.js:748:7\r\n    at arrayIterator (/tmp/test/node_modules/neo-async/async.js:3467:9)\r\n    at timesSync (/tmp/test/node_modules/neo-async/async.js:2297:7)\r\n    at Object.eachLimit (/tmp/test/node_modules/neo-async/async.js:3463:5)\r\n    at emitFiles (/tmp/test/node_modules/webpack/lib/Compiler.js:534:13)\r\n    at /tmp/test/node_modules/webpack/lib/util/fs.js:178:5\r\n    at FSReqCallback.oncomplete (fs.js:171:23)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis can also be reproduced without css-loader, using a JS entry point like\r\n\r\n```js\r\nrequire(\"font-awesome/fonts/fontawesome-webfont.eot?v=1\");\r\nrequire(\"font-awesome/fonts/fontawesome-webfont.eot?v=2\");\r\n```\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\n\r\n<!-- \"It should work\" is not a helpful explanation -->\r\n<!-- Explain exactly how it should behave -->\r\n\r\nReferencing a file with different query strings should not cause it to be written twice—it’s the same file, not a collision between two files.\r\n\r\n**Other relevant information:**\r\nwebpack version: 5.3.2\r\nNode.js version: 14.14.0\r\nOperating System: Linux (NixOS 21.03)\r\nAdditional tools: css-loader 5.0.0, font-awesome 4.7.0\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"sokra","id":1365881,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNjU4ODE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1365881?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra","html_url":"https://github.com/sokra","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sokra/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/webpack/webpack/issues/11894/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/webpack/webpack/issues/11894/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
