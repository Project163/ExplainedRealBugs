This allows developers to use the `output.hashSalt` property to force all emitted webpack assets to have new hashes, even though the content has not changed, for example to deliberately cache break a CDN.\r\n\r\nNote that if the `optimization.realContentHash` property was set to `false`, the value of `[contenthash]` already included `output.hashSalt` in the calculation.\r\n\r\n<!-- Thanks for submitting a pull request! Please provide enough information so that others can review your pull request. -->\r\n<!-- Explain the **motivation** for making this change. What existing problem does the pull request solve? -->\r\n<!-- Try to link to an open issue for more information. -->\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- In addition to that please answer these questions: -->\r\n\r\n**What kind of change does this PR introduce?**\r\nFix #16788\r\n\r\n<!-- E.g. a bugfix, feature, refactoring, build related change, etc… -->\r\n\r\n**Did you add tests for your changes?**\r\nYes. Changes verify that running three configs with identical source files and two different values of `output.hashSalt` produce exactly 2 unique output hashes.\r\n\r\n<!-- Note that we won't merge your changes if you don't add tests -->\r\n\r\n**Does this PR introduce a breaking change?**\r\nThis could be considered a breaking change if a consumer is using the `output.hashSalt` property and depending on the value of `[contenthash]` not changing when `optimization.realContentHash` is set.\r\n\r\nPlugins that provide a custom implementation of the content hash (e.g. for Sub-Resource Integrity) will not be impacted, because this change only applies when the `RealContentHashPlugin` is the entity that generates the content hash.\r\n\r\n<!-- If this PR introduces a breaking change, please describe the impact and a migration path for existing applications. -->\r\n\r\n**What needs to be documented once your changes are merged?**\r\nDocumentation of `optimization.realContentHash` should be updated to explicitly call out that it does include `output.hashSalt` if set. The current state of the documentation is unclear on whether or not it is expected.\r\n\r\n<!-- List all the information that needs to be added to the documentation after merge -->\r\n<!-- When your changes are merged you will be asked to contribute this to the documentation -->\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/webpack/webpack/issues/16789/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/webpack/webpack/issues/16789/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":8691714553,"node_id":"REFE_lADOADgiC85gN4L8zwAAAAIGEQn5","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/webpack/webpack/issues/events/8691714553","actor":{"login":"dmichon-msft","id":26827560,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2ODI3NTYw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26827560?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmichon-msft","html_url":"https://github.com/dmichon-msft","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmichon-msft/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmichon-msft/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmichon-msft/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmichon-msft/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmichon-msft/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmichon-msft/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmichon-msft/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmichon-msft/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmichon-msft/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"63e2f42b9ee6d1e0da0899cf908bfbea8f916899","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dmichon-msft/webpack/commits/63e2f42b9ee6d1e0da0899cf908bfbea8f916899","created_at":"2023-03-08T00:14:35Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":8691719669,"node_id":"REFE_lADOADgiC85gN4L8zwAAAAIGER31","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/webpack/webpack/issues/events/8691719669","actor":{"login":"dmichon-msft","id":26827560,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2ODI3NTYw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26827560?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmichon-msft","html_url":"https://github.com/dmichon-msft","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmichon-msft/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmichon-msft/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmichon-msft/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmichon-msft/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmichon-msft/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmichon-msft/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmichon-msft/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmichon-msft/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dmichon-msft/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"07283fabc43a440db046037f7231ee362f31a21c","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dmichon-msft/webpack/commits/07283fabc43a440db046037f7231ee362f31a21c","created_at":"2023-03-08T00:15:43Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":8699587160,"node_id":"CE_lADOADgiC85gN4L8zwAAAAIGiSpY","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/webpack/webpack/issues/events/8699587160","actor":{"login":"TheLarkInn","id":3408176,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MDgxNzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3408176?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/TheLarkInn","html_url":"https://github.com/TheLarkInn","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TheLarkInn/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TheLarkInn/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TheLarkInn/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TheLarkInn/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TheLarkInn/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TheLarkInn/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TheLarkInn/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TheLarkInn/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TheLarkInn/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2023-03-08T18:59:02Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
