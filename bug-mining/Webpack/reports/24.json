option in `config.module.rule[]` , because it can be work with  `include` option.\r\n\r\n**If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce.**\r\n\r\n```js\r\n// webpack.config.js\r\nmodule.exports = {\r\n  resolve: {\r\n    alias: {\r\n      abc: 'efg'\r\n    }\r\n  },\r\n  module: {\r\n    rules: [\r\n      {\r\n        // use `resolve` in config.module.rule[], then it works.\r\n        include: '/path/to/src',\r\n        resolve: {\r\n          alias: {\r\n            '@': '/path/to/src'\r\n          }\r\n        }\r\n      }\r\n    ]\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n<!-- A great way to do this is to provide your configuration via a GitHub repository -->\r\n<!-- The most helpful is a minimal reproduction with instructions on how to reproduce -->\r\n<!-- Repositories with too many files or large `webpack.config.js` files are not suitable -->\r\n<!-- Please only add small code snippets directly into this issue -->\r\n<!-- https://gist.github.com is a good place for longer code snippets -->\r\n<!-- If your issue is caused by a plugin or loader, please create an issue on the loader/plugin repository instead -->\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\n\r\nalias `@` work perfectly. but alias `abc` not work in `./src/xxxx.js`.\r\n\r\nBecause `config.module.rule[].resolve` didn't merge with `config.resolve`.\r\n\r\nUnless: \r\n```js\r\nmodule.exports = {\r\n  resolve: {\r\n    alias: {\r\n      abc: 'efg'\r\n    }\r\n  },\r\n  module: {\r\n    rules: [\r\n      {\r\n        include: '/path/to/src',\r\n        resolve: {\r\n          alias: {\r\n            '@': '/path/to/src',\r\n\t\t\tabc: 'efg'\r\n          }\r\n        }\r\n      }\r\n    ]\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n<!-- \"It
