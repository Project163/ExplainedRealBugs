Please don't delete this template because we'll close your issue -->\r\n<!-- Before creating an issue please make sure you are using the latest version of webpack. -->\r\n\r\n# Bug report\r\n\r\n<!--

used actually.\r\n\r\n**If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce.**\r\n\r\n[reproduction link](https://codesandbox.io/s/ecstatic-meitner-c0ri4?file=/dist/main.f7047f33.js)\r\n\r\ndirectly scroll down to the very bottom of the output file, you would see:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nconsole.log(createTheme_createTheme({}));\r\nconsole.log(/* unused export */ undefined({}));\r\n```\r\nand the corresponding input is:\r\n```ts\r\n// '@fluentui/react' reexports `createTheme` from '@fluentui/styling', who reexports it from '@fluentui/theme as well'.\r\nimport { createTheme as wrongCreateTheme } from \"@fluentui/react\";\r\nimport { createTheme as correctCreateTheme } from \"@fluentui/theme\";\r\n\r\nconsole.log(correctCreateTheme({}));\r\nconsole.log(wrongCreateTheme({}));\r\n```\r\n\r\n<!-- A great way to do this is to provide your configuration via a GitHub repository -->\r\n<!-- The most helpful is a minimal reproduction with instructions on how to reproduce -->\r\n<!-- Repositories with too many files or large `webpack.config.js` files are not suitable -->\r\n<!-- Please only add small code snippets directly into this issue -->\r\n<!-- https://gist.github.com is a good place for longer code snippets -->\r\n<!-- If your issue is caused by a plugin or loader, please create an issue on the loader/plugin repository instead -->\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\nDo not take reexports wrong.\r\n\r\n<!-- \"It should work\" is not a helpful explanation -->\r\n<!-- Explain exactly how it should behave -->\r\n\r\n**Other relevant information:**\r\nwebpack version:  5.0.0\r\nNode.js
