sorry, just adding that overrides the whole list of allowed addresses, you need something like:\r\n`-config api.addrs.addr(0).name=0:0:0:0:0:0:0:1 -config api.addrs.addr(1).name=zap -config api.addrs.addr(2).name=localhost -config api.addrs.addr(3).name=127.0.0.1`\r\n\r\nWe need to update that FAQ entry to refer to
