explained in #2722 and #1853, it was not possible to start an active scan in a context via the API without specifying an URL. This issue clearly seems to be fixed, since the following API call starts an active scan in my preferred context:\r\nhttp://localhost:8080/JSON/ascan/action/scan?apikey=****&recurse=true&contextId=1\r\n\r\nUsing the equivalent API call for scanAsUser (with HTTP/NTLM authentication)\r\nhttp://localhost:8080/JSON/ascan/action/scanAsUser?apikey=****&recurse=true&contextId=1&userId=11\r\nresults in the API output `{\"code\":\"internal_error\",\"message\":\"Internal Error\"}` and zap.log file with the following content:\r\n```\r\nnet.sf.json.JSONException: JSONObject[\"url\"] not found.\r\n\tat net.sf.json.JSONObject.getString(JSONObject.java:2092)\r\n\tat org.zaproxy.zap.extension.ascan.ActiveScanAPI.handleApiAction(ActiveScanAPI.java:249)\r\n\tat org.zaproxy.zap.extension.api.API.handleApiRequest(API.java:431)\r\n\tat org.parosproxy.paros.core.proxy.ProxyThread.processHttp(ProxyThread.java:456)\r\n\tat org.parosproxy.paros.core.proxy.ProxyThread.run(ProxyThread.java:317)\r\n\tat java.lang.Thread.run(Thread.java:748)\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever adding the parameter \"url\" with a valid URL as value works as expected - starting an active scan in my preferred context using my specified HTTP authentication user credentials.\r\n\r\nI guess the problem (#2722) has only been fixed for non-authenticated scans.\r\n\r\nI would like the scan to behave exactly as when starting it via the GUI and selecting a context as \"starting point\". When using no authentication (or using the spider) this can be done by not specifying the \"url\" parameter.\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zaproxy/zaproxy/issues/5021/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zaproxy/zaproxy/issues/5021/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":2759684212,"node_id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDI3NTk2ODQyMTI=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zaproxy/zaproxy/issues/events/2759684212","actor":{"login":"kingthorin","id":7570458,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc1NzA0NTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7570458?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kingthorin","html_url":"https://github.com/kingthorin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kingthorin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kingthorin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kingthorin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kingthorin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kingthorin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kingthorin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kingthorin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kingthorin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kingthorin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-10-31T12:56:55Z","label":{"name":"historic","color":"c2e0c6"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zaproxy/zaproxy/issues/comments/580999239","html_url":"https://github.com/zaproxy/zaproxy/issues/1853#issuecomment-580999239","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zaproxy/zaproxy/issues/1853","id":580999239,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU4MDk5OTIzOQ==","user":{"login":"lock[bot]","id":33595554,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90MzM1OTU1NTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/6672?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lock%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/lock","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lock%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lock%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lock%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lock%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lock%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lock%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lock%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lock%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lock%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-02-01T06:18:32Z","updated_at":"2020-02-01T06:18:32Z","body":"This thread has been automatically locked since there has not been any recent activity after it was closed.
