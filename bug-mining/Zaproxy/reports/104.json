Start ZAP;\n2. Create a new session several times (>= 5 to be easier to spot the issue);\n3. Create a heap dump, analyse it (for example, using Java VisualVM) and note that the instance variable `listenerList` of `ParosDatabase` has many instances of `ClientTable`, `MessageTable` and `TableWebSocket`, one per session opened (the exact types depend on the installed add-ons);\n4. The more sessions are created the more items the `listenerList` has (and the more memory is used by `ParosDatabase`).\n\nZAP:\nVersions >= 2.4.0\n","closed_by":{"login":"psiinon","id":1081115,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwODExMTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1081115?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/psiinon","html_url":"https://github.com/psiinon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psiinon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psiinon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psiinon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psiinon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psiinon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psiinon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psiinon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psiinon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psiinon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zaproxy/zaproxy/issues/2428/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zaproxy/zaproxy/issues/2428/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
