Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.\n\nIf you are running in a CI system, you generally want a tightly controlled environment.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, you want to be able to set items as defaults for any ZAP instance. The simplest way to do this is via environment variables.\r\n\r\n\n\n### Describe the solution you'd like\n\nI would like to be able to set `ZAP_OFFLINE=true` and have all 'reach out' options disabled.\r\n\r\nI believe that this would be equivalent to setting `-silent` and `-notel` at the command line.\n\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\n\nThe only centralized alternative that would work is to pull from another repository and/or set an environment variable with the exact command line options.\r\n\r\nThe drawback to this is that it is just as much work as having users set the option directly and is not able to be driven centrally.\n\n### Screenshots\n\n_No response_\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_\n\n### Would you like to help fix this issue?\n\n- [ ] Yes","closed_by":{"login":"ricekot","id":16446369,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NDQ2MzY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16446369?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ricekot","html_url":"https://github.com/ricekot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ricekot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ricekot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ricekot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ricekot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ricekot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ricekot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ricekot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ricekot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ricekot/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zaproxy/zaproxy/issues/7581/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zaproxy/zaproxy/issues/7581/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
