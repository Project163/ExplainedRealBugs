Describe the bug:\n\nWe are using 2 API's in order to extract Alerts from ZAP via zap clientapi in JAVA\n\n- org.zaproxy.clientapi.gen.Alert#alertsSummary\n- org.zaproxy.clientapi.gen.Alert#alerts\n\nWe're also setting alert filters using the following API:\n\n- org.zaproxy.clientapi.gen.AlertFilter#addAlertFilter\n\nUp till ZAP v. 2.15.0 the alerts filtered ( with 'newlevel' set as FALSE_POSITIVE ) were filtered from output of 'alertsSummary' & 'alerts' API's. \n\nWith ZAP v.2.16.0 the alerts are counted under summary under initial risk i.e. 'High'\nFunnily enough they are not present on the reports.\n\n### Steps to reproduce the behavior:\n\n1. Apply Alert filter to modify Confidence to 'False Positive'\n2. Start Active Scan with of an App where a **High** Alert will be generated. \n3. Call the **org.zaproxy.clientapi.gen.Alert#alertsSummary** API\n4. The API provides a response with _{\"alertsSummary\":{\"High\":1,\"Low\":0,\"Medium\":0,\"Informational\":0}}_\n\n### Expected behavior:\n\nThe API provides a response with _{\"alertsSummary\":{\"High\":0,\"Low\":0,\"Medium\":0,\"Informational\":0}}_\n\n### Software versions:\n\n{\"version\":\"2.16.0\"}\n\n### Screenshots:\n\n_No response_\n\n### Errors from the zap.log file:\n\n_No response_\n\n### Additional context:\n\n_No response_\n\n### Would you like to help fix this issue?\n\n- [ ] Yes","closed_by":{"login":"kingthorin","id":7570458,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc1NzA0NTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7570458?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kingthorin","html_url":"https://github.com/kingthorin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kingthorin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kingthorin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kingthorin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kingthorin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kingthorin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kingthorin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kingthorin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kingthorin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kingthorin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zaproxy/zaproxy/issues/8888/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zaproxy/zaproxy/issues/8888/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
