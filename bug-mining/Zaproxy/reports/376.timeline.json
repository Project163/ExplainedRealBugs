similar.\r\nthe way how we did the scan was sending the traffic through the proxy during the automated testing.\r\nthe total number of pending pscan was around 50k when automated testing was finished.\r\nthe bundle js file size was around 4.5mb\r\n\r\nso the issue was the scanner repeatedly scan the identical bundle file and it took over 1min each
