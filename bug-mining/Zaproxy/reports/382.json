Describe the bug\n\nWhen in the \"Alerts\" tab, having a list of alerts on the left, pressing one of the alerts will open one of the requests that have the issue. \r\nIf I just want to read information about this kind of issue, being redirected automatically (and randomly) to one of the requests just makes me go again to the \"Alerts\" tab and press again. Feels to me like a bug. Going to a request should be triggered only by pressing the specific request.\n\n### Steps to reproduce the behavior\n\n1. Go to \"Alerts\". (Having several kinds of alerts, with multiple requests in each of them).\r\n2. While collapsed, press on one of the alerts.\r\n3. Notice how you are redirected to a request instead of the alert description.\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nOn the \"Alerts\" tab, I would like to be able to press the different alerts and read their descriptions. \r\nCurrently I'm redirected to the \"Request&Response\" tab after each click, having to go back to the \"Alerts\" tab. \n\n### Software versions\n\nZap 2.12.0\n\n### Screenshots\n\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/93528246/198878580-74a4b294-4098-4cf8-9b8a-0d2c7a278c1d.png)\r\n\r\nPressing where I drew the red dots redirects me to the \"Request&Response\" tab.\n\n### Errors from the zap.log file\n\n_No response_\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_\n\n### Would you like to help fix this issue?\n\n- [ ] Yes","closed_by":{"login":"psiinon","id":1081115,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwODExMTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1081115?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/psiinon","html_url":"https://github.com/psiinon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psiinon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psiinon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psiinon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psiinon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psiinon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psiinon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psiinon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psiinon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psiinon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zaproxy/zaproxy/issues/7559/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zaproxy/zaproxy/issues/7559/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
