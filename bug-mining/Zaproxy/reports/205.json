am using ZAProxy in the latest version of Kali Linux with all updated packages. I browse a few sites using the proxy and then on the sites menu I add a site to the default context (https://ad.turn.com.* for example). Finally I select to \"Show only URLS in Scope\" but it does just nothing. I still see the every URL and the site list. I tried to renew the ZAProxy profile by deleting the /root/.ZAP folder, refreshing the site tree. I also double checked the Context to be in Scope.\r\nWhat might be going wrong here?\r\nRegards.","closed_by":{"login":"psiinon","id":1081115,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwODExMTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1081115?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/psiinon","html_url":"https://github.com/psiinon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psiinon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psiinon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psiinon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psiinon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psiinon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psiinon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psiinon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psiinon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psiinon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zaproxy/zaproxy/issues/3675/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zaproxy/zaproxy/issues/3675/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
