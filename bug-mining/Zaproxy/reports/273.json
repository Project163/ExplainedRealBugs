HTML 5 syntax in POST forms is not understandable for the ZAP Spider.\r\n\r\nThe BodgeIt store, for example, uses oldschool form HTML and this works with ZAP:\r\n\r\n```\r\n<form method=\"POST\">\r\n                <center>\r\n                <table>\r\n                <tr>\r\n                               <td>Username (your email address):</td>\r\n                               <td><input id=\"username\" name=\"username\"></input></td>\r\n                </tr>\r\n                <tr>\r\n                               <td>Password:</td>\r\n                               <td><input id=\"password1\" name=\"password1\" type=\"password\"></input></td>\r\n                </tr>\r\n                <tr>\r\n                               <td></td>\r\n                               <td><input id=\"submit\" type=\"submit\" value=\"Register\"></input></td>\r\n                </tr>\r\n                </table>\r\n                </center>\r\n <center>\r\n                <table>\r\n                <tr>\r\n                               <td>Username (your email address):</td>\r\n                               <td><input id=\"username\" name=\"username\"></input></td>\r\n                </tr>\r\n                <tr>\r\n                               <td>Password:</td>\r\n                               <td><input id=\"password1\" name=\"password1\" type=\"password\"></input></td>\r\n                </tr>\r\n                <tr>\r\n                               <td></td>\r\n                               <td><input id=\"submit\" type=\"submit\" value=\"Register\"></input></td>\r\n                </tr>\r\n                </table>\r\n                </center>\r\n</form>\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut there exists a different syntax according to HTML 5 (introduced 2014):\r\nhttps://www.w3schools.com/tags/att_input_form.asp\r\nIt is meant for input fields located outside the HTML form (but still being part of the form).\r\nIf you change the login form to this HTML 5 syntax, ZAP will not understand it:\r\n\r\n```\r\n<form id=\"ID_formgroup60E73963\" method=\"POST\"></form>\r\n<center>\r\n<table>\r\n         <tr>\r\n                  <td>Username (your email address):</td>\r\n                  <td><input form=\"ID_formgroup60E73963\" id=\"username\" name=\"username\"></input></td>\r\n        </tr>\r\n        <tr>\r\n                  <td>Password:</td>\r\n                  <td><input form=\"ID_formgroup60E73963\" id=\"password1\" name=\"password1\" type=\"password\"></input></td>\r\n       </tr>\r\n       <tr>\r\n                  <td></td>\r\n                  <td><input form=\"ID_formgroup60E73963\" id=\"submit\" type=\"submit\" value=\"Register\"></input></td>\r\n      </tr>\r\n</table>\r\n</center>\r\n</form>\r\n```\r\n\r\nMore precisely: the POST form is recognized, but parameters not. And without parameters scanning won't be succesful, of course.","closed_by":{"login":"psiinon","id":1081115,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwODExMTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1081115?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/psiinon","html_url":"https://github.com/psiinon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psiinon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psiinon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psiinon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psiinon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psiinon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psiinon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psiinon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psiinon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psiinon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zaproxy/zaproxy/issues/4422/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zaproxy/zaproxy/issues/4422/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
