using the Active Scan for a GET target Zap sends the header 'Content-Length: 0' in the requests.\r\n\r\nThis should not happen and can prevent scanning some servers which do reject the 'Content-Length: 0' header in GET requests.\r\n\r\nReproduction:\r\nInstall Python\r\nStart Python http server: `python -m http.server 7777`\r\nStart Zap GUI, proxy at 8080, turn off HUD\r\nMake a request using curl: `curl --proxy http://localhost:8080 http://localhost:7777`\r\nSee the request in Zap history\r\nRight click the request in Zap history, select \"Open/Resend in request editor\"\r\nSee that no \"content-length\" header is present\r\nRight click the request again, select \"Attack->Active Scan\"\r\nCheck the requests in the Active Scan tab\r\nSee that all the request have the header `Content-Length: 0`\r\n\r\nThe requests in the attack should not have the \"Content-Length\" header as some systems reject GET requests with it.\r\n\r\nZap version used:
