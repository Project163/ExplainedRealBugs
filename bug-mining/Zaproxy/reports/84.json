sessions view throws an exception, when trying to show a session which contains a token that starts with a number. This only happens for the XML output format, JSON and HTML work properly.\n### Exception:\n\nERROR API - INVALID_CHARACTER_ERR: An invalid or illegal XML character is specified.\norg.w3c.dom.DOMException: INVALID_CHARACTER_ERR: An invalid or illegal XML character is specified. \n    at com.sun.org.apache.xerces.internal.dom.CoreDocumentImpl.createElement(CoreDocumentImpl.java:622)\n    at org.zaproxy.zap.extension.api.ApiResponseSet.toXML(Unknown Source)\n    at org.zaproxy.zap.extension.api.ApiResponseList.toXML(Unknown Source)\n    at org.zaproxy.zap.extension.api.ApiResponseList.toXML(Unknown Source)\n    at org.zaproxy.zap.extension.api.API.responseToXml(Unknown Source)\n    at org.zaproxy.zap.extension.api.API.handleApiRequest(Unknown Source)\n    at org.parosproxy.paros.core.proxy.ProxyThread.processHttp(Unknown Source)\n    at org.parosproxy.paros.core.proxy.ProxyThread.run(Unknown Source)\n    at java.lang.Thread.run(Thread.java:745)\n### Steps to reproduce:\n1. Start ZAP and a browser with ZAP's proxy settings (e.g. localhost, port: 8090)\n2. Open a page in the browser, which contains a session token starting with a number\n   - Open a web page of your choice (e.g. http://example.com)\n   - [Add a session token](http://zap/UI/httpSessions/action/addSessionToken) that starts with a number (e.g. 1234567890)\n   - [Set the session token value](http://zap/UI/httpSessions/action/setSessionTokenValue)\n3. Open the [sessions view](http://zap/UI/httpSessions/view/sessions) and select XML as output format\n\n==> The error occurs, see log file [zap.zip](https://github.com/zaproxy/zaproxy/files/135853/zap.zip).\n### Possible solutions:\n1. Don't use the token names as element names.\n2. Add a prefix to the element names, to prevent that they start with a number, e.g. token_{tokenName}.\n","closed_by":{"login":"psiinon","id":1081115,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwODExMTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1081115?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/psiinon","html_url":"https://github.com/psiinon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psiinon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psiinon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psiinon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psiinon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psiinon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psiinon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psiinon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psiinon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psiinon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zaproxy/zaproxy/issues/2246/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zaproxy/zaproxy/issues/2246/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
