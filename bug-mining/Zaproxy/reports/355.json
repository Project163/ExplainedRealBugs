the bug**\r\nHi,\r\nNot sure if it's related to the version, but since the update to 2.10.0, I have this issue.\r\n\r\nIf I enable a proxy script, I have the error \"Secure Connection Failed\" in the browser when I try to connect to any url.\r\n- it was working fine before the update (not 100% sure when it start to fail)\r\n- I'm using dynamic SSL certificates, and SSL is working fine if I use proxy without any script enabled\r\n- I tested with Jython and  Zest script, even with basic provided templates (so it's not related to the script himself)\r\n- I tried to regenerate SSL certs, but doesn't help.\r\n- no error in logs\r\n\r\nFrom the browser side, it looks like the SSL is not validated when script is enabled.\r\n\r\nAny advice to solve this issue ? \r\n\r\nThanks\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\nSteps to reproduce the behavior:\r\n1. Setup dynamic SSL certificates and browser proxy to connect through zap\r\n2. Create new proxy script (jython or zest) and choose any default template\r\n3. Enable the script\r\n4. Connect to any url from browser\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nConnection should be done and the script should be executed.\r\n\r\n**Software versions**\r\n - ZAP: 2.10.0\r\n - Browser: Tried with Firefox & Chrome\r\n - OS : Kali linux\r\n\r\n**Errors from the zap.log file**\r\nNo error in zap log.\r\n\r\n**Would you like to help fix this issue?**\r\nsure","closed_by":{"login":"ricekot","id":16446369,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NDQ2MzY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16446369?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ricekot","html_url":"https://github.com/ricekot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ricekot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ricekot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ricekot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ricekot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ricekot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ricekot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ricekot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ricekot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ricekot/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zaproxy/zaproxy/issues/6381/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zaproxy/zaproxy/issues/6381/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
