the bug**\r\nI am attempting to import the Root CA that my company uses on our production proxies for transparent SSL decryption. The certificate is stored in a pem file with the unencrypted private key in the format outline in the user guide entry for Dynamic SSL Certificates. I have used this certificate with MITMProxy before and it works. I have tried this with an alternative CA that I have confirmed works and it yields the same result.\r\n\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\nSteps to reproduce the behavior:\r\n1. Open the Options menu and select the menu entry for \"Dynamic SSL Certificates.\"\r\n2. Click import and confirm \"Yes\" to overwrite existing certificate.\r\n3. Navigate to the directory containing the certificate, select the certificate file and click \"Open.\"\r\n4. No warnings or alerts are presented by the GUI, but the certificate is not imported.\r\n5. See error and additional context.\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nExpected the certificate to be imported and to appear in the certificate preview window of the application. In the case that there was an error importing the certificate, expected to receive a warning, alert, or other indication from the GUI.\r\n\r\n**Screenshots**\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n**Software versions**\r\n -
