If we have a way to abandon or terminate a particular plugin (or passive scanning of a specific request/response in general) that could be a way to handle things like the passive scanners that use Hirshberg. \r\n(Like: _Passive scanning of message x took longer than the configured timeout of 120sec, abandoning assessment of passive plugin y._)\r\n\r\nNote: For context, we've had performance problems related to the scanners which depend on the Hirshberg algorithm in the past....\r\n\r\nQuote @thc202:\r\n> Other scripts would benefit from this check (e.g. #3531, but if this is going to be added to core then it might not be necessary).\r\n> The timeout could also be dependent on the number of messages to scan?\r\n","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zaproxy/zaproxy/issues/3813/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zaproxy/zaproxy/issues/3813/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
