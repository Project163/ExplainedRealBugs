reported in OWASP ZAP User Group: https://groups.google.com/d/topic/zaproxy-users/uLceCjtc8wc/discussion\n\nSteps to reproduce the issue:\n1. Run ZAP;\n2. Set up a context with users (Cookie-based session management and the session token must match one defined in Options > HTTP Sessions);\n3. Spider (or active scan) the context with the defined user;\n4. Note that for each authentication attempt it's created a new entry in HTTP sessions tab. As with other automated requests (spider, active scanner, fuzzer...) the authentications requests should not be (processed and) shown in HTTP Sessions tab.\n\nZAP Versions:\nVersions >= 2.0.0\n","closed_by":{"login":"psiinon","id":1081115,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwODExMTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1081115?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/psiinon","html_url":"https://github.com/psiinon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psiinon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psiinon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psiinon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psiinon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psiinon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psiinon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psiinon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psiinon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psiinon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zaproxy/zaproxy/issues/2674/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zaproxy/zaproxy/issues/2674/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
