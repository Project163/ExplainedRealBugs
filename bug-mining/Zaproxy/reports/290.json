using the same approach when it was thrown.\r\n\r\n1. started zaproxy(develop branch) dev build in debug mode from eclipse\r\n2. loaded the authenticationhelper-1.1.0 add-on\r\n - this add-on has a passive scan rule\r\n - `extensionPassiveScan.addPassiveScanner(getAutoConfigurationPassiveScanner());` not added through `ZapAddOn.xml`\r\n - the passive scan rule scans the response message to detect login page(in this scenario) and have some authentication auto configuration logic\r\n3. opened firefox using `Launch Browser` option in ZAP and logged in to the proxied web application (bodgeit)\r\n4. made some changes to the add-on\r\n5. loaded the newly built add-on **without unloading the previous one or restarting zap**\r\n - `PassiveScanThread` may have had pending jobs, don't remember correctly, usually has pending jobs\r\n6. created a new session in ZAP\r\n7. opened firefox using `Launch Browser` option in ZAP and logged in to the proxied web application\r\n8. above exception was logged in the console\r\n9. the add-on completed its job as expected\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nno such exception is thrown\r\n\r\n**Errors from the zap.log file**\r\n2018-08-07
