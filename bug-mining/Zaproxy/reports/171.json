https://groups.google.com/d/topic/zaproxy-users/jU2bt0f4b-c/discussion (although that's not the only thread/issue about \"URL Not Found\").\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce the issue:\r\n1. Start ZAP;\r\n2. Access the targets to be scanned, e.g.:\r\n   - http://example.com/dir/file1.jsp\r\n   - http://example.com/dir/file2.jsp\r\n3. Start the active scan, through the ZAP API, with the \"directory\" that contains the files http://example.com/dir/\r\n4. Note that it says \"URL Not Found in the Scan Tree\" (although it exists as non-leaf node).\r\n\r\nThe change will allow to start the active scans through the ZAP API with a directory (non-leaf node), as it's possible through the GUI when selecting the \"dir\" node.","closed_by":{"login":"psiinon","id":1081115,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwODExMTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1081115?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/psiinon","html_url":"https://github.com/psiinon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psiinon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psiinon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psiinon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psiinon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psiinon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psiinon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psiinon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psiinon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psiinon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zaproxy/zaproxy/issues/3232/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zaproxy/zaproxy/issues/3232/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
