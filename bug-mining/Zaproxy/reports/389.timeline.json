Describe the bug\r\n\r\nOn the fresh Zap installation the plugins directory looks like the following:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n⋊> /A/O/C/J/plugin pwd\r\n/Applications/OWASP

if I run a zap command with the custom home directory, it fails to run:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n⋊> /A/O/C/Java pwd\r\n/Applications/OWASP ZAP.app/Contents/Java\r\n\r\n⋊> /A/O/C/Java bash zap.sh -cmd -dir

to start ZAP. The mandatory add-on was not found: callhome\r\nRefer to https://www.zaproxy.org/docs/developer/ if you are building ZAP from source.\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe bug is relevant to the Mac OS systems, because the user has ownership of the installation directory. But in order to reproduce it on linux you need to change the owner of the installation directory to your current user:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nsudo chown -R user:user /path/to/installation/zap/directory/\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce the behavior\r\n\r\n1. Perform fresh installation of Zap\r\n2. Change the owner of the installation folder to the current user (linux users only)\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nsudo chown -R user:user /path/to/installation/zap/directory/\r\n```\r\n\r\n4. Go to the zap installation directory\r\n\r\n```bash\r\ncd /path/to/zap/installation/directory\r\n```\r\n\r\n6. Run the plugin update\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nbash zap.sh -cmd -addonupdate\r\n```\r\n\r\n7. Run the zap with the custom home directory\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nbash zap.sh -cmd -dir /tmp/somedirectory\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\n\r\nThe command is completed without errors.\r\n\r\n###

is a workaround for upstream ZAP issue 7703\r\nhttps://github.com/zaproxy/zaproxy/issues/7703\r\n\r\nWaiting for the upstream fix to be pulled in a stable release.\r\n\r\nIssue description:\r\nZAP attempts to delete outdated plugins. The problem is that, in MacOS, the installation is done as the user, and thus the user has permission to delete the installation's plugins, and most of the plugins are deleted.\r\nThe updated version of those plugins are stored in the user's home ZAP directory, but RapiDAST no longer use this directory.\r\n\r\nThe result is: ZAP refuses to start because 2 mandatory plugins are missing.\r\n\r\nThe workaround:\r\nWhen the mandatory plugins are found to be missing, this happens:\r\n\r\n1) the plugins are manually downloaded, straight from upstream. This is sufficient to run ZAP, but not sufficient to run RapiDAST, because other plugins are still missing (e.g.: automation plugin)\r\n\r\n2) RapiDAST then installs *all* plugins.\r\n\r\nThe downside of this is a longer runtime, because not only RapiDAST must be run 1 more time, it also has to download all plugins. The other downside is size: the plugin are roughly ½GB in size. This will be deleted after the RapiDAST run (in case of success).\r\n\r\nTo avoid the downside, in MacOS, you can do the following: \r\n1- Reinstall ZAP, but DO NOT RUN IT! (or it will delete the installation plugins)\r\n2- change the ownership of the ZAP application to `root`, so that when run as a regular user, the deletion of the plugins will fail. \r\n3- then you can run ZAP and RapiDAST normally\r\n\r\nThe README was updated to contain the above information, in the \"troubleshooting\" chapter.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/RedHatProductSecurity/rapidast/issues/104/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/RedHatProductSecurity/rapidast/issues/104/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":9629570919,"node_id":"REFE_lADOAjHKnc5c3_i6zwAAAAI995dn","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zaproxy/zaproxy/issues/events/9629570919","actor":{"login":"jeremychoi","id":25311915,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1MzExOTE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25311915?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeremychoi","html_url":"https://github.com/jeremychoi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeremychoi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeremychoi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeremychoi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeremychoi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeremychoi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeremychoi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeremychoi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeremychoi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeremychoi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"9878517e8a8aa9d414372bf43c5403f1360b5362","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/RedHatProductSecurity/rapidast/commits/9878517e8a8aa9d414372bf43c5403f1360b5362","created_at":"2023-06-25T11:53:20Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zaproxy/zaproxy/issues/comments/1624509369","html_url":"https://github.com/zaproxy/zaproxy/issues/7703#issuecomment-1624509369","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zaproxy/zaproxy/issues/7703","id":1624509369,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAjHKnc5g1Au5","user":{"login":"github-actions[bot]","id":41898282,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90NDE4OTgyODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/15368?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/github-actions","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-07-07T01:32:55Z","updated_at":"2023-07-07T01:32:55Z","body":"This issue has been automatically locked since there has not been any recent activity after it was closed.
