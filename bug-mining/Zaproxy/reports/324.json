idea came from an email thread:\r\n\r\nQuote @kingthorin:\r\n>I've also been thinking in both the context configuration tree and more specifically the options panel it'd be awesome if we had a filter. For example in the options panel type local or proxy and the tree is filtered to only show \"Local Proxy\". Initially this only needs to be based on tree entries, down the road I can see users wanting to be able to filter/search specific options themselves.\r\n\r\nQuote @psiinon:\r\n>The options filter/search could be tricky to implement, but would be really useful to users.\r\nIf we have to make a set of core changes to enable it, then maybe we should create a (set of) class(es) which represents an option, in a similar way to how we represent API end points.\r\nThis might allow us make config screens much easier to produce - most of them could be generated on the fly automatically which a small number of custom ones for more complex interfaces.\r\nIt would also allow us to expose the config values via the UI, ie the ones that can be specified via the '-config' cmdline option.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"psiinon","id":1081115,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwODExMTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1081115?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/psiinon","html_url":"https://github.com/psiinon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psiinon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psiinon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psiinon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psiinon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psiinon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psiinon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psiinon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psiinon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psiinon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zaproxy/zaproxy/issues/3358/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zaproxy/zaproxy/issues/3358/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
