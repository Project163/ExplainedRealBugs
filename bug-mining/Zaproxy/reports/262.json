to reproduce the issue:\r\n1. Run ZAP;\r\n2. Set up context authentication, with wrong logged in/out indicators to force the re-authentication (easier to notice/reproduce the issue).\r\n3. Enable Forced User mode;\r\n4. Send/re-send a message with Manual Request Editor, notice that the authentication is attempted (History or Output tabs);\r\n5. Disable Forced User mode;\r\n6.
