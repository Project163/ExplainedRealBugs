[The user's default ZAP directory](https://github.com/zaproxy/zap-core-help/wiki/HelpUiDialogsOptionsJvm) containing \".ZAP_JVM.properties\" is [determined by \"user.home\" Java system property](https://github.com/zaproxy/zaproxy/blob/w2017-10-30/src/org/parosproxy/paros/Constant.java#L326) which usually equals to `%USERPROFILE%`, not `%HOMEDRIVE%%HOMEPATH%`.\r\n2. `%HOMEDRIVE%%HOMEPATH%` can be different to `%USERPROFILE%`. (Actually I experienced it on a Windows machine managed by Active Directory. Of course, it caused an error same as #3211) See [about these variables](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/606483/what-is-the-meaning-of-these-windows-environment-variables-homedrive-homepath#8797855)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Detail about reason 1\r\n\r\nHow \"user.home\" property is set is rather complicated, please see [stackoverflow answer](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/16889940/on-windows-7-how-does-java-jvm-set-user-home-system-property#16889969).\r\n\r\nHere is summary:\r\n* In Java 8: It equals to `%USERPROFILE%`\r\n* In Java 7:  It seems to equal to `%USERPROFILE%` by default.\r\n\r\n## Impact by adopting suggestion\r\n* Users who have had `%HOMEDRIVE%%HOMEPATH%` different to `%USERPROFILE%` and put \".ZAP_JVM.properties\" in only `%HOMEDRIVE%%HOMEPATH%` will get an error same as #3211\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zaproxy/zaproxy/issues/4004/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zaproxy/zaproxy/issues/4004/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":2759665216,"node_id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDI3NTk2NjUyMTY=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zaproxy/zaproxy/issues/events/2759665216","actor":{"login":"kingthorin","id":7570458,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc1NzA0NTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7570458?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kingthorin","html_url":"https://github.com/kingthorin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kingthorin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kingthorin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kingthorin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kingthorin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kingthorin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kingthorin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kingthorin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kingthorin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kingthorin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-10-31T12:51:29Z","label":{"name":"historic","color":"c2e0c6"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zaproxy/zaproxy/issues/comments/581099721","html_url":"https://github.com/zaproxy/zaproxy/issues/3211#issuecomment-581099721","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zaproxy/zaproxy/issues/3211","id":581099721,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU4MTA5OTcyMQ==","user":{"login":"lock[bot]","id":33595554,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90MzM1OTU1NTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/6672?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lock%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/lock","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lock%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lock%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lock%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lock%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lock%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lock%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lock%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lock%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lock%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-02-02T05:12:56Z","updated_at":"2020-02-02T05:12:56Z","body":"This thread has been automatically locked since there has not been any recent activity after it was closed.
