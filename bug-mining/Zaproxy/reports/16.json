Run ZAP (easier to see the issue with ZAP built from @a7a6e806cb9c891ffe5bd0e56e1c19af831d6148 and \"Active scanner rules\" add-on built from zaproxy/zap-extensions@e19160d8ac7d36e7b33de5953cd984c274dd215a);\n2. Configure a context and disable DB technology;\n3. Active scan the node of the selected context;\n4. Note that the \"SQL Injection\" scanner was run even if DB was not enabled;\n5. Run again the active scan but this time override the technologies of the context and disable the DB technology (in \"Technology\" tab after enabling \"Show advanced options\").\n6. Note that this time the \"SQL Injection\" scanner was not run as expected.\n\nRemarks:\nThis also affects the API when active scanning as an user (although in this case it's not possible to override the technology).\n\nZAP Version:\nVersion 2.4.0 (and weekly releases).\n","closed_by":{"login":"thc202","id":4639210,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ2MzkyMTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4639210?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/thc202","html_url":"https://github.com/thc202","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thc202/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thc202/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thc202/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thc202/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thc202/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thc202/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thc202/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thc202/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thc202/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zaproxy/zaproxy/issues/1735/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zaproxy/zaproxy/issues/1735/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
