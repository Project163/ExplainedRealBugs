In Browser: Go to https://duckduckgo.com/ and enter \"zaproxy\" in the search field\nand press enter.\n3. In ZAP in the history tab right click on the entry \"https://duckduckgo.com/?q=zaproxy\n4. Select \"Break\" and press \"Save\" in the \"Edit break point\" popup.\n5. In browser: Reload the search results.\n\nWhat is the expected output? What do you see instead?\nExpected a break but request is routed through ZAP without breaking. If I change the\nBreakpoint-String in the Break-Tab to \"duckduckgo.com\" only, it works. If I use \"q=zaproxy\"\nas Breakpoint-String it does not.\nAs a result I think that query parameters are not considered when breaking.\n\nPlease use labels and text to provide additional information.\n\n\n```\n\nOriginal issue reported on code.google.com by `robert.koch@loggia.at` on 2014-03-10 14:26:47\n","closed_by":{"login":"psiinon","id":1081115,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwODExMTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1081115?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/psiinon","html_url":"https://github.com/psiinon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psiinon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psiinon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psiinon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psiinon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psiinon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psiinon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psiinon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psiinon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psiinon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zaproxy/zaproxy/issues/1070/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zaproxy/zaproxy/issues/1070/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
