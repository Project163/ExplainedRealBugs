add-ons to declare and bundle its dependencies, instead of creating a uber jar (all the classes/files of the dependencies and of the add-on included in the same jar).\nThe change allows the add-ons to correctly depend on OSGi bundles (which use jar's MANIFEST file to declare what it provides/needs) and also allows to include signed jars.\nThe declared dependencies would be deployed and loaded from the file system instead of directly from the add-on file.\n\nThe add-on birtreports does not currently work because its OSGi dependencies are not correctly loaded (and reason why it was removed from the marketplace).\n","closed_by":{"login":"psiinon","id":1081115,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwODExMTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1081115?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/psiinon","html_url":"https://github.com/psiinon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psiinon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psiinon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psiinon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psiinon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psiinon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psiinon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psiinon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psiinon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psiinon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zaproxy/zaproxy/issues/2619/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zaproxy/zaproxy/issues/2619/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
