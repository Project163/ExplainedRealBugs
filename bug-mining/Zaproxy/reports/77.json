discussed in OWASP ZAP Scripts group: https://groups.google.com/d/msg/zaproxy-scripts/a7Tv8VE5C4Q/wpI5NJBRBwAJ\n\nThe authentication script has only the [`AuthenticationHelper`](https://github.com/zaproxy/zaproxy/blob/develop/src/org/zaproxy/zap/authentication/AuthenticationHelper.java) object, and can't do much with it besides sending requests. The `helper` should provide means to configure the messages, providing access to methods such as `setRemoveUserDefinedAuthHeaders()`, `setMaxRetriesOnIOError()`, `setMaxRedirects()` and `setAllowCircularRedirects()` from its [`HttpSender`](https://github.com/zaproxy/zaproxy/blob/develop/src/org/parosproxy/paros/network/HttpSender.java) object, so the script could easily configure those parameters.\n\nWe could either expose the `HttpSender` or duplicate those methods in the `AuthenticationHelper`.\n","closed_by":{"login":"psiinon","id":1081115,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwODExMTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1081115?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/psiinon","html_url":"https://github.com/psiinon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psiinon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psiinon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psiinon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psiinon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psiinon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psiinon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psiinon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psiinon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psiinon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zaproxy/zaproxy/issues/2070/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zaproxy/zaproxy/issues/2070/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
