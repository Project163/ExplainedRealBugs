to reproduce the issue:\r\n1. Run ZAP (with Java 9);\r\n2. Close ZAP and note the size of the configuration file (`config.xml` in home dir);\r\n3. Restart ZAP several times and note that the size of the configuration file keeps increasing.\r\n\r\nFor example, starting with:\r\n```XML\r\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\" standalone=\"no\"?>\r\n<config>\r\n    <connection>\r\n        <proxyChain/>\r\n    </connection>\r\n</config>\r\n```\r\nends up in:\r\n```XML\r\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\" standalone=\"no\"?>\r\n<config>\r\n    <connection>\r\n                                                        \r\n        \r\n        \r\n        \r\n        \r\n        \r\n        <proxyChain/>\r\n                                                    \r\n    \r\n    \r\n    \r\n    \r\n    \r\n    </connection>\r\n</config>\r\n```\r\n\r\nRemarks:\r\nThis is related to XML indentation [changes in Java 9](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/9-notes-3745703.html#JDK-8087303) (same behaviour with Java 10). The continuous addition of the empty lines around `proxyChain` seems to be a bug, lines before/after the elements `config` or `connection` are properly removed and indented, for example:\r\n```XML\r\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\" standalone=\"no\"?>\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t\t<config>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    <connection><proxyChain/></connection>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n</config>\r\n```\r\nis changed to:\r\n```XML\r\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\" standalone=\"no\"?>\r\n<config>\r\n    <connection>\r\n        <proxyChain/>\r\n    </connection>\r\n</config>\r\n```\r\n(But with following saves it starts adding the new lines.)\r\n\r\nThe workaround is to disable the indentation when saving the configuration file. \r\n\r\nZAP\r\nVersion 2.7.0 (and older).","closed_by":{"login":"kingthorin","id":7570458,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc1NzA0NTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7570458?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kingthorin","html_url":"https://github.com/kingthorin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kingthorin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kingthorin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kingthorin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kingthorin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kingthorin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kingthorin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kingthorin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kingthorin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kingthorin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zaproxy/zaproxy/issues/4194/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zaproxy/zaproxy/issues/4194/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
