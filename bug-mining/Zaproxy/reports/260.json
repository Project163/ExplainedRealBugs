as I can select URL for `swagger.json` file and then I can specify host name (www.myapi.com).\r\nSee the picture below:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13673826/34975271-2cdba0f6-fae5-11e7-91f9-30b4a3884c0a.png)\r\n\r\nHowever, when running\r\n```\r\ndocker run -t owasp/zap2docker-weekly zap-api-scan.py -t \\\r\n        https://www.myapi.com/swagger/v1/swagger.json -f openapi\r\n```\r\nI could not find a way to pass the second parameter (Override Host) ..\r\n\r\nThe reason Host parameter is required - the `swagger.json` file does not know where it is hosted so it does not contain `host` field.\r\n\r\nP.S. tried both `docker run -t owasp/zap2docker-weekly` and `docker run -t owasp/zap2docker-stable`.
