Version: 2017-10-30 (weekly release)\r\n\r\n## Suggenstion and Reasons\r\n\r\n**zap.bat** should use `%USERPROFILE%` instead of `%HOMEDRIVE%%HOMEPATH%` to locate the file \".ZAP_JVM.properties\".\r\n\r\nThere are two reasons:\r\n1. [The user's default ZAP directory](https://github.com/zaproxy/zap-core-help/wiki/HelpUiDialogsOptionsJvm) containing \".ZAP_JVM.properties\" is [determined by \"user.home\" Java system property](https://github.com/zaproxy/zaproxy/blob/w2017-10-30/src/org/parosproxy/paros/Constant.java#L326) which usually equals to `%USERPROFILE%`, not `%HOMEDRIVE%%HOMEPATH%`.\r\n2. `%HOMEDRIVE%%HOMEPATH%` can be different to `%USERPROFILE%`. (Actually I experienced it on a Windows machine managed by Active Directory. Of course, it caused an error same as #3211) See [about these variables](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/606483/what-is-the-meaning-of-these-windows-environment-variables-homedrive-homepath#8797855)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Detail about reason 1\r\n\r\nHow \"user.home\" property is set is rather complicated, please see [stackoverflow answer](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/16889940/on-windows-7-how-does-java-jvm-set-user-home-system-property#16889969).\r\n\r\nHere is summary:\r\n* In Java 8: It equals to `%USERPROFILE%`\r\n* In Java 7:  It seems to equal to `%USERPROFILE%` by default.\r\n\r\n## Impact by adopting suggestion\r\n* Users who have had `%HOMEDRIVE%%HOMEPATH%` different to `%USERPROFILE%` and put \".ZAP_JVM.properties\" in only `%HOMEDRIVE%%HOMEPATH%` will get an error same as #3211\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"psiinon","id":1081115,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwODExMTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1081115?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/psiinon","html_url":"https://github.com/psiinon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psiinon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psiinon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psiinon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psiinon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psiinon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psiinon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psiinon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psiinon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psiinon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zaproxy/zaproxy/issues/4004/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zaproxy/zaproxy/issues/4004/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
