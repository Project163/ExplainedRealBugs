to some restrictions, I usually push all of my tool traffic through a server that\neveryone knows is 'safe'. I usually use SSH tunnels for this sort of thing (ssh -D\n$PORT $HOST), which creates a SOCKS5 proxy listening locally to $HOST. \n\nThat way I can use proxychains to wrap anything I want through my proxy, but ZAP only\naccepts http proxies, so I have a polipo instance running acting as a liaison between\nmy local SOCKS listener and ZAP. It'd be quite nice if ZAP could support SOCKS proxying!\n```\n\nOriginal issue reported on code.google.com by `fitblip` on 2010-12-17 19:07:11\n","closed_by":{"login":"psiinon","id":1081115,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwODExMTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1081115?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/psiinon","html_url":"https://github.com/psiinon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psiinon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psiinon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psiinon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psiinon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psiinon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psiinon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psiinon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psiinon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psiinon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zaproxy/zaproxy/issues/29/reactions","total_count":4,"+1":4,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zaproxy/zaproxy/issues/29/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
