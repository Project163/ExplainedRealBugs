am testing some application on Android which communicates with server over the XML\nSOAP messages. The content is of the request as comming from client is XML encoded\nwith gzip. The same is on the way back from the server (XML+gzip).\n\nZAP correctly (in most cases) decodes the responses from server, but the problem is\nthat requests from client are gzip binary garbage so it is not easy to fuzz or do whatever\nelse with it. \n\nPlease could you consider adding the support for the gzip encoded requests and not\nonly the gzip encoded responses?\n\nThe request from client looks like this:\nPOST http://X.XXX.XXX.XX:8085/doLogin HTTP/1.1\nContent-Type: application/xml\nContent-Encoding: gzip\nUser-Agent: [android-9eadc32e98dce184]-14100119571190520001\nContent-Length: 223\nConnection: close\nHost: X.XXX.XXX.XX:8085\n\nXXXXXX-Binary-gzip-garbage-XXXXXXXXX\n\n\nWhat is the expected output? What do you see instead?\nIn window of the request payload I would expect to see something like\n<MSG>\n  <Hdr Id=\"55035660\" Ver=\"1.038\" Dtm=\"2014-09-08T11:45:13\">\n    <Sndr AppCd=\"ESB\" AppNm=\"ESB\"/>\n    <Rcp AppCd=\"GCA\" AppNm=\"GCA\">\n      <GId Id=\"14090813450758190001\" IdTp=\"RQMSGID\"/>\n    </Rcp>\n  </Hdr>\n  <Bd>\n    <Usr UsrId=\"user01\">\n    <Pass Passwd=\"password\">\n  </Bd>\n</MSG>\n\n\n\nWhat version of the product are you using? On what operating system?\nI have tried with ZAP 2.3.1 and also with the weekly build ZAP_D-2014-09-29\n\nBest regards\nMichal Ambroz\n\n\n\n\n```\n\nOriginal issue reported on code.google.com by `michal.ambroz` on 2014-10-02 09:40:37\n","closed_by":{"login":"psiinon","id":1081115,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwODExMTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1081115?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/psiinon","html_url":"https://github.com/psiinon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psiinon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psiinon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psiinon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psiinon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psiinon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psiinon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psiinon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psiinon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psiinon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zaproxy/zaproxy/issues/1351/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zaproxy/zaproxy/issues/1351/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
