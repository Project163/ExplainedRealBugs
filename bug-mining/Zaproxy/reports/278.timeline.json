 After further research, I ran into a few questions I'd like to have answered to help understand what I need to do (I'm really new to http requests :D). \n1. Currently, ZAP supports a urlencoded format with a separate text field for the user to enter POST parameters. ZAP attempts to extract the username and password parameters once the user enters the information in the POST data field. In order to support JSON authentication, I would need to allow ZAP to recognize that the user is entering JSON data (through a combo box in the GUI), and set up an HttpClient request accordingly. \n2. Independent of this new feature, I would also add support to allow a user to choose \"manual type\" to allow a user to manually select replacement tokens from within the parameter data.\n\nDo I have the right idea so far?
