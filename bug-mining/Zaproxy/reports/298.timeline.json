the Break Tool to the HUD.\r\n\r\nThis PR includes:\r\n- the vue.js modal to display intercepted break messages\r\n- the ability to edit intercepted messages from the modal\r\n- toggle the break on/off without a dialog\r\n\r\nThere are still some bugs, but I thought it may be easier to figure them out if people play with it and give me feedback. Noticed issues include:\r\n- sometimes an intercepted break message being displayed in the HUD will quickly change to show another message, even though the original message is the one shown in desktop ZAP\r\n- sometimes a message is intercepted in desktop ZAP but a websocket break message doesn't appear in the HUD\r\n\r\nThis PR also contains the changes for the HTTP POST & Heartbeat PRs I submitted separately. Please review and approve those first, and then I'll merge those so they aren't highlighted
