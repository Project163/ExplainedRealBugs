Please describe.**\r\nWhen using the most excellent zap-baseline.py from the Docker image as part of a build pipeline, it returns a non zero code for warnings. The return code is distinct for failures vs warnings.\r\n\r\nThis causes build pipelines to generally fail - as the convention of non zero meaning \"all is not ok\" is used (and with build pipelines - it is mostly all or nothing, pass/fail). \r\n\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nI have a pull request open ( https://github.com/zaproxy/zaproxy/pull/4825 ) that ads in an option to ignore warnings (they are still logged, they just don't change the response code). \r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\nI thought maybe warnings could be upgraded to return a failure (if they are a problem) but clearly they are warnings for a reason!\r\nAlso did consider build pipelines that take the response code and specifically ignore the warning return code (but that seems a little hack-ish). \r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nRelevant when using the docker image as part of a build pipeline. \r\n","closed_by":{"login":"thc202","id":4639210,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ2MzkyMTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4639210?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/thc202","html_url":"https://github.com/thc202","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thc202/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thc202/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thc202/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thc202/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thc202/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thc202/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thc202/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thc202/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thc202/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zaproxy/zaproxy/issues/4824/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zaproxy/zaproxy/issues/4824/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
