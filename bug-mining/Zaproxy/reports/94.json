to reproduce the issue(s):\n1. Run ZAP;\n2. Change the option (\"Options\" > \"Display\" >) \"Show break buttons:\" to \"Only in the break panel\" and restart ZAP;\n3. Note that in the \"Break\" panel it's missing the button (or buttons, if \"Separate Request and Response buttons\" is set) to enable the breakpoints;\n4. Enable the breakpoints through the menu \"Tools\" > \"Toggle Break on All Requests\";\n5. Proxy a request, forward the request and once the response is received note that the button is now shown, as well the \"separate\" buttons.\n\nZAP Versions:\nVersions >= 2.4.0\n","closed_by":{"login":"psiinon","id":1081115,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwODExMTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1081115?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/psiinon","html_url":"https://github.com/psiinon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psiinon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psiinon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psiinon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psiinon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psiinon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psiinon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psiinon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psiinon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psiinon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zaproxy/zaproxy/issues/2366/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zaproxy/zaproxy/issues/2366/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
