Describe the bug\n\nThis has been raised before: https://github.com/zaproxy/zaproxy/issues/1284\r\n\r\nI am experiencing the same issue, however for a PUT request. Mozilla describes two use cases for the header, where the second reads:\r\n\r\n> For other methods, and in particular for [PUT](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods/PUT), If-None-Match used with the * value can be used to save a file not known to exist, guaranteeing that another upload didn't happen before, losing the data of the previous put;\r\n\r\nhttps://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/If-None-Match\r\n\r\nFrom what I understood, ZAP strips the header since it's related to caching and one want's fresh data. However, PUT requests shouldn't be cacheable anyways.\n\n### Steps to reproduce the behavior\n\nProxy a request containing the header through ZAP\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nHeader is not stripped\n\n### Software versions\n\nowasp/zap2docker-bare:2.11.1\n\n### Screenshots\n\n_No response_\n\n### Errors from the zap.log file\n\n_No response_\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_\n\n### Would you like to help fix this issue?\n\n- [X] Yes","closed_by":{"login":"kingthorin","id":7570458,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc1NzA0NTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7570458?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kingthorin","html_url":"https://github.com/kingthorin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kingthorin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kingthorin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kingthorin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kingthorin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kingthorin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kingthorin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kingthorin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kingthorin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kingthorin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zaproxy/zaproxy/issues/7353/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zaproxy/zaproxy/issues/7353/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
