the bug**\r\nZap able to detect SQL injection from query params but not route params.\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\nI created a simple flask app that has an ```http://127.0.0.1/api/user/<name>``` endpoint with SQL injections on purpose.\r\n```\r\nfrom flask import Flask, request\r\nimport psycopg2\r\n\r\n@app.route('/api/user/<name>')\r\ndef main(name):\r\n  (.....omitted.....)\r\n    with conn.cursor() as cursor:\r\n         cursor.execute(\"SELECT * FROM users WHERE name = '%s' \" % name)\r\n```\r\nI can penetrate this app manually by ```http://127.0.0.1/api/user/' or '1'='1'--```, but Zap is not able to detect this vulnerability.\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/19234081/79096952-1e483500-7d91-11ea-8d0b-6aa680b3915d.png)\r\n\r\nI changed my flask app to ```http://127.0.0.1/api/user?name=<name>``` then this time zap is able to detect it.\r\n```\r\nfrom flask import Flask, request\r\nimport psycopg2\r\n\r\n@app.route('/api/user')\r\ndef main():\r\n    name = request.args.get('name')\r\n  (.....omitted.....)\r\n    with conn.cursor() as cursor:\r\n         cursor.execute(\"SELECT * FROM users WHERE name = '%s' \" % name)\r\n```\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/19234081/79096908-ff49a300-7d90-11ea-9741-b0e59fcb1c7b.png)\r\n\r\nI am thinking about whether this might be related to an white-space encoding issue, because it seems like when attacking  ```http://127.0.0.1/api/user/<name>```:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/19234081/79097015-42a41180-7d91-11ea-9009-ff351f49fa92.png)\r\nthe + signs for whitespace are not decoded correctly, resulting in an sql syntax error instead of detecting the sql injection vulnerability. However the + sign seems to be decoded correctly for the query params, so I am not sure what is causing this difference.\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nZap should be able to detect SQL injection for both query param and route params.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Software versions**\r\n - ZAP: 2.9.0\r\n - OS: MacOS mojave 10.14.5\r\n\r\n**Errors from the zap.log file**\r\nno errors\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"ricekot","id":16446369,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NDQ2MzY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16446369?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ricekot","html_url":"https://github.com/ricekot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ricekot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ricekot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ricekot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ricekot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ricekot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ricekot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ricekot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ricekot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ricekot/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zaproxy/zaproxy/issues/5935/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zaproxy/zaproxy/issues/5935/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
