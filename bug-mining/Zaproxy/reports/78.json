working on jenkins plugin for ZAP, which will be used by developers and configured by Security Auditors (https://github.com/hackthem/zapkins.git ).\nWhile implementing the script authentication form, i found that they can not be filled with the logged in and logged out indicators.\nThat will be pretty if a developer has not to provide those two parameters (logged in and logged out indicators) before launching the job.\n\nIs it possible to implement this ?\n\nCheers,\n\nAbdellah
