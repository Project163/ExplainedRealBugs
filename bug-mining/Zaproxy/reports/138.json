Allow users to override alert details, eg to include or point to internal / company specific info.\n## More detail\n\nMany companies have their own advice and guidance for avoiding security vulnerabilities.\nThe may have their own terminology, and can often provide very specific information such as company mandated policies for specific languages platforms.\n## Proposal\n\nNew ‘alert override’ configuration file which can be specified via the command line / changed via the UI and stored in the config file.\nFormat something like:\n\n`<alertid>.name = New name`\n`<alertid>.description = New description`\n`<alertid>.otherInfo = New other info`\n`<alertid>.solution = Use our ‘fixes-everything’ lib`\n`<alertid>.reference = http://internet.example.com/xss.html`\n`<alertid>.extra = Extra info that wont overwrite anything`\n\nOnly generic info should be overridden, alert specific info such as the URI, attack, parameter, evidence and confidence shouldn’t be changed.\nThe file only needs to contain what needs to be changed, eg could just be:\n\n`# 40012 = Reflected XSS`\n`40012.extra = Follow our company specific guidelines at http://internet.example.com/xss.html`\n\nCould also support adding rather than replacing info if the relevant line starts with a ‘+’, eg\n\n`# 40012 = Reflected XSS`\n`40012.solution = + Also follow our company specific guidelines at http://internet.example.com`/xss.html\n\nIn this case the above text would be added to the standard XSS solution.\n## Implementation\n\nIntroduce new ‘extraInfo’ alert field, which scan rules should not set (protected methods?). Add to HTML and XML reports if present.\nIf file specified load as a properties file on start or when added.\nWhen new alerts raised check for overrides and apply directly to the alerts as required.\nWill therefore automatically appear in the UI, HTML and XML reports.\nDon’t apply to existing alerts? Can revisit.\n## Why not add to the alert filters?\n\nAlert filters are really for changing specific alerts, eg “The XSS on https://www.example.com is a False Positive”.\nThese overrides are for changing generic information about alerts, ie the information that is either hard coded or read from the relevant add-on properties file.\nWhile they are both related to alerts, combining them into the same mechanism feels wrong, somehow.\n## Open Questions\n- Should new overrides apply to existing alerts? \n  - “No” is easier ;)\n- Should it be possible to change things like risk?\n  - Possibly not as that’s what alert filters are for\n","closed_by":{"login":"kingthorin","id":7570458,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc1NzA0NTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7570458?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kingthorin","html_url":"https://github.com/kingthorin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kingthorin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kingthorin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kingthorin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kingthorin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kingthorin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kingthorin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kingthorin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kingthorin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kingthorin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zaproxy/zaproxy/issues/2853/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zaproxy/zaproxy/issues/2853/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
