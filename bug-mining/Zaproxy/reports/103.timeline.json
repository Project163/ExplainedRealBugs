scanners to notify that a (non-HTTP) message was sent and change\nHostProcess to keep track of the requests sent (that is, notified) by\neach scanner, so that the request count is more accurate.\n\nMore detailed changes:\n- HostProcess:\n  - Add methods notifyNewMessage(Plugin plugin, HttpMessage), to know\n    which scanner sent the HTTP message, and notifyNewMessage(Plugin),\n    for the same purpose but for non-HTTP messages;\n  - Add method getRequestCount(), to obtain the request count (of all\n    scanners and Analyser);\n  - Refactor the management of the stats collected from each scanner\n    (start time, progress and request count), by using a nested class\n    (PluginStats) and replacing the existing maps (plugin ID to each\n    stat) with only one (plugin ID to PluginStats).\n  - Change processPlugin(Plugin) to initialise the PluginStats of the\n    scanner being processed;\n  - Change scanSingleNode(Plugin, StructuralNode) to increase the\n    progress of Plugin;\n  - Change getTestCurrentCount(Plugin), getPluginRequestCount(int) and\n    pluginCompleted(Plugin) to use the new stats map/class;\n  - Deprecate setTestCurrentCount(Plugin, int), no longer needed the\n    progress is now maintained internally;\n  - Deprecate setPluginRequestCount(int, int), no longer needed the\n    request count is now maintained internally;\n- AbstractAppPlugin, remove the manual setting of Plugin's progress, no\n  longer needed, HostProcess takes care of keeping track of progress;\n- AbstractPlugin, change to notify the HostProcess with Plugin itself,\n  so the requests sent are correctly counted;\n- Analyser, change to allow to obtain the request count, included in\n  the total request count of the HostProcess;\n- ActiveScan, change to obtain the request counts from the HostProcess\n  instead of calculating manually (and deprecate the method that was\n  doing that);\n- ActiveScanAPI and ScanProgressTableModel, remove calls to ActiveScan\n  to update the request counts.\n\nFix #2420 - Allow active scanners to notify that a message was sent\nFix #2421 - Active scanner request count mismatch\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zaproxy/zaproxy/issues/2424/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zaproxy/zaproxy/issues/2424/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"actor":{"login":"thc202","id":4639210,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ2MzkyMTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4639210?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/thc202","html_url":"https://github.com/thc202","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thc202/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thc202/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thc202/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thc202/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thc202/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thc202/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thc202/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thc202/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thc202/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-04-21T18:46:27Z","updated_at":"2016-04-21T18:46:27Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zaproxy/zaproxy/issues/2425","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zaproxy/zaproxy","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zaproxy/zaproxy/issues/2425/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zaproxy/zaproxy/issues/2425/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zaproxy/zaproxy/issues/2425/events","html_url":"https://github.com/zaproxy/zaproxy/issues/2425","id":150158168,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWUxNTAxNTgxNjg=","number":2425,"title":"Change
