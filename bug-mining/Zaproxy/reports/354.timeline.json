to answer ;-)\n\nModifying http header sent to ZAP was not what I expected: I was using ZAP to debug\na web service to see if it returns gzip response when I sent \"Accept-Encoding: gzip\".\nIt took a little time to me to understand that ZAP remove this header and that wasn't\nthe web service fault to not answer with gzipped response.\n\nThe best way would be that ZAP do not modify headers it receive and try to handle the\nresponse.\nThe response panel would show the un gzipped response, a little bit like http://web-sniffer\nwhen you check \"Accept-Encoding: gzip\" option, with details about compression (ex.:\nContent (encoded: 42.23 KiB / decoded: 206.06 KiB). Maybe with tabs: \"Encoded content\"/\"Decoded\ncontent\" inside response panel.\nI presume that's not a little task, so may be adding an option to enable/disable the\nmodifying header feature would a first step.\nWhen disabled, ZAP would display the gzipped response.\n\n```\n\nOriginal issue reported on code.google.com by `franck.arnulfo` on 2012-11-02 11:33:46\n","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zaproxy/zaproxy/issues/comments/108966514/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"zapbot","id":12745184,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNzQ1MTg0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12745184?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zapbot","html_url":"https://github.com/zapbot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zapbot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zapbot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zapbot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zapbot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zapbot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zapbot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zapbot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zapbot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zapbot/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zaproxy/zaproxy/issues/comments/108966521","html_url":"https://github.com/zaproxy/zaproxy/issues/408#issuecomment-108966521","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zaproxy/zaproxy/issues/408","id":108966521,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEwODk2NjUyMQ==","user":{"login":"zapbot","id":12745184,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNzQ1MTg0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12745184?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zapbot","html_url":"https://github.com/zapbot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zapbot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zapbot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zapbot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zapbot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zapbot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zapbot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zapbot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zapbot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zapbot/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-06-04T16:48:33Z","updated_at":"2015-06-04T16:48:33Z","body":"```\nYes, that's not the expected behaviour from an user's point of view, even more if that's\nnot documented in the help pages (or any other place). When I said that's the expected\nbehaviour I said it because it was doing what it was coded for, that is, it was not\na bug.\n\nYes, ZAP shouldn't be changing the requests/responses, unless if explicitly specified\nby the user. I guess that ZAP proxy is removing/changing the \"Accept-Encoding\" request-header\nfield because it allows the scanners (or anything else) to not worry about the encoding\ntransformations.\n\nAs a workaround, to debug the web-service with ZAP, you can use the \"Manual Request\nEditor\"/\"Resend\" dialogues that allow to send requests with the \"Accept-Encoding\" request-header\nfield unchanged.\n\nThe response panel already allows to see the responses un-gzipped (it's done automatically\nwhen the response is gzipped, currently the only encode transformation supported) by\nselecting the \"Split display [...]\" or with the encoded transformations applied (the\nraw response body) by selecting the \"Combined display [...]\".\nI'll add a new view so the raw response body can also be seen in the \"Split display\n[...]\", which would be like the suggested tab \"Encoded content\". The \"Decoded content\"\nwould be the current \"Text\" view.\nI'll add the suggested information (\"Content (encoded: 42.23 KiB / decoded: 206.06\nKiB)\") to those panels (currently it's available some information regarding the length\nof the response in the \"Manual Request Editor\"/\"Resend\" dialogues in the weekly releases).\n\nThe \"only\" things that are missing are the change of the proxy to not modify the \"Accept-Encoding\"\nrequest-header field and the change to the message so the scanners can transparently\nscan the messages without worrying about the encode transformations

doing a pentest I discovered that ZAP was unable to find an existing ExternalRedirect vulnerability.\nafter troubleshooting I discoverde that the original request is set using the Accept-Encoding: gzip header, so when the redirect occurs, the content given back by www.google.it (the site used for testing) is gzipped and the regexes don't work because the content isn't the real one.\n\nChecking inside  the ZAP panel implementation, I saw that the response visualization panel perform the ungzipping of the content while showing it... so everything seems working, but inside the core all plugins contine to working with an encoded content.\n\nThis mean that all the plugins could suffer about this implementation if the original request has the Accept-Encoding header set to gzip and the server supports it.
