But then to make that the Active cert the user has to:\r\n\r\na) Click on the cert in the left column,\r\nb) Click on the username in the right column,\r\nc) Click on the Set Active button\r\n\r\nI'm requesting that when a cert is successfully imported, and they are sent back to the KeyStore tab, you automatically do a) and b) for them so they just have to do step c).\r\n\r\nThis doesn't hurt anything if they don't want to do step c) right now, but makes it MUCH easier if they do.  This should probably take like 5 minutes or less to implement this usability enhancement.\r\n\r\nGiven that #2489 is still open, I have to do this every time I start ZAP up again.
