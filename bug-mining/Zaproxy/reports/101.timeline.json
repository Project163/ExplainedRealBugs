originally I had thought this was about report generation failing, so I envisioned it going here:\nhttps://github.com/zaproxy/zaproxy/blob/develop/src/org/zaproxy/zap/view/widgets/WritableFileChooser.java\n\nHowever, this could have to do with a persisted session failing to grow properly (the HSQL DB), if that's the case we need to catch the condition and tell the user that they need to move their persisted session elsewhere (a disk with more space), else they're in a data loss scenario. What is further unknown at this point is how graceful HSQL is at dealing with full disks, we don't want to cause dialogs to just pop and pop and pop.\nLooking [here ](https://github.com/arteam/hsqldb/blob/aa0a17fc0f4aad19afa42fb5afc46b4e0884601d/src/org/hsqldb/persist/RAFileSimple.java#L112-L126) it's only a warning, which is kind of surprising to me. I would assume that if the DB can't be grown you should see the error over and over again in ZAPs logs...\n\nI guess. At this point more testing is needed to nail down the culprit, conditions, behavior, etc. then we can come up with a plan to address it.\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zaproxy/zaproxy/issues/comments/192188629/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"kingthorin","id":7570458,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc1NzA0NTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7570458?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kingthorin","html_url":"https://github.com/kingthorin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kingthorin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kingthorin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kingthorin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kingthorin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kingthorin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kingthorin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kingthorin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kingthorin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kingthorin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zaproxy/zaproxy/issues/comments/204218841","html_url":"https://github.com/zaproxy/zaproxy/issues/2127#issuecomment-204218841","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zaproxy/zaproxy/issues/2127","id":204218841,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIwNDIxODg0MQ==","user":{"login":"mustafa421","id":13444975,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNDQ0OTc1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13444975?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mustafa421","html_url":"https://github.com/mustafa421","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mustafa421/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mustafa421/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mustafa421/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mustafa421/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mustafa421/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mustafa421/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mustafa421/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mustafa421/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mustafa421/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-04-01T02:31:34Z","updated_at":"2016-04-06T02:57:07Z","body":"@kingthorin I would like to work on this :). I was able to reproduce the error and I noticed you always end up with an IO error regardless of wether you were using the DB. The problem is that the exception is thrown after the user attempts to export the results to a disk w/o available space. As such, it would probably be useful to create a way to check if there is available space prior to exporting. I'd imagine the WritableFileChooser would need to be modified to accommodate this. #2376
