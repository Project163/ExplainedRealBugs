OWASP ZAP User Group: https://groups.google.com/d/topic/zaproxy-users/AlT3gpxale8/discussion\n\n---\n\nZAP shows that the active scanner was skipped but there's no indication why. It should be possible to know, through the GUI and the ZAP API, why an active scanner was skipped.\nThere are several reasons why an active scanner can be skipped, for example:\n- The target technologies were not included in the active scan (e.g. SQL Injection when DB is not selected);\n- Prerequisites of the scanner were not fulfilled (e.g. Possible Username Enumeration when no login URL was defined);\n- There's no reason to run the scanner (e.g. Script Active Scan Rules when there's no Active Rules enabled). \n\nOther than the core changes to show the reason it requires changes to allow scanners to report a custom reason (when using prerequisites) and change the scanners (mostly in add-ons) to specify the reason.\n","closed_by":{"login":"psiinon","id":1081115,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwODExMTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1081115?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/psiinon","html_url":"https://github.com/psiinon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psiinon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psiinon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psiinon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psiinon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psiinon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psiinon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psiinon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psiinon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psiinon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zaproxy/zaproxy/issues/2415/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zaproxy/zaproxy/issues/2415/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
