Run ZAP and configure the spider to use more than one thread;\n2. Spider a website;\n3. Wait it to finish, note that the progress is not 100% (it might be, for example, 95%, 97%, 98%, 99% depending on number of threads and URLs found).\n\nRemarks:\nSince it's caused by a concurrency issue it might require several tries to reproduce.\nThe issue is very problematic/misleading for ZAP API users since the progress is normally used to check if the spider has finished.\n\nZAP Versions:\nVersions >= 2.0.0\n","closed_by":{"login":"thc202","id":4639210,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ2MzkyMTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4639210?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/thc202","html_url":"https://github.com/thc202","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thc202/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thc202/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thc202/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thc202/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thc202/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thc202/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thc202/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thc202/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thc202/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zaproxy/zaproxy/issues/1858/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zaproxy/zaproxy/issues/1858/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
