plans of having this feature in next release or so running it from commandline always\nis a tiresome effort ( I know we can create a shell/desktop shortcut which i have right\nnow) but internal feature would be nice.\n```\n\nOriginal issue reported on code.google.com by `anant@anantshri.info` on 2015-04-14

I have just updated to OWASP ZAP 2.4.2 and was able to connect via Tor by adding `-DsocksProxyHost=127.0.0.1 -DsocksProxyPort=9050` directly into the `zap.sh` script, but ZAP did _not_ connect via Tor when I added the same JVM options to the new \"JVM\" preference window nor did it do so when passing directly from the command line (like `./zap.sh -DsocksProxyHost=127.0.0.1-DsocksProxyPort=9050`).\n\nIn the former case (using the JVM options free form text field from within ZAP and then restarting it), the options simply seemed to be ignored, even though they were written to the `.ZAP_JVM.properties` file. That is, running a `ps -ef | grep java` on my system showed that ZAP was launched without the `-D*` options in the `.ZAP_JVM.properties` file being passed to the JVM at all.\n\nIn the latter case (passing the arguments on the command line to the `zap.sh`) script resulted in an \"unrecognized option\" dialogue in the ZAP GUI after ZAP had launched. I believe this is because the JVM options must be specified before the path to the jar being loaded (`java [ options ] -jar file.jar [ argument...  ]` according to my system's `java` man page), but [the `zap.sh` script for ZAP 2.4.2 places the arguments after the jar, passing them to ZAP itself instead of the JVM](https://github.com/zaproxy/zaproxy/blob/2.4.2/src/zap.sh#L113). Making [this small change](https://github.com/meitar/zaproxy/commit/ce85306d764052d8790e97a1410cf3f586306d57) resolves at least that problem, for me.\n\nFor reference, I am on a Mac OS X 10.10.5 (Yosemite) system.\n","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zaproxy/zaproxy/issues/comments/141381732/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"fabacab","id":18677,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4Njc3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18677?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fabacab","html_url":"https://github.com/fabacab","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fabacab/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fabacab/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fabacab/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fabacab/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fabacab/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fabacab/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fabacab/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fabacab/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fabacab/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":412990182,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50NDEyOTkwMTgy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zaproxy/zaproxy/issues/events/412990182","actor":{"login":"thc202","id":4639210,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ2MzkyMTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4639210?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/thc202","html_url":"https://github.com/thc202","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thc202/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thc202/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thc202/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thc202/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thc202/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thc202/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thc202/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thc202/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thc202/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2015-09-18T08:36:59Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":412990183,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDQxMjk5MDE4Mw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zaproxy/zaproxy/issues/events/412990183","actor":{"login":"thc202","id":4639210,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ2MzkyMTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4639210?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/thc202","html_url":"https://github.com/thc202","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thc202/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thc202/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thc202/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thc202/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thc202/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thc202/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thc202/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thc202/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thc202/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2015-09-18T08:36:59Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":412992168,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDQxMjk5MjE2OA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zaproxy/zaproxy/issues/events/412992168","actor":{"login":"fabacab","id":18677,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4Njc3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18677?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fabacab","html_url":"https://github.com/fabacab","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fabacab/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fabacab/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fabacab/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fabacab/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fabacab/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fabacab/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fabacab/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fabacab/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fabacab/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"ce85306d764052d8790e97a1410cf3f586306d57","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/fabacab/zaproxy/commits/ce85306d764052d8790e97a1410cf3f586306d57","created_at":"2015-09-18T08:39:57Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zaproxy/zaproxy/issues/comments/141409771","html_url":"https://gi

some good news: the [previous error I was reporting](https://github.com/zaproxy/zaproxy/issues/29#issuecomment-108857265) as well as a related issue wherein browsing `http://localhost/` through ZAP returned a similar SOCKS error, has been resolved by an update to the latest JRE (1.8.0_60).\n\nSpecifically, the `zap.sh` script prefers the JVM bundled with the OWASP ZAP distribution. This means when ZAP runs without modifications it uses JRE 1.7.0_79. But by moving that out of the way and then launching ZAP normally, the SOCKS error vanishes, even when testing against web sites hosted by the same machine running the local ZAP proxy.
