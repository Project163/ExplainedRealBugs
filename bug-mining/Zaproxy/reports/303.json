the bug**\r\nThe JSON report output format looks differently where there is only one site and when there are multiple sites. \r\nWhen there is only one site, this is how it looks like:\r\n```\r\n{\r\n    \"@version\": \"2.7.0\",\r\n    \"@generated\": \"Thu, 27 Dec 2018 12:41:32\",\r\n    \"site\": {\r\n        \"@name\": \"http://localhost:3000\",\r\n        \"@host\": \"localhost\",\r\n        \"@port\": \"3000\",\r\n        \"@ssl\": \"false\"\r\n        \r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\nWhen there are multiple sites, the `@site` property is an array - not an object:\r\n```\r\n{\r\n    \"@version\": \"2.7.0\",\r\n    \"@generated\": \"Thu, 27 Dec 2018 12:42:05\",\r\n    \"site\": [\r\n        {\r\n            \"@name\": \"http://other\",\r\n            \"@host\": \"icinga2\",\r\n            \"@port\": \"80\",\r\n            \"@ssl\": \"false\"\r\n        },\r\n        {\r\n            \"@name\": \"http://localhost:3000\",\r\n            \"@host\": \"localhost\",\r\n            \"@port\": \"3000\",\r\n            \"@ssl\": \"false\"\r\n        }\r\n    ]\r\n}\r\n```\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\nSteps to reproduce the behavior:\r\n1. Proxy one site through Zap\r\n2. Generate JSON report\r\n3. Proxy another site through Zap\r\n4. Generate JSON report\r\n\r\nCompare both files\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nA consistent behavior of `@site` - it should always be an array.\r\n\r\n**Software versions**\r\n - ZAP: 2.7.0\r\n - OS: mac/docker\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"psiinon","id":1081115,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwODExMTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1081115?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/psiinon","html_url":"https://github.com/psiinon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psiinon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psiinon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psiinon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psiinon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psiinon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psiinon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psiinon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psiinon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psiinon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zaproxy/zaproxy/issues/5162/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zaproxy/zaproxy/issues/5162/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
