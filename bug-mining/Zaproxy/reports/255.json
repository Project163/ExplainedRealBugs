related to [https://github.com/zaproxy/zaproxy/issues/3512](https://github.com/zaproxy/zaproxy/issues/3512), but maybe more general.\r\n\r\nLet me explain a simple use case:\r\n* python application using ZAP REST API\r\n* this app creates and loads different proxy rules into ZAP: both ZEST and JS (\"Oracle Nashorn\") proxy rules\r\n* each rule performs a specific operation under certain conditions \r\n* the app needs now to know which operations were executed and which ones were not\r\n\r\nIMHO, the simplest solution would be:\r\n* each proxy rule that execute its operation sets a variable \"proxy_rule_name_operation\" to  \"executed\"\r\n* notice that this needs to be done for both kind of rules (ZEST and JS)\r\n* app invokes the ZAP REST API to get the values of those variables \r\n\r\nDiscussion on google group:
