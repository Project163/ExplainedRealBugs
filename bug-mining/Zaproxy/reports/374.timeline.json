<APPLICATION_URL> -c config.tsv -r report.html`\r\n\r\nThe `config.tsv` is generated from this:\r\n```\r\nzap-full-scan.py -j -a -t <APPLICATION_URL> -g current-config.tsv\r\ncat current-config.tsv outofscope.tsv > config.tsv\r\n```\r\nIt's basically the default (with everything on WARN) and then some of those are placed out of scope because they fail for various reasons.\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nUnknown. From #7218 I gather that it's currently doing something that it shouldn't do.\r\n\r\nHowever, from #7206 it also seems deliberate to start throwing errors for unknown scan rule ID's, which is going to cause issues in our CI setup. See #7219 for that.\n\n### Software versions\n\n`:latest` weekly\n\n### Screenshots\n\n_No response_\n\n### Errors from the zap.log file\n\n_No response_\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No
