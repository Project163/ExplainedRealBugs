imported set of urls in zap using API and tried to run the spider using API.  However, the spider is not taking the imported urls as input, only the scanner use it for finding vulnerability.  But, the scanner checks only the url and not processing any Forms inside the given url. \r\n\r\nIf you right click and run the spider from GUI, it is taking the imported urls as input.  \r\n\r\nNote: When i unchecked the \"recurse\" option in GUI and run the spider, it didn't take the imported urls as input.  So i tried to pass different values to recurse parameter in API(like \"yes\",1,true,True..),  but still it didn't do.","closed_by":{"login":"psiinon","id":1081115,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwODExMTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1081115?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/psiinon","html_url":"https://github.com/psiinon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psiinon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psiinon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psiinon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psiinon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psiinon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psiinon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psiinon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psiinon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psiinon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zaproxy/zaproxy/issues/4202/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zaproxy/zaproxy/issues/4202/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
