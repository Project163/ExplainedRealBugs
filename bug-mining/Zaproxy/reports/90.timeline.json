spider to create the display name for the scans using all the\ncomponents of the target and custom configurations, with the following\norder:\n- Context;\n- Just in scope;\n- Start node;\n- Start URL.\n\nSo, for example, if a start node is specified along with a context it\nwill display the context name instead of the start node (which is more\nspecific, narrow target when spidering).\nChange class ExtensionSpider to follow the above rules using a new\nmethod to start the scans, to ensure that all scans use the same display\nname rules (the old method that allows to define the display name is\nstill available but its use is discouraged in favour of using the new\nmethod).\nChange classes ExtensionSpider, SpiderAPI and SpiderDialog to use the\nnew method, for the latter class also remove the creation of the custom\ndisplay name.\n\n---\n\nOld title/message (for the record):\nChange Target display name to use the broadest target component first\n\nChange the method Target.getDisplayName() to check first if there's a\ncontext defined or if the target is \"in scope only\" to use that as the\ndisplay name, only if those are not defined use the start node.

a new option to Spider dialogue (\"Spider Subtree Only\") and a\nparameter to spider ZAP API (\"subtreeOnly\") to allow to spider just a\nsite's subtree. In both cases it's required a URI (manually set or\npreviously accessed), that's used as the subtree to spider. It's only\nused the scheme, host, port and path component of the URI when\nconsidering if a resource found while spidering is under or not the\nspecified subtree. For example, if the seed URI is:\n http://example.com:8080/path/?a=b#c\nit's used only:\n http://example.com:8080/path/\n\nThe spider will exclude any resources found not under the subtree by\nusing a new FetchFilter, HttpPrefixFetchFilter, that allows to filter\nURIs based on a URI prefix, in this use case the subtree URI.\nAdd tests to assert the expected behaviour of HttpPrefixFetchFilter.\nFix
