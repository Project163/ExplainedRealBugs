class ContextPanelUsersSelectComboBox to fix the following user\nselection issues:\n- A user is always selected, even if all users are removed from the\n  table model (a source of the shown users) it would still show one user\n  as selected in the combo box (which means that when used in Forced User\n  panel it would be using the user as the Forced User). The fix is to\n  change the method setSelectedItem(Object) to check for null selection\n  (to set none selected) before checking if the given (null) Object is a\n  User (which would always be false). Also, remove redundant null check,\n  in a following condition, for the same reason;\n- Rename done to selected user not reflected in the selected user, nor\n  is it possible to change that when in the presence of only one user.\n  That happens because the modified user is a new User (but still equal).\n  The fix is to change the method tableChanged(TableModelEvent) to\n  refresh the selected user with the modified user (thus showing the\n  latest changes).\n\nThe method tableChanged(TableModelEvent) was also refactored to use all\nevent types to do the required selection state checks (for example, when\na user is added select it if none is yet selected...) and proper\nnotification of the changes (for example, call fireIntervalAdded(...)\nwhen a user is added, fireIntervalRemoved(...) when removed...).\nAnother change is to use a (new) method, setSelectedItemImpl(User), that\nsets the selected user without doing any validations, since the state of\ncombo box is well known. All internal selection changes are now done\nusing that method.\n\nFix #2090 - Context: Rename User, can't select in Forced User

class UsersListModel (used by ContextPanelUsersSelectComboBox) to\nfix an exception and do proper notification of changes when setting\ncustom users:\n- An ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException is thrown when all users are\n  removed from the table model (source of the shown users), which happens\n  when changing authentication methods with existing users. The exception\n  happened because the UsersTableModel sends a change notification when\n  removing all users which the code in UsersListModel did not handled\n  correctly (it tried to select a user that didn't exist). Issue\n  introduced with changes done in #2143;\n- Changes done to custom users are not notified. Change method\n  setCustomUsers(User[]) to notify of insertion, modification and removal\n  of the custom users.\n- Index returned by getIndexOf(Object) for custom users is not correct.\n  Change the method to return the index of the custom users taking into\n  account the existing table users (which are always before the custom\n  users).\n\nRemove redundant initialisation of instance variable in UsersTableModel.\nExtract the static nested class UsersListModel to ease the unit tests.\nAdd tests to assert the expected behaviour of UsersTableModel,\nUsersListModel and AbstractMultipleOptionsBaseTableModel.\nRelated to #2090 - Context: Rename User, can't select in Forced
