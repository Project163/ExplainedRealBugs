\"Active Scan Input Vectors\" options panel to allow to choose to scan the HTTP headers of all requests, not just the ones that seem to be dynamic (requests that have query parameters and/or a request body).\nRational to allow to choose to scan all pages is that \"non dynamic\" pages might still use the HTTP headers (thus possibly vulnerable).\nSince scanning the headers of all pages significantly increases the time of the scan it will be disabled by default.\nWith this change it would be possible to scan the HTTP headers of more requests of OWASP Benchmark (#1890).\n","closed_by":{"login":"psiinon","id":1081115,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwODExMTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1081115?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/psiinon","html_url":"https://github.com/psiinon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psiinon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psiinon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psiinon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psiinon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psiinon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psiinon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psiinon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psiinon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psiinon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zaproxy/zaproxy/issues/1959/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zaproxy/zaproxy/issues/1959/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
