order to find more pages, before spidering, I want to add my own URLs that can't be found by crawling the web pages. And I want to do this only with the web API (no user interface).\r\n\r\nMy website structure would be like this:\r\n\r\n`main_page`\r\n`main_page/secret.html`\r\n`main_page/more_secrets.html`\r\n\r\n`main_page` has no reference to `secret.html` or `more_secrets.html`\r\n`secret.html` has references to `more_secrets.html`\r\n(by references I mean HTML anchor tags)\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\nI want to manually add `main_page/secret.html` (in ZAP's URL tree) and then use spider on main_page.\r\nSteps to reproduce the behavior:\r\n1. `core/accessUrl` for `main_page/secret.html`\r\n2. `spider/scan` for `main_page`\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nDuring spidering process, I expected that ZAP would request `main_page/secret.html` and process the response.\r\n\r\n**Software versions**\r\n - ZAP: 2.7.0\r\n - OS: Linux\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nIf I use `core/accessUrl` method and then spider from the UI (not the web UI) it will crawl `main_page/secret.html`, process it and add `main_page/more_secrets.html` in URL tree.\r\nIf my explanation is unclear, I can make a script to build the website structure.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zaproxy/zaproxy/issues/5341/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zaproxy/zaproxy/issues/5341/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":2329565309,"node_id":"MDE3OlJlbmFtZWRUaXRsZUV2ZW50MjMyOTU2NTMwOQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zaproxy/zaproxy/issues/events/2329565309","actor":{"login":"thc202","id":4639210,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ2MzkyMTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4639210?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/thc202","html_url":"https://github.com/thc202","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thc202/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thc202/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thc202/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thc202/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thc202/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thc202/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thc202/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thc202/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thc202/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"renamed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-05-09T08:51:10Z","rename":{"from":"API
