If I open up scan progress details and look at the Progress tab for a scan, it is not necessarily the case that the plugins listed are executed in the order they appear.\r\n\r\nFor example, it may look as though the \"Cross Site Scripting (Persistent)\" plugin will be executed before the \"Cross Site Scripting (Persistent) - Prime\" and \"Cross Site Scripting (Persistent) - Spider\" plugins.\r\n\r\nWould it be possible to list the plugins in their order of execution?\r\n\r\nFor additional background, please see  \r\n\r\n
