Below I used bodgeit for the example.\n\nStep 1: docker run --name \"ZAP\" -d -p 8090:8090 -i owasp/zap2docker-stable zap.sh -daemon -port 8090 -host 0.0.0.0 -config api.disablekey=true\n\nStep 2: I use a java app using zap-api-2.4-v10.jar to automated this but I think it's easier to show on the ZAP docker container API UI.\n\nBy default the API sets the contextName parameter which can be left empty.  \nThe default request is not working containing contextName: \nhttp://<0.0.0.0>:8090/JSON/spider/action/scan/?zapapiformat=JSON&url=http%3A%2F%2F192.168.1.154%3A8080%2Fbodgeit%2F&maxChildren=&recurse=&contextName=\n\nReturns: {\"code\":\"does_not_exist\",\"message\":\"Does Not Exist\"}\n\nWhat works (Removed contextName param): \nhttp://<0.0.0.0>:8090/JSON/spider/action/scan/?zapapiformat=JSON&url=http%3A%2F%2Flocalhost%3A8080%2Fbodgeit%2F&maxChildren=&recurse=\n\nReturns: {\"scan\":\"0\"}\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zaproxy/zaproxy/issues/2303/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zaproxy/zaproxy/issues/2303/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zaproxy/zaproxy/issues/comments/334436382","html_url":"https://github.com/zaproxy/zaproxy/issues/2108#issuecomment-334436382","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zaproxy/zaproxy/issues/2108","id":334436382,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMzNDQzNjM4Mg==","user":{"login":"LisinIwan","id":32541142,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyNTQxMTQy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/32541142?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/LisinIwan","html_url":"https://github.com/LisinIwan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LisinIwan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LisinIwan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LisinIwan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LisinIwan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LisinIwan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LisinIwan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LisinIwan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LisinIwan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LisinIwan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-10-05T11:22:48Z","updated_at":"2017-10-05T11:30:08Z","body":"In 2017-10-02 (Weekly-Release) i faced the same Problem:\r\nAlways getting the ERROR-message that \"Default Context\" does not exist. It took me nearly 1 week to figure out what actually caused the error. \r\nFirst of all i tried to modify the Code, the most simple solution was just to comment out the try-catch-block inside the  includeInContext-Method, in the ZapHelper class. \r\nBut i geuss it is not satisfying to modify a plugin yourself, so i was looking further into the  issue and figured out that actually the language Setup of ur PC caused the error. \r\nIn my case (Germany) i could also set the \r\nprivate static final String ZAP_DEFAULT_CONTEXT_NAME = \"Default Context\"; to \r\nprivate static final String ZAP_DEFAULT_CONTEXT_NAME = \"Standard-Kontext\"; inside the ZapHelper class and it would fix the Problem ... but also switching ur PC to english would have the same result.\r\n\r\nDont wanna go to much into the Detail, but i geuss Zap takes your local language Settings and therefor \r\nthe api-communication differs based on those Settings.\r\n\r\nShort and simple Change the language on your Computer to english and it could solve your Problem, at least it did help me.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zaproxy/zaproxy/issues/comments/334436382/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"LisinIwan","id":32541142,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyNTQxMTQy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/32541142?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/LisinIwan","html_url":"https://github.com/LisinIwan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LisinIwan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LisinIwan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LisinIwan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LisinIwan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LisinIwan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LisinIwan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LisinIwan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LisinIwan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LisinIwan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":2759679555,"node_id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDI3NTk2Nzk1NTU=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zaproxy/zaproxy/issues/events/2759679555","actor":{"login":"kingthorin","id":7570458,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc1NzA0NTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7570458?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kingthorin","html_url":"https://github.com/kingthorin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kingthorin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kingthorin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kingthorin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kingthorin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kingthorin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kingthorin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kingthorin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kingthorin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kingthorin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-10-31T12:55:36Z","label":{"name":"historic","color":"c2e0c6"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zaproxy/zaproxy/issues/comments/581042363","html_url":"https://github.com/zaproxy/zaproxy/issues/2108#issuecomment-581042363","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zaproxy/zaproxy/issues/2108","id":581042363,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU4MTA0MjM2Mw==","user":{"login":"lock[bot]","id":33595554,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90MzM1OTU1NTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/6672?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lock%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/lock","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lock%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lock%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lock%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lock%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lock%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lock%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lock%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lock%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lock%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-02-01T15:49:45Z","updated_at":"2020-02-01T15:49:45Z","body":"This thread has been automatically locked since there has not been any recent activity after it was closed.
