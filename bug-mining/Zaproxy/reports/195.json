asked a question in the zap proxy google group and was instructed to raise an issue. The question was posted here: https://groups.google.com/forum/?utm_medium=email&utm_source=footer#!msg/zaproxy-users/BRUJPXWp6Z8/QJ8D_h-CAwAJ\r\n\r\nThe messages view of the core component enables you to retrieve a list of request-response pairs, but rather than giving you the ability to start at a certain id, it starts searching at the n-th request.\r\n\r\n**Example:**\r\n\r\nAssume I have a request-response history with the following identifiers: 1,2,5,6,10,20,21,22,23\r\n\r\nI can inspect the details of the request-response pair with id=5 using /core/view/message/?id=5&theOtherParameters\r\n\r\nI **cannot** get the details of request-response pairs 5,6 and 10 by doing this: /core/view/messages/?start=5&count=3&theOtherParameters. This will return the details of request-response pair 10,20 and 21. Where the request-response pair with id=10 is the 5th one in my history.\r\n\r\nIt doesn't make a whole lot of sense to me. Sure, if you only have a 100 requests you can kinda count where you want to start. But when you have several 1000 of requests it seems impossible to extract the set of requests you want.\r\n\r\n\r\nWould you consider adding an endpoint that offers the functionality I'm looking for?","closed_by":{"login":"psiinon","id":1081115,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwODExMTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1081115?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/psiinon","html_url":"https://github.com/psiinon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psiinon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psiinon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psiinon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psiinon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psiinon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psiinon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psiinon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psiinon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psiinon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zaproxy/zaproxy/issues/3514/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zaproxy/zaproxy/issues/3514/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
