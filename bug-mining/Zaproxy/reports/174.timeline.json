allow you to declare [HEALTHCHECK](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#healthcheck) command. It would be great to add this command to the docker image, and report Zap as healthy when it complete loading. This could be useful when using Zap in CI environment (using `docker-compose`), and waiting to Zap to complete loading before starting the tests. The only problem is how we detect that Zap complete loading - I think the API is responsive before Zap complete loading.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zaproxy/zaproxy/issues/3649/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zaproxy/zaproxy/issues/3649/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":2759664360,"node_id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDI3NTk2NjQzNjA=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zaproxy/zaproxy/issues/events/2759664360","actor":{"login":"kingthorin","id":7570458,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc1NzA0NTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7570458?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kingthorin","html_url":"https://github.com/kingthorin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kingthorin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kingthorin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kingthorin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kingthorin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kingthorin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kingthorin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kingthorin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kingthorin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kingthorin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-10-31T12:51:14Z","label":{"name":"historic","color":"c2e0c6"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zaproxy/zaproxy/issues/comments/581103388","html_url":"https://github.com/zaproxy/zaproxy/issues/3297#issuecomment-581103388","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zaproxy/zaproxy/issues/3297","id":581103388,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU4MTEwMzM4OA==","user":{"login":"lock[bot]","id":33595554,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90MzM1OTU1NTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/6672?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lock%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/lock","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lock%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lock%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lock%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lock%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lock%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lock%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lock%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lock%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lock%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-02-02T06:21:19Z","updated_at":"2020-02-02T06:21:19Z","body":"This thread has been automatically locked since there has not been any recent activity after it was closed.
