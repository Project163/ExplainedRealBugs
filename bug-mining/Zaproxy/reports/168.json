Windows 7 professional Edition 32 - bit\r\nZAP_VERSION: ZAP_2.5.0_Cross_Platform\r\nThe .ZAP_JVM.properties exists.\r\n\r\nWhen I start zap using zap.bat in windows command line, the shell can't find .ZAP_JVM.properties correctly. The \"if exist\" statement which use %HOMEPATH% variable is False. I found the value of %HOMEPATH% is something like \\Users\\username which has not contain the drive letter, and the \"if exist\" statement need a complete path like C:\\Users\\username to use. I think the shell should use %USERPROFILE% or %HOMEDRIVE%%HOMEPATH% instead of %HOMEPATH% to find .ZAP_JVM.properties. When I do like this, the shell start zap with the given jvm options in property file correctly.\r\n\r\nReference:\r\n[https://www.microsoft.com/resources/documentation/windows/xp/all/proddocs/en-us/ntcmds_shelloverview.mspx?mfr=true](https://www.microsoft.com/resources/documentation/windows/xp/all/proddocs/en-us/ntcmds_shelloverview.mspx?mfr=true)","closed_by":{"login":"kingthorin","id":7570458,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc1NzA0NTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7570458?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kingthorin","html_url":"https://github.com/kingthorin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kingthorin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kingthorin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kingthorin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kingthorin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kingthorin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kingthorin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kingthorin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kingthorin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kingthorin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zaproxy/zaproxy/issues/3211/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zaproxy/zaproxy/issues/3211/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
