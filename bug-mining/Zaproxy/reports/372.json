the bug**\r\nAfter doing scans and collecting info on site, it detected 'Application Error Disclosure' (6).  Upon expanding and clicking on a link (javascript file, can't tell how large), it's instantly freezes and nothing else can be done (it may recover after a few minutes wait).  In other parts of app, I've seen the \"Very large response body (xxx bytes) - switch views...\" warning, but not in this situation.  I have to do a 'killall java' to exit the app and restart.  \r\n\r\nOn occasion, it will recover after a few minutes, but the app moves slow so I just restart it. When it does recover, the response is unintelligible (see screenshot) and navigating around is slow. \r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\nSteps to reproduce the behavior:\r\n1. Have JS file (size?) in Alert, Application Error Disclosure \r\n2. Click on link.\r\n3. App freezes instantly or moves slow.\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nTo see the Request and Response data of the alert.\r\n\r\n**Screenshots**\r\n##Click on the 'GET:https://xx/build/js/app.js?v=...\r\n![AED-js](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/57641147/72003916-3db64b80-31ff-11ea-904c-4da4c5f01c55.jpg)\r\n##Screen freezes, switching desktop and back shows gray app\r\n![goesGray](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/57641147/72003925-4149d280-31ff-11ea-8989-6269bf75827c.PNG)\r\n##If it does recover, Response window looks like\r\n![if-it-does-recover](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/57641147/72004073-7f46f680-31ff-11ea-9f6e-623b349c56ab.PNG)\r\n\r\n\r\n**Software versions**\r\n - ZAP: 2.8.1\r\n - OS: BlackArch 5.4.6 x86_64\r\n - Java: openjdk 13.0.1\r\n - Hardware:  Happens on both VirtualBox and HD install on laptop.\r\n\r\n**Errors from the zap.log file**\r\nWill update, don't have currently.\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nAdd any other context about the problem here.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"psiinon","id":1081115,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwODExMTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1081115?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/psiinon","html_url":"https://github.com/psiinon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psiinon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psiinon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psiinon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psiinon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psiinon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psiinon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psiinon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psiinon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psiinon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zaproxy/zaproxy/issues/5791/reactions","total_count":6,"+1":6,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zaproxy/zaproxy/issues/5791/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
