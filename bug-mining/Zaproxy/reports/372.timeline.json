the bug**\r\nWhen the scan of a very large site is finished and one walks through the Alerts URLS to validate for False Positives. ZAP stops responding completely and doesn't accept any input from the keyboard nor mouse. If one waits about 5 minutes ZAP seems to recover and you can make a single click which then hangs ZAP again for 5 minutes. In ProcMon64 I see that the session receives a .lck extension (guessing this means Lock). \r\nThis also happened when ZAP gave back control and I tried to run a HTML report.\r\n\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\nSteps to reproduce the behavior:\r\n- Run a giant scan of a huge website returning giant JavaScripts (boostrap)\r\n- When finished walk through the Alerts\r\n- When clicking on one of the giant JavaScript URLS ZAP will go into a kind of LOCK mode and no longer respond to user input.\r\n- Click on Report HTML\r\n- ZAP no longer responds to user input.\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\n- It would be nice if there were some kind of Visual feedback that ZAP was in LOCK mode.\r\n-- This way the user doesn't need to panic and try to shut down ZAP loosing all their scan data.\r\n- It would be nice if the keyboard and mouse interrupted the LOCK mode by stopping the current processing and gave control back to the user.  \r\n-- Lock conditions can be very intimidating for users, especially new users who might feel they broke something. \r\n\r\n**Screenshots**\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10052587/74362055-44b91680-4dc8-11ea-8080-f1d67a94fc00.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n**Software versions**\r\n - ZAP: 2.9\r\n - Add-on:  Passive Scanning Rules removed for this scan\r\n[2020-02-12_InstalledAddOns_NoPassiveScanning.csv.txt](https://github.com/zaproxy/zaproxy/files/4193958/2020-02-12_InstalledAddOns_NoPassiveScanning.csv.txt)\r\n\r\n - OS: Windows 10 19.09\r\n - Java:  java -version\r\nopenjdk version \"13.0.2\" 2020-01-15\r\nOpenJDK Runtime Environment (build 13.0.2+9)\r\nOpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM (build 13.0.2+9, mixed mode, sharing)\r\n - Browser: Firefox 73\r\n\r\n**Errors from the zap.log file**\r\nSanitized\r\n[2020-02-12_BugLocked_zap.log](https://github.com/zaproxy/zaproxy/files/4193986/2020-02-12_BugLocked_zap.log)\r\n\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\n\r\nThe screenshot shows .lck and .data when the system is locked I only see .lck and nothing else.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zaproxy/zaproxy/issues/5862/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zaproxy/zaproxy/issues/5862/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zaproxy/zaproxy/issues/comments/585340305","html_url":"https://github.com/zaproxy/zaproxy/issues/5791#issuecomment-585340305","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zaproxy/zaproxy/issues/5791","id":585340305,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU4NTM0MDMwNQ==","user":{"login":"globeone","id":10052587,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMDUyNTg3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10052587?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/globeone","html_url":"https://github.com/globeone","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/globeone/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/globeone/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/globeone/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/globeone/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/globeone/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/globeone/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/globeone/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/globeone/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/globeone/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-02-12T18:09:57Z","updated_at":"2020-02-12T18:09:57Z","body":"Would you like me to repost the Log file from #5862 to this bug?

your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**\r\n1) On sites with huge .js files the search might take too long and I always have to kill the ZAP because it is unresponsive during long searches. As many modern sites use bundled huge js files, this makes searches unusable and forces me more and more to develop my own ZAP clone without such trivial issues.\r\n2) Search takes only 25% of 4 core CPU.\r\n3) It seems that each huge .js file occurrence is searched again and again. \r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\n1) Search should be fully asynchronous. User should be able to use the UI during search in huge .js webapps.. ZAP should have \"stop search\" button.\r\n2) Search is multithreaded\r\n3) Huge files are hashed. If DB contains already searched file hash, the search is not performed on the huge file again.\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\nI always have to save my session beforehand searches, then kill the ZAP if it takes too long during searches.\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nTo reproduce use any web app which loads huge .js files\r\n\r\n**Would you like to help implementing this feature?**\r\nI don't know how to code in Java.\r\n\r\nVersion:\r\nD-2020-06-08 and all previous major versions like 2.9 2.8. 2.7\r\n\r\nP.S.

the bug**\r\nThe Zap UI freezes if I click any expanded content within the **Alerts** window.\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\nSteps to reproduce the behavior:\r\n1. Run **Attack** in **Standard Mode** on small website running on my local workstation.\r\n2. Scan completes.\r\n3. Click **Alerts** button.  This displays four alerts.\r\n4. Expand one of the nodes by clicking the arrow icon.  This reveals three sub-entries.  UI is still responsive at this point.  I can click other tabs and back to **Alerts**.\r\n5. Select one of the sub-entries.  Details display in right-hand side.  But the entire UI is unresponsive.\r\n6. Perform **force quit** on Zap.\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nI expected the UI to continue to be responsive.\r\n\r\n**Screenshots**\r\nThe last thing I see before a freeze.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1967533/51096612-7e0cf600-1772-11e9-9b75-147c9eaf40fe.png)\r\n\r\n**Software versions**\r\n - ZAP: `7.2.0`\r\n - Add-on: None that I know of.\r\n - OS: macOS `10.12.6`\r\n - Java: `1.8.0_65`\r\n - Browser: Using **QuickStart**.\r\n\r\n**Errors from the zap.log file**\r\nI tailed `zap.log` during my navigation into the **Alerts** menu.  No entries are added.  This log seems to grow mostly during a test.\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\n* CPU utilization for Zap hovers at 100% (out of 400% for a quad-core) during the freeze.\r\n* I **force quit** to stop it.\r\n* Once (out of seven times) the problem didn't immediately happen.  I was able to navigate within the **Alert** panel for about 10 seconds before the UI froze.\r\n* No other Zap panels give me this issue.\r\n* Behavior is the same before and after updating all plugins.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zaproxy/zaproxy/issues/5188/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zaproxy/zaproxy/issues/5188/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":3824125521,"node_id":"MDE3OkRlbWlsZXN0b25lZEV2ZW50MzgyNDEyNTUyMQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zaproxy/zaproxy/issues/events/3824125521","actor":{"login":"psiinon","id":1081115,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwODExMTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1081115?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/psiinon","html_url":"https://github.com/psiinon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psiinon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psiinon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psiinon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psiinon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psiinon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psiinon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psiinon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psiinon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psiinon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"demilestoned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-09-30T11:58:56Z","milestone":{"title":"2.10.0"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3824125523,"node_id":"MDE1Ok1pbGVzdG9uZWRFdmVudDM4MjQxMjU1MjM=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zaproxy/zaproxy/issues/events/3824125523","actor":{"login":"psiinon","id":1081115,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwODExMTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1081115?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/psiinon","html_url":"https://github.com/psiinon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psiinon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psiinon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psiinon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psiinon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psiinon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psiinon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psiinon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psiinon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psiinon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"milestoned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-09-30T11:58:56Z","milestone":{"title":"2.11.0"},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
