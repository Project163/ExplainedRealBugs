the layout management to class WorkbenchPanel which has all the\ninformation necessary to keep its layouts/options in the expected state.\n\nFollowing more detailed explanation of the changes done to each class:\n- MenuToolsControl, notify the MainFrame class that the options were\n  changed, to apply the view options;\n- ExtensionLoader, remove direct manipulation of the tabbed panels of\n  WorkbenchPanel class and remove code related to layout logic, the\n  addition and removal of panels are done through methods of\n  WorkbenchPanel class;\n- OptionsParamView:\n  - Add method to read and to persist the position of the response\n    panel (logic/code moved from MessagePanelsPositionController);\n  - Remove the access/change of the WorkbenchPanel when Show Tab Names\n    option is changed, that's now done by MainFrame when applying the\n    view options;\n- OptionsViewPanel, add a new option to allow to change the position of\n  the response panel, so that's also available when the main tool bar is\n  not visible;\n- MainFrame:\n  - Move the layout buttons from MainToolbarPanel to this class, to\n    avoid the circular dependency between MainToolbarPanel and MainFrame,\n    with this change MainToolbarPanel no longer needs to call the\n    MainFrame when the options are changed. Also, moved the response\n    panel position buttons from class MessagePanelsPositionController.\n    MainFrame adds the buttons to the MainToolbarPanel when created and\n    takes care to set the buttons enabled when the options are changed;\n  - Add a method that applies the view options, visibility of the main\n    tool bar, the layout and response panel position of the workbench\n    panel and if the tabs should display the panels' names. It takes care\n    to set the state of the options to WorkbenchPanel and the state of\n    the buttons added to the main tool bar;\n  - Add other methods that control the options previously mentioned, to\n    keep the state of the main tool bar buttons and workbench panel in\n    sync.\n- TabbedPanel, change to use ComponentMaximiser and\n  ComponentMaximiserMouseListener;\n- View:\n  - Change to use the new methods of MainFrame and WorkbenchPanel,\n    instead of accessing/manipulating  directly the components of the\n    WorkbenchPanel class;\n  - Deprecated methods and constants used to change the layout of the\n    WorkbenchPanel, that's done through the MainFrame class;\n- WorkbenchPanel:\n  - Move all layout logic done in MessagePanelsPositionController to\n    the class, to have, in all cases, the correct layout/options applied;\n  - Add a JavaDoc comment to discourage direct manipulation of the\n    tabbed panels, the changes might be lost when changing layouts;\n  - Expose helper methods to change the state of the (tabbed) panels,\n    called by MainFrame and View, instead of changing them directly;\n  - Add enum PanelType to define the type of the panels added,\n    replaces, along with add/remove methods, the direct manipulation of\n    the tabbed panels;\n  - Add enums Layout and ResponsePanelPosition, to define the layouts\n    and response panel positions supported;\n- GuiBootstrap, remove the statement that was setting the layout to the\n  View, no longer needed, MainFrame already takes care to read and apply\n  its (and child components) view options;\n- ComponentMaximiser, extracted from TabbedPanel, helper class to\n  maximise a component;\n- ComponentMaximiserMouseListener, extracted from TabbedPanel, helper\n  class to maximise a component when the component is clicked twice;\n- MainToolbarPanel:\n  - As mentioned previously, some of the buttons were moved to\n    MainFrame class;\n  - Deprecate method that set the layout, no longer used;\n- MessagePanelsPositionController, remove all code and deprecate the\n  class, the position of the response panel is done by WorkbenchPanel\n  class.\n- TabbedPanel2:\n  - Deprecate the method clone(TabbedPanel2), no longer used and the\n    implementation is not correct;\n  - Change method setVisible(Component, boolean) to keep the hideable\n    state of the panel when adding it, otherwise it would be possible to\n    close it even if it shouldn't;\n  - Change method addTab(String, Icon, Component, boolean, boolean,\n    int):\n    - To add the panel to the list of removed panels if it's visible,\n      otherwise it would be shown in the green plus menu even if visible;\n    - Ensure that a tab is always selected, client code no longer needs\n      to do that;\n  - Override removeAll() to update the internal list that tracks which\n    panels are visible and to update the green plus menu;\n  - Add methods to obtain and set the visible panels and obtain all\n    panels, so that the visible state of the panels can be applied to\n    other layouts.\n\nFix #2357 - Inconsistencies while changing between panel layouts\nFix #2358 - ZAP fails to start in \"Full Layout\"\nFix #2359 - Show Tab Names option not applied to Response tab\nFix #2373 - Show Tab not working correctly in Full Layout for\nnon-information tabs\nFix #2374 - Unable to change response tab position without main tool
