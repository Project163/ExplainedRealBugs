to reproduce, create a new session and one context, run one scan on a large site/app. The session file should be roughly 10.5GB and there will be around 200,000 records in the `HISTORY` table.\n\nWhen closing ZAP, it will run a delete to try to delete all records of a certain HISTTYPE at once, this will result in a \n\n`org.hsqldb.HsqlException: java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: Java heap space`\n\nZAP will fail to close, the session has a chance of getting corrupted but the regardless of a corrupted session, zap ends in an unclean state.\n","closed_by":{"login":"kingthorin","id":7570458,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc1NzA0NTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7570458?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kingthorin","html_url":"https://github.com/kingthorin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kingthorin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kingthorin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kingthorin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kingthorin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kingthorin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kingthorin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kingthorin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kingthorin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kingthorin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zaproxy/zaproxy/issues/2836/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zaproxy/zaproxy/issues/2836/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
