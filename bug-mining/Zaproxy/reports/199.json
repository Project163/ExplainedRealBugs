Write an extension for ZAP\n2. Register your extension to startup when ZAP starts\n3. Construct code that produces an exception during initialization\n\nWhat is the expected output? What do you see instead?\nExpected: At least a log message with the exception being shown \nInstead:  Nothing, besides that the extension is not loaded and there is no indication\nwhy...\n\nWhat version of the product are you using? On what operating system?\nJava 7 on OS X with ZAP 2.0.0\n\nPlease provide any additional information below.\nThe code which suppresses the exception being shown is in org.zaproxy.zap.control.AddOnLoader.java,\nLine 460: logger.debug(e.getMessage(), e);\n\nIt is written there that: //Often not an error\nbut since the debug-stream is usually not displayed in the console and redirecting\nthe exceptions to debug there effectively supresses ALL exceptions occuring in extensions\nduring initialization - which could be potentially dangerous. \n\n```\n\nOriginal issue reported on code.google.com by `marcel.kulicke` on 2013-04-22 12:17:35\n","closed_by":{"login":"psiinon","id":1081115,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwODExMTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1081115?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/psiinon","html_url":"https://github.com/psiinon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psiinon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psiinon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psiinon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psiinon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psiinon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psiinon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psiinon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psiinon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psiinon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zaproxy/zaproxy/issues/649/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zaproxy/zaproxy/issues/649/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
