the bug**\r\nManaging message tags with the \"Manage Tags...\" dialog in Search view does not affect message tags in History view. This might not be a bug, but actually just a missing feature, not sure though.\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\n1. find message in \"Search\" tab\r\n2. got to \"Manage Tags\"\r\n3. add a new tag and finish the dialogue\r\n4. there is no new tag in the tag column of search view. This will appear if the search is repeated. The tag does not appear in the history view at all\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nIt is expected for a tag added in Search to affect the History view and be persisted in history and the ZAP session.\r\n\r\n**Software versions**\r\n - ZAP: w2018-05-14\r\n - Add-on: Search is part of the core, right?\r\n - OS: OSX 10.13.4\r\n - Java: 1.8.0_152\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"kingthorin","id":7570458,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc1NzA0NTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7570458?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kingthorin","html_url":"https://github.com/kingthorin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kingthorin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kingthorin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kingthorin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kingthorin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kingthorin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kingthorin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kingthorin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kingthorin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kingthorin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zaproxy/zaproxy/issues/4671/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zaproxy/zaproxy/issues/4671/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
