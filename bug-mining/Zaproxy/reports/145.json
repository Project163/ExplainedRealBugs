to reproduce the bug.\nDownload the latest weekly release of ZAP (I used the 2016-10-10 one)\n1- In a web browser (which is configured to the latest ZAP), visit http://genius.com/login and notice how the web page is loaded (the web page will be loaded correctly)\n\n2- Close the browser, load any Zest proxy rule to the latest ZAP, open the web browser and visit http://genius.com/login\n\n3- You will noticed that the web page is loaded incorrectly, in particular the styling of the page gets messed up. This can severely affect Selenium tests utilizing ZAP and Zest proxy rules.\n\nI noticed that the issue is also there in ZAP 2.5.
