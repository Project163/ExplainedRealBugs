the bug**\r\nWhen trying to enable scripts(httpsender, selenium...) via the REST API , the target script does not get enabled. Testing via a local desktop client using the API produces the same result as it does when using a Docker image with your custom ZAP scripts + config.xml imported. When using a local desktop instance API I see the same activity there with selenium or httpsender scripts not being enabled UNLESS i click on the + to show the scripts tab next to the \"Sites\" tab. Then i can enable it via the REST API. \r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\nSteps to reproduce the behavior:\r\n1. Spin up a local desktop instance of ZAP\r\n2. Config the REST API to allow access and control\r\n3. Be sure to have a Selenium, Httpsender, ... script available within ZAP gui\r\n3. Use a API client to GET http://zap/JSON/script/action/enable/?scriptName=targetScript\r\n4. You should receive a `Result: \"OK\"`\r\n5. Now navigate back to ZAP Gui and click the \"+\" Tab next to the \"Sites\" tab and select \"Scripts\"\r\n6. You should now be able to confirm the targetScript was not enabled.\r\n7. Now that we have the scripts tab showing, Send the request again to enable the script. You will get the same `Result: \"OK\"` response but this time the **script will indeed be enabled.**\r\n8. **The \"Scripts\" tab must be enabled for control of the script via REST API. This creates issues when trying to drive your scan from the REST API alone.**\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nScript is enabled without any actions within the GUI\r\n\r\n\r\n**Software versions**\r\n - ZAP: 2.9.0\r\n\r\n - OS: Windows 10, Windows server 2016, Docker images FROM Focal Fossa (Ubuntu 20.04 LTS)\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"psiinon","id":1081115,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwODExMTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1081115?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/psiinon","html_url":"https://github.com/psiinon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psiinon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psiinon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psiinon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psiinon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psiinon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psiinon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psiinon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psiinon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psiinon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zaproxy/zaproxy/issues/6008/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zaproxy/zaproxy/issues/6008/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
