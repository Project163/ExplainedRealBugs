class CustomScanDialog to obtain the scan policy configured in\nthe Policy tab when \"advanced options\" is enabled. Move Policy tab\nrelated code to a nested class as it makes it easier to use (its also\nresponsible to update the category panels with the selected scan policy,\nensuring that the changes done in those panels are reflected in the\nselected scan policy).\nChange class PolicyAllCategoryPanel to allow interested parties to be\nnotified of changes in the selected scan policy and to reset/reload the\npolicies and select a scan policy (requirements per above changes).\nIssue introduced/revealed with the changes done in #2148 (for issue\n#2112), since the scan policies no longer share the Plugin instances\n\n(therefore the scan policy being obtained in the save method would not\nhave the changes done in the Policy tab).\n\nIssue reported by @kingthorin, please,
