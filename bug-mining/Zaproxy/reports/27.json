Run ZAP with \"Active scanner rules\" version 18;\n2. In the \"Scan Policy\" dialogue for \"Default Policy\" select \"Injection\" panel and disable \"Cross Site Scripting (Persistent) - Prime\" (\"Threshold\" to \"OFF\"), note that the other XSS persistent scanners were also disabled. Save the changes;\n3. Open the dialogue again, select \"Injection\" panel and enable \"Cross Site Scripting (Persistent)\", note that its dependencies (XSS Prime and Spider) were not enabled.\n\nRemarks:\nIf the active scan is run it will never finish because the XSS scanner has unfulfilled dependencies (regression #377).\n\nZAP Versions:\nVersions >= 2.4.0\n","closed_by":{"login":"thc202","id":4639210,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ2MzkyMTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4639210?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/thc202","html_url":"https://github.com/thc202","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thc202/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thc202/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thc202/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thc202/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thc202/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thc202/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thc202/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thc202/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thc202/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zaproxy/zaproxy/issues/1785/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zaproxy/zaproxy/issues/1785/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
