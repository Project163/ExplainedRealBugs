the idea was for the mode to only apply to the UI.\nWith the introduction of the Attack mode (in 2.4) this no longer makes any sense at\nall.\nWe should change ZAP so that the mode does apply to the API, ideally in common code.\nWe should also add the ability to change mode via the API.\nNote that at some point the mode should change to apply to the session rather than\nglobally.\n```\n\nOriginal
