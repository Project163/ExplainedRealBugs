y":"**Describe the bug**\r\nWhen using the Fuzzer to brute force a string in a request (such as a password) while making use of the timing throttle, the requests get slower and slower over time.\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\n1. Set up a fuzz on a string in a request. Payload is usually a list of strings, but it doesn't matter.\r\n2. Use the timing and throttling controls to set 1-5 threads, and a timing of 250ms.\r\n3. Start the fuzzer.\r\n4. The attack will start off fast but very quickly drop off in speed, far far beyond the manual timing set in the control.\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nThe timing between requests should stay constant at the setting provided by the user.\r\n\r\n**Software versions**\r\nZAP 2.8.1\r\nOS: Linux 64bit\r\nOpenJDK 1.8.0_232\r\nFirefox 70\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nThe timings get progressively worse (despite the site itself responding in a relatively constant speed) which makes me think that whatever is computing the timing per thread is periodically increasing the indicated timing (250ms) in additive fashion.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"kingthorin","id":7570458,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc1NzA0NTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7570458?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kingthorin","html_url":"https://github.com/kingthorin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kingthorin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kingthorin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kingthorin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kingthorin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kingthorin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kingthorin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kingthorin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kingthorin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kingthorin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zaproxy/zaproxy/issues/5701/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zaproxy/zaproxy/issues/5701/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
