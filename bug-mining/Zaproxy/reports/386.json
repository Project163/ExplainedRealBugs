This the default content type for the Spring framework's Spring Data REST project.\r\n\r\nI was hoping that this can be treated similarly to https://github.com/zaproxy/zaproxy/issues/5121 , i.e. add this content type to the list of expected types in https://github.com/zaproxy/zaproxy/blob/main/docker/scripts/scripts/httpsender/Alert_on_Unexpected_Content_Types.js that occured in PR https://github.com/zaproxy/zaproxy/pull/5233\n\n### Steps to reproduce the behavior\n\nExecute the zap-api-scan.py script using the owasp/zap2docker-stable against a Spring Data REST application.\r\n\r\nReview the generated report, and you'll see hundreds of alerts for \"Unexpected Content-Type was returned\" generated by plugin \t100001\r\n\n\n### Expected behavior\n\napplication/hal+json should be an acceptable content type\n\n### Software versions\n\nZAP 2.12.0\r\nzap2docker-stable 2.12.0\n\n### Screenshots\n\n_No response_\n\n### Errors from the zap.log file\n\n_No response_\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_\n\n### Would you like to help fix this issue?\n\n- [X] Yes","closed_by":{"login":"kingthorin","id":7570458,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc1NzA0NTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7570458?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kingthorin","html_url":"https://github.com/kingthorin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kingthorin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kingthorin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kingthorin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kingthorin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kingthorin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kingthorin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kingthorin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kingthorin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kingthorin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zaproxy/zaproxy/issues/7677/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zaproxy/zaproxy/issues/7677/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
