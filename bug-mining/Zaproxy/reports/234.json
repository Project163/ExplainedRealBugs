zap team,\n\nThank you very much for making this useful tool.\n\nI identified another bug while I was verifying the fix of bug #2153.\n\nSteps to reproduce:\n\n1) Put this php script to http://localhost/test.php\n\n[test.php.txt](https://github.com/zaproxy/zaproxy/files/273209/test.php.txt)\n\n2) Submit this form through ZAP.\n\n[posttest.html.txt](https://github.com/zaproxy/zaproxy/files/273211/posttest.html.txt)\n\n3) Active Scan to history previous 2) request.(to get simple example, Active Scan Policy:Cross Site Scripting(Reflected)=Default, other=OFF)\n\nI confirmed that the bug #2153 is fixed in zaproxy-w2016-05-16. (Thank you!!!)\n\nBut, I've found other bug.\n\nIn 'Alerts' tab, a XSS found in result. But only this case is detected.\n\n[case1.txt](https://github.com/zaproxy/zaproxy/files/273224/case1.txt)\n\nActually, there is other XSS in scan history.These case is not in detect result.\n\n[case2-5.txt](https://github.com/zaproxy/zaproxy/files/273226/case2-5.txt)\n\nIs these results shuld be in 'Alerts' tab and 'HTML Report' like case1?\n\n(Because an array value from HTML form has different mean by order in array.\nex. param[0]: name , param[1]: address, param[2]: phone number...\nSo, only param[0] is in scan result, causes miss the XSS in param[1],param[2]...)\n\nRegards.\n","closed_by":{"login":"psiinon","id":1081115,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwODExMTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1081115?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/psiinon","html_url":"https://github.com/psiinon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psiinon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psiinon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psiinon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psiinon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psiinon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psiinon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psiinon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psiinon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psiinon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zaproxy/zaproxy/issues/2496/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zaproxy/zaproxy/issues/2496/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
