Describe the bug:\n\nLink text is practically unreadable in the \"Flat Darcula\" theme.\n\nFor example in the addons pane.\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5f3f87fe-e824-463b-84bd-5cbd97939a99)\n\n\n### Steps to reproduce the behavior:\n\n1. Change theme to \"Flat Darcula\"\n2. Open addon manager window\n\n### Expected behavior:\n\nIdeally the flat dark themes would switch up the visited and unvisited link colors to something more legible. Probably just a lighter blue and purple.\n\nMaybe something like `#5ca3f3` for the blue and `#bb83ff` for the purple. \n\n### Software versions:\n\n```\nZAP\nVersion: 2.15.0\n\nInstalled Add-ons: [[id=alertFilters, version=22.0.0],\n[id=ascanrules, version=69.0.0], [id=authhelper,\nversion=0.16.0], [id=automation, version=0.43.0],\n[id=bruteforce, version=16.0.0], [id=callhome,\nversion=0.13.0], [id=commonlib, version=1.28.0],\n[id=custompayloads, version=0.13.0], [id=database,\nversion=0.6.0], [id=diff, version=16.0.0],\n[id=directorylistv1, version=8.0.0], [id=domxss,\nversion=19.0.0], [id=encoder, version=1.5.0], [id=exim,\nversion=0.12.0], [id=formhandler, version=6.6.0], [id=fuzz,\nversion=13.14.0], [id=gettingStarted, version=18.0.0],\n[id=graaljs, version=0.8.0], [id=graphql, version=0.25.0],\n[id=help, version=18.0.0], [id=hud, version=0.19.0],\n[id=invoke, version=15.0.0], [id=network, version=0.18.0],\n[id=oast, version=0.20.0], [id=onlineMenu, version=13.0.0],\n[id=openapi, version=43.0.0], [id=postman, version=0.4.0],\n[id=pscan, version=0.0.1], [id=pscanrules, version=61.0.0],\n[id=quickstart, version=50.0.0], [id=replacer,\nversion=19.0.0], [id=reports, version=0.34.0],\n[id=requester, version=7.7.0], [id=retest, version=0.10.0],\n[id=retire, version=0.42.0], [id=reveal, version=8.0.0],\n[id=scripts, version=45.7.0], [id=selenium,\nversion=15.30.0], [id=soap, version=23.0.0], [id=spider,\nversion=0.12.0], [id=spiderAjax, version=23.21.0], [id=tips,\nversion=13.0.0], [id=webdriverlinux, version=116.0.0],\n[id=websocket, version=31.0.0], [id=zest, version=47.0.0]]\n\nOperating System: Linux\nArchitecture: amd64\nCPU Cores: 12\nMax Memory: 15 GB\nJava Version: Arch Linux 21.0.5\nSystem's Locale: en_US\nDisplay Locale: en_GB\nFormat Locale: en_US\nDefault Charset: UTF-8\nZAP Home Directory: /home/user/.ZAP/\nZAP Installation Directory: /usr/share/zaproxy/./\nLook and Feel: FlatLaf Darcula (com.formdev.flatlaf.FlatDarculaLaf)\n```\n\n### Screenshots:\n\n_No response_\n\n### Errors from the zap.log file:\n\n_No response_\n\n### Additional context:\n\n_No response_\n\n### Would you like to help fix this issue?\n\n- [ ] Yes","closed_by":{"login":"psiinon","id":1081115,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwODExMTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1081115?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/psiinon","html_url":"https://github.com/psiinon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psiinon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psiinon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psiinon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psiinon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psiinon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psiinon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psiinon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psiinon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psiinon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zaproxy/zaproxy/issues/8760/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zaproxy/zaproxy/issues/8760/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
