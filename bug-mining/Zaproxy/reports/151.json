might get in situations where ZAP isn't working/behaving as expected, or they feel the screwed up the configuration and broke it (whether they actually broke it or not).\n\nOne of the common remediation ideas is to do a factory reset to make sure the configuration isn't screwed up. Seems like in the Options panel we could add a line as a peer of Options (but after it so its at the VERY end of the list) called Factory Reset - and this could be used to reset either EVERYTHING in ZAP, or at least ALL the options you can configure in the Options panel.\n\nNot sure if this reset should throw away downloaded plugins, change your session properties, or anything else that can change. But it should at least reset all the Options. And it should be clear about what it does and does not reset.\n","closed_by":{"login":"kingthorin","id":7570458,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc1NzA0NTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7570458?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kingthorin","html_url":"https://github.com/kingthorin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kingthorin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kingthorin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kingthorin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kingthorin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kingthorin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kingthorin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kingthorin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kingthorin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kingthorin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zaproxy/zaproxy/issues/2701/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zaproxy/zaproxy/issues/2701/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
