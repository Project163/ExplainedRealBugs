the bug**\r\nCan not use mouse wheel to scroll past 'Context' in 'Sites' tab.\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\nSteps to reproduce the behavior:\r\n1. Go to 'Sites'\r\n2. Browse around a bunch with the proxy on so the Sites populate\r\n3. Scroll to the top of the list with both sites and contexts expanded\r\n4. Use mouse wheel to scroll down\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nThe list scrolls normally to the bottom.\r\n\r\n**Observed behavior**\r\nThe scrolling stops at the end of Contexts. Neither can you use arrow keys to go down from the bottom most entry in contexts.\r\nHowever dragging the scrollbar manually with the mouse past that point allows normal scrolling. Just not when any context is in view.\r\n\r\n**Screenshots**\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n**Software versions**\r\n - ZAP: 2.10\r\n - Add-on: N/A\r\n - OS: Ubuntu 20.04 (5.4.0-70-generic, amd64)\r\n - Java: openjdk 11.0.10 2021-01-19\r\n - Browser: N/A\r\n\r\n**Errors from the zap.log file**\r\nNone\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nNone\r\n\r\n**Would you like to help fix this issue?**\r\nI don't do java.","closed_by":{"login":"ricekot","id":16446369,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NDQ2MzY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16446369?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ricekot","html_url":"https://github.com/ricekot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ricekot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ricekot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ricekot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ricekot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ricekot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ricekot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ricekot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ricekot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ricekot/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zaproxy/zaproxy/issues/6520/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zaproxy/zaproxy/issues/6520/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
