not sure if there is anything new in the FAQ. I am already using the:\r\n`_JAVA_OPTIONS='-Dawt.useSystemAAFontSettings=gasp'`\r\nin /etc/environment (the effect is visible on the screenshots).\r\n\r\nI've tested the options from the FAQ (I've changed the `JAVA_FONTS` path because there is no \"TTF\" folder in Kali):\r\n```\r\n_JAVA_OPTIONS='-Dawt.useSystemAAFontSettings=on'\r\nJAVA_OPTIONS='-Dawt.useSystemAAFontSettings=on'\r\nJAVA_FONTS=/usr/share/fonts/truetype\r\n```\r\nI've also tried to run the zap from the command line.\r\n\r\nThere is no difference in font rendering. That is: the font looks like with the: `_JAVA_OPTIONS='-Dawt.useSystemAAFontSettings=gasp'` option that I already used. I don't think that additional options are necessary, it's possible that it's the only option needed.\r\n\r\nThe problem on the screenshot in #3051 looks like missing `_JAVA_OPTIONS='-Dawt.useSystemAAFontSettings=gasp'` - without this the font rendering is certainly worse.\r\n\r\nThe problem I've written about is related to the source/request/response code window - please compare the request/response font with the interface font (on the screenshot). With `_JAVA_OPTIONS='-Dawt.useSystemAAFontSettings=gasp'` the font in the interface is quite OK, but the font in the request/response window is still \"bad\", as shown in the attached comparison between the zap/burp/system font rendering.","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zaproxy/zaproxy/issues/comments/325808575/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"ksdev-pl","id":4216259,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyMTYyNTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4216259?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ksdev-pl","html_url":"https://github.com/ksdev-pl","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ksdev-pl/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ksdev-pl/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ksdev-pl/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ksdev-pl/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ksdev-pl/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ksdev-pl/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ksdev-pl/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ksdev-pl/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ksdev-pl/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zaproxy/zaproxy/issues/comments/325809937","html_url":"https://github.com/zaproxy/zaproxy/issues/3490#issuecomment-325809937","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zaproxy/zaproxy/issues/3490","id":325809937,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMyNTgwOTkzNw==","user":{"login":"thc202","id":4639210,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ2MzkyMTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4639210?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/thc202","html_url":"https://github.com/thc202","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thc202/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thc202/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thc202/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thc202/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thc202/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thc202/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thc202/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thc202/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thc202/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-08-29T21:29:16Z","updated_at":"2017-08-29T21:29:16Z","body":"@ksdev-pl is the setting (context menu) View > Anti-Aliasing enabled in the Request/Response tabs?
