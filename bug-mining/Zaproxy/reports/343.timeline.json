1 second interval and 1 thread I can reproduce this on real sites after 10 requests. At 64th request the pause is 15 seconds. I was fuzzing the URL path. Please see the video. RTT is 160-180. No outgoing proxy used.\r\n\r\nhttps://youtu.be/ifeWC3I333g\r\n\r\nMake sure to test with 1 sec interval, 1 thread and a real site with RTT higher than 150.\r\nTurn on the \"follow redirects\" feature.\r\n\r\nThis easy to reproduce issue forces me to write my own fuzzer.
