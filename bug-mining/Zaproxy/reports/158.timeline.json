Also, deprecate old constructor/methods that\r\nrequire the file name to have the status/version and introduce new\r\nconstructor/methods where applicable.\r\nChange BaseZapAddOnXmlData to read the status from the manifest file of\r\nthe add-on (ZapAddOn.xml).\r\nRemove hardcoded manifest file name (ZapAddOn.xml) from JavaDoc and code\r\n(by using the constant from AddOn).\r\nChange
