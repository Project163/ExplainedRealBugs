Run ZAP (version 2.4.2);\n2. Create and save a (JavaScript) \"Fuzzer HTTP Processor\", with name \"1\" and a \"Proxy\" script, with name \"2\";\n3. Go to \"Extensions\" options panel and disable the extension \"Advance Fuzzer\";\n4. Restart ZAP;\n5. Note that in \"Script\" tab no (JavaScript) templates nor the \"Proxy\" script were loaded;\n6. Check the log file, there should be an exception, which is expected since the \"Fuzzer HTTP Processor\" script type was not found:\n\n```\n11087 [ZAP-BootstrapGUI] ERROR org.parosproxy.paros.extension.ExtensionLoader  - Script does not define a type: 1\njava.security.InvalidParameterException: Script does not define a type: 1\n    at org.zaproxy.zap.extension.script.ScriptTreeModel.addScript(Unknown Source)\n    at org.zaproxy.zap.extension.script.ExtensionScript.addScript(Unknown Source)\n    at org.zaproxy.zap.extension.script.ExtensionScript.postInit(Unknown Source)\n    at org.parosproxy.paros.extension.ExtensionLoader.hookAllExtension(Unknown Source)\n    at org.parosproxy.paros.extension.ExtensionLoader.startLifeCycle(Unknown Source)\n    at org.parosproxy.paros.control.AbstractControl.loadExtension(Unknown Source)\n    at org.parosproxy.paros.control.Control.init(Unknown Source)\n    at org.parosproxy.paros.control.Control.initSingletonWithView(Unknown Source)\n    at org.zaproxy.zap.GuiBootstrap.initControlAndPostViewInit(Unknown Source)\n    at org.zaproxy.zap.GuiBootstrap.access$100(Unknown Source)\n    at org.zaproxy.zap.GuiBootstrap$2.run(Unknown Source)\n    at java.lang.Thread.run(Thread.java:745)\n```\n\nRemarks:\nFailing to load a script should not prevent loading the other scripts (nor the templates).\n\nZAP Version:\nVersions >= 2.2.1\n","closed_by":{"login":"psiinon","id":1081115,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwODExMTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1081115?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/psiinon","html_url":"https://github.com/psiinon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psiinon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psiinon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psiinon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psiinon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psiinon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psiinon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psiinon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psiinon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psiinon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zaproxy/zaproxy/issues/1949/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zaproxy/zaproxy/issues/1949/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
