https://github.com/thc202/zaproxy/releases/tag/w2016-01-22\n\nIt was a 2.5.0 release milestone that was address but does not seem to have been applied, i have tested the custom build `w2016-01-22` and it still works as a fix but it does not seem to have been applied to the 2.5.0 release.\n\nCould we re-open this issue and if it's an easy fix apply it to the upcoming weekly's and as part of the 2.6.0 milestone please?\n\nEDIT: I have looked through the source and the fix has been applied to Alerts.java however this does not solve the issue in 2.5.X series at all. `w2016-01-22` is unaffected however, that would indicate that there is a change in Alerts or in another class which is causing the report generation to break.\n#2132\n\n@thc202 \n@kingthorin \n@psiinon
