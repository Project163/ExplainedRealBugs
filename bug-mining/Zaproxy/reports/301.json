the bug**\r\nIf you modify an existing Global Exclude to update the description the changes are not accepted. There's no error but they just don't stick.\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\nSteps to reproduce the behavior:\r\n1. Launch ZAP. (2.7.0 or latest Dev build)\r\n2. Go into Options and \"Global Exclude URL\" [With or without [Beta] tag depending on build]\r\n3. Select an existing entry, click the Modify... button.\r\n4. Add some text to the \"Description\" and click the Modify button.\r\n5. Back in the Options panel note that no update occurred. (Repeat step 3 with the same entry, note the description wasn't change... so not just a table update issue, the change was seemingly discarded.)\r\n\r\nNote: Modifying the regex _does_ seem to behave as expected.\r\nNote2: When you Add... a new entry you can create it with no description, however when modifying the Modify button is disabled when the description field is cleared.\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nModifying a Global Exclude to update the description should work :+1: \r\n\r\n**Software versions**\r\n - ZAP: 2.7.0 & Dev\r\n - OS: Kali/Win7","closed_by":{"login":"psiinon","id":1081115,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwODExMTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1081115?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/psiinon","html_url":"https://github.com/psiinon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psiinon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psiinon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psiinon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psiinon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psiinon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psiinon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psiinon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psiinon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psiinon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zaproxy/zaproxy/issues/5118/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zaproxy/zaproxy/issues/5118/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
