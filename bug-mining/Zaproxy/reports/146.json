to reproduce the bug.\n\n1) Setup a page with the following content (say at http://host/Zap)\n\n```\n<html>\n<head>\n    <base href=\"/Zap/\" />\n    <meta charset=\"utf-8\" />\n    <meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width\" />\n    <title>Index</title>\n    <link href=\"/Zap/Content/site.css\" rel=\"stylesheet\"/>\n    <script src=\"/Zap/Scripts/modernizr-2.6.2.js\"></script>\n</head>\n<body>\n<h2>Main Navigation</h2>\n<ul>\n    <li><a href=\"/Zap/\">Home</a></li>\n    <li><a href=\"/Zap/Testlink\">Testlink</a></li>\n</ul>\n    <script src=\"/Zap/Scripts/jquery-1.8.2.js\"></script>\n</body>\n</html>\n```\n\n2) Setup a trivial page at http://host/Zap/Testlink\n\n3) Use ZAP to spider http://host/Zap\n\nExpected Result:\n- ZAP Spider finds  http://host/Zap/Testlink\n\nActual Result:\n- ZAP Spider does not find http://host/Zap/Testlink\n- Chrome and IE happily follow the link.\n- Removing the line `<base href=\"/Zap/\" />` and running the spider again results in ZAP spider finding http://host/Zap/Testlink\n\nZAP Version: 2.5.0\n","closed_by":{"login":"psiinon","id":1081115,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwODExMTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1081115?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/psiinon","html_url":"https://github.com/psiinon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psiinon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psiinon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psiinon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psiinon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psiinon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psiinon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psiinon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psiinon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psiinon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zaproxy/zaproxy/issues/2939/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zaproxy/zaproxy/issues/2939/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
