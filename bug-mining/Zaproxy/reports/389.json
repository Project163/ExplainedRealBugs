Describe the bug\r\n\r\nWe document the `-dir` option as a way to start ZAP with a clean config: https://www.zaproxy.org/docs/desktop/cmdline/\r\nHowever on some platforms add-ons are deleted from the install dir when they are updated.\r\nIf the user updates one of the mandatory add-ons then it breaks this option - ZAP will not start.\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce the behavior\r\n\r\n1. Install ZAP\r\n2. Update ZAP (making sure at least one mandatory option is updated)\r\n3. Run ZAP using the `-d` option\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\n\r\nZAP will start with all of the orignal add-ons\r\n\r\n### Software versions\r\n\r\n2.12.0\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Errors from the zap.log file\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Additional context\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Would you like to help fix this issue?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes","closed_by":{"login":"kingthorin","id":7570458,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc1NzA0NTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7570458?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kingthorin","html_url":"https://github.com/kingthorin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kingthorin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kingthorin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kingthorin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kingthorin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kingthorin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kingthorin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kingthorin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kingthorin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kingthorin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zaproxy/zaproxy/issues/7703/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zaproxy/zaproxy/issues/7703/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
