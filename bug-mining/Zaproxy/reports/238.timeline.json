requests are more relevant than others, so having the ability to mark these in the history view by adding color to lines would help in analyzing more complex flows like complex login processes, features that require two-factor authentication, or flows that pass tokens to different services.\r\n\r\nThe minimal feature would be selecting a set consecutive of requests, and the select from the context menu `Colour -> blue (in blue?)`. A selection of a few colours (maybe matching the RSyntaxTextArea ones) would enable the user to use some personal colour coding for the messy parts of manual testing.\r\n\r\nEnhancements to this feature could be colouring entries based on regular expressions, contexts, or some other rules, a bit like like [rules in wireshark](https://www.wireshark.org/docs/wsug_html_chunked/ChCustColorizationSection.html). Also being able to set the colour of histroy entries in scripts could be a nice addition.
