Run vulnerable app\r\n`docker run -t clazba/invoicer-chapter3`\r\n\r\n2 - Download rules config file\r\n`wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/clazba/invoicer-chapter3/master/zap-baseline.conf `\r\n\r\n3 - Scan vulnerable app using local file  \r\n`python zap-baseline.py -c zap-baseline.conf -t http://172.17.0.2:8080`\r\n\r\n> [WORKS] **FAIL-NEW: 2**     FAIL-INPROG: 0  **WARN-NEW: 3**     WARN-INPROG: 0  INFO: 0 IGNORE: 0       PASS: 21\r\n\r\n4 - Scan vulnerable app using remote file (url)\r\n`python zap-baseline.py -u https://raw.githubusercontent.com/clazba/invoicer-chapter3/master/zap-baseline.conf -t http://172.17.0.2:8080`\r\n> [FAILS] **FAIL-NEW: 0**     FAIL-INPROG: 0  **WARN-NEW: 5**     WARN-INPROG: 0  INFO: 0 IGNORE: 0       PASS: 21\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nConfigured with the same zap-baseline rule configuration file both scans should produce the same outcome. In this case should have the same number of FAIL-NEW for both scans\r\n\r\n**Software versions**\r\n - ZAP: \r\n\r\n> owasp/zap2docker-weekly:lastest (3 Sept 18)\r\n\r\n - OS: \r\n\r\n> Linux 3d49230ea593 4.15.0-33-generic #36-Ubuntu SMP Wed Aug 15 16:00:05 UTC 2018 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux\r\n\r\n - Java: \r\n\r\n> openjdk version \"1.8.0_181\"\r\n> OpenJDK Runtime Environment (build 1.8.0_181-8u181-b13-0ubuntu0.16.04.1-b13)\r\n> OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM (build 25.181-b13, mixed mode)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"psiinon","id":1081115,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwODExMTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1081115?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/psiinon","html_url":"https://github.com/psiinon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psiinon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psiinon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psiinon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psiinon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psiinon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psiinon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psiinon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psiinon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psiinon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zaproxy/zaproxy/issues/4972/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zaproxy/zaproxy/issues/4972/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
