This is because the **next method** of **module six** is taking the **first element** of the response iterator.\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce the behavior\r\n\r\n1. Create ZAP instance.\r\n2. Create context.\r\n3. Create user for the context.\r\n4. Use zap.users.get_user_by_id(context_id, user_id).\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\n\r\nIt is expected to return the following:\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n  \"credentials\": \"{ \\\"sessionName\\\": \\\"<sessionName>\\\", \\\"type\\\": \\\"<type>\\\"}\",\r\n  \"name\": \"<user>\",\r\n  \"contextId\": \"<context_id>\",\r\n  \"id\": \"<user_id>\",\r\n  \"enabled\": \"<state>\"\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Software versions\r\n\r\nZAP\r\nVersión: 2.14.0\r\n\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Errors from the zap.log file\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Additional context\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Would you like to help fix this issue?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes","closed_by":{"login":"kingthorin","id":7570458,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc1NzA0NTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7570458?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kingthorin","html_url":"https://github.com/kingthorin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kingthorin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kingthorin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kingthorin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kingthorin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kingthorin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kingthorin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kingthorin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kingthorin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kingthorin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zaproxy/zaproxy/issues/8282/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zaproxy/zaproxy/issues/8282/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
