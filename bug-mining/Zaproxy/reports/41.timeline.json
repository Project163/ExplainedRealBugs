reason I could see offhand is that some of the test cases (https://localhost:8443/benchmark/BenchmarkTest00008.html, for instance) send a custom request header (\"vector\" is used in this case).  Zap, however, does not scan this header, even with the \"HTTP Headers\" input vector enabled.  This appears to be due to the following code in org.parosproxy.paros.core.scanner.VariantHeader:\n\n```\npublic static final String[] injectableHeaders = {\n    HttpRequestHeader.USER_AGENT,\n    HttpRequestHeader.REFERER,\n    HttpRequestHeader.HOST\n};\n```\n\nIn other words, only these 3 headers are ever attacked by default.\n\nFor this specific example, if you specify a custom attack vector, and ensure that the \"SQL Injection - Hypersonic\" scanner is enabled, the issue is successfully detected and alerted.  The \"Advanced SQL Injection\" scanner does not detect the SQL Injection issue, for some reason.\n\nIf you want, I can raise a separate issue for this header-scanning

A few things I've noticed:\n- Some Benchmark test cases do not work, due to exceptions being thrown by the Benchmark code itself (class not found), before the attack even commences.  These cases can never be successfully detected by ZAP, or any dynamic scanner, for that matter.  I've raised the issue upstream.  Keep an eye on the Benchmark logs to see if this issue affects you.\n- The HyperSonic db used by Benchmark gets corrupted quite quickly when attacked with any of the SQL Injection scanners, making the platform subsequently unusable, even when not under attack.  I've raised the issue upstream, and requested a lightweight means of \"resetting\" the database periodically (such as by making a POST request).\n- The Benchmark app (running in its default installation) runs in a highly insecure dedicated Tomcat 8 installation (admin user with no password, various console webapps exposed on all interfaces). For the sake of the security of your test rigs, I suggest you make sure your host-based firewalls block port 8443 inbound.\n- The Ajax Spider must be run (in addition to the \"classic\"/\"old skool\" spider), to detect a number of the vulnerabilities.\n- A number of the scanners need to be set to \"High\" attack strength to detect the vulnerabilities.\n- URL parameters, POST parameters, headers (using the updated logic), and cookies must be attacked, to detect some of the vulnerabilities.\n","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zaproxy/zaproxy/issues/comments/140801569/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"ElColmo","id":7458310,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc0NTgzMTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7458310?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ElColmo","html_url":"https://github.com/ElColmo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ElColmo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ElColmo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ElColmo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ElColmo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ElColmo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ElColmo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ElColmo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ElColmo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ElColmo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zaproxy/zaproxy/issues/comments/140804394","html_url":"https://github.com/zaproxy/zaproxy/issues/1890#issuecomment-140804394","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zaproxy/zaproxy/issues/1890","id":140804394,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE0MDgwNDM5NA==","user":{"login":"psiinon","id":1081115,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwODExMTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1081115?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/psiinon","html_url":"https://github.com/psiinon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psiinon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psiinon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psiinon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psiinon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psiinon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psiinon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psiinon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psiinon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psiinon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-09-16T17:01:42Z","updated_at":"2015-09-16T17:01:42Z","body":"Thanks - thats really useful!\nRicardo has also been looking into some ZAP performance issues, including memory leaks and ZAP db tuning.\n@ElColmo : does the Path Traversal rule find any issues at High strength?

It's a big task to run each scanner against each of the test areas within Benchmark.  It's useful that @thc202  is looking more at the core, because that's complementary.\n\nOne other issue that came out of my analysis so far is that the Active Scan tab and the active scan popup window don't accurately reflect the actual number of request sent by the active scan, since they do not include requests that were actually sent, but which timed out (based on the timeout setting).  That tripped me up for a bit, since some active scans appeared to be completely locked up, but wireshark and netstat suggested something was going on behind the scenes, which prompted me to dig into it a bit more.  This was caused by the issue I mentioned earlier, where Benchmark requests for specific URLs gets un-responsive after SQL Injection attacks.\n\nmore peculiarities in ZAP:\n- An Ajax scan initiated using the API  does not show in the status bar in the GUI (the only indication that it's happening is the Firefox / Iceweasel window popping up, it seems)\n- Requests sent by the Ajax spider (when run manually, rather than via the API, at least) do not appear in the History tab, for some reason.  If you want to active scan one of these requests, you need to first right-click the request in the Ajax spider tab, click \"Find in sites tree\", right-click that node, and active scan that.  It's clumsy (given that I normally select requests in the history).\n","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zaproxy/zaproxy/issues/comments/140833634/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"ElColmo","id":7458310,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc0NTgzMTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7458310?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ElColmo","html_url":"https://github.com/ElColmo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ElColmo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ElColmo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ElColmo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ElColmo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ElColmo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ElColmo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ElColmo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ElColmo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ElColmo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":411282058,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50NDExMjgyMDU4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zaproxy/zaproxy/issues/events/411282058","actor":{"login":"psiinon","id":1081115,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwODExMTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1081115?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/psiinon","html_url":"https://github.com/psiinon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psiinon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psiinon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psiinon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psiinon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psiinon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psiinon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psiinon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psiinon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psiinon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2015-09-16T18:28:01Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":411282059,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDQxMTI4MjA1OQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zaproxy/zaproxy/issues/events/411282059","actor":{"login":"psiinon","id":1081115,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwODExMTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1081115?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/psiinon","html_url":"https://github.com/psiinon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psiinon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psiinon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psiinon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psiinon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psiinon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psiinon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psiinon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psiinon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psiinon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2015-09-16T18:28:01Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":411282060,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50NDExMjgyMDYw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zaproxy/zaproxy/issues/events/411282060","actor":{"login":"thc202","id":4639210,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ2MzkyMTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4639210?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/thc202","html_url":"https://github.com/thc202","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thc202/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thc202/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thc202/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thc202/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thc202/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thc202/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thc202/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thc202/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thc202/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2015-09-16T18:28:01Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":411282061,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDQxMTI4MjA2MQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zaproxy/zaproxy/issues/events/411282061","actor":{"login":"thc202","id":4639210,"node_id":"MDQ

two more TPs.\nWhile \"SQL Injection\" reported more TPs it also reported FPs, leading to lower score.\nIt was also run with DOM XSS scanner that's why the (great) improvement of \"Cross-Site Scripting\" (and overall) results.\n\nWorth noting that in all cases no \"Path Traversal\" vulnerabilities were reported (double checked with \"Alerts\" tab).\n\nThe [persistence properties of DB](http://www.hsqldb.org/doc/2.0/guide/management-chapt.html#mtc_cache_persistence) used by ZAP were slightly changed to (try) improve the speed of the scans.\nOne of the properties that had more noticeable results was the disable of log. No more unnecessary checkpoints and backups, which improved the time of the scans and number of requests sent per second. The drawback is that it could lead to data loss, but not a problem when running the benchmarks.\n\nNote: I used a modified version of OWASP Benchmark for all the tests because it was giving some issues that prevented it from working properly (change already submitted in a PR).\n\n@ElColmo I'm not seeing the \"class not found\" errors, it says:\n\n```\n[INFO] Press Ctrl-C to stop the container...\n[INFO] [talledLocalContainer] DataBase tables/procedures created.\n```\n\nIs that happening always? Maybe that's what's causing the issue(s) with database?\nWhich SQLi scanner(s) is breaking the DB?\n\nIndeed, the active scanner is not updating the number of requests sent in case of errors, I'll take a look at that.\nThe AJAX spider was not yet updated to show the API scans in the GUI.\nThat's an issue, the requests should be associated with the node. It shows the requests in \"AJAX Spider\" tab instead of \"History\" because that's how all components work (each one shows the results in its own tab).\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zaproxy/zaproxy/issues/comments/141089435/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"thc202","id":4639210,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ2MzkyMTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4639210?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/thc202","html_url":"https://github.com/thc202","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thc202/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thc202/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thc202/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thc202/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thc202/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thc202/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thc202/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thc202/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thc202/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":412106783,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50NDEyMTA2Nzgz","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zaproxy/zaproxy/issues/events/412106783","actor":{"login":"ElColmo","id":7458310,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc0NTgzMTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7458310?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ElColmo","html_url":"https://github.com/ElColmo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ElColmo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ElColmo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ElColmo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ElColmo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ElColmo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ElColmo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ElColmo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ElColmo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ElColmo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2015-09-17T13:38:25Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":412106784,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDQxMjEwNjc4NA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zaproxy/zaproxy/issues/events/412106784","actor":{"login":"ElColmo","id":7458310,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc0NTgzMTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7458310?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ElColmo","html_url":"https://github.com/ElColmo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ElColmo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ElColmo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ElColmo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ElColmo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ElColmo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ElColmo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ElColmo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ElColmo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ElColmo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2015-09-17T13:38:25Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zaproxy/zaproxy/issues/comments/141100947","html_url":"https://github.com/zaproxy/zaproxy/issues/1890#issuecomment-141100947","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zaproxy/zaproxy/issues/1890","id":141100947,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE0MTEwMDk0Nw==","user":{"login":"ElColmo","id":7458310,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc0NTgzMTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7458310?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ElColmo","html_url":"https://github.com/ElColmo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ElColmo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ElColmo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ElColmo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ElColmo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ElColmo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ElColmo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ElColmo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ElColmo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ElColmo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-09-17T14:16:49Z","updated_at":"2015-09-17T14:16:49Z","body":"Very

I'm very much\ndoing this work in the background, so this is not currently my main focus.\n\nColm\n\nOn 17 September 2015 at 14:38, thc202 notifications@github.com wrote:\n\n> ZAP is now able to fully scan OWASP Benchmark (with just 512MiB of heap\n> memory), the active scanner was able to send ~2M requests without problems.\n> With 2.4.2 it would fail with OOME (around 450k requests).\n> \n> Following test results with ZAP built from develop branch, with normal\n> (and AJAX) spider, with and without appropriate input vectors enabled (i.e.\n> HTTP headers (including \"vector\" header), Cookies) and all add-ons bundled\n> with version 2.4.2.\n> \n> Running just the normal spider without enabling appropriate input vectors:\n> Category TP FN TN FP Total TPR FPR Score Command Injection 44 82 125 0 251\n> 34.92% 0.00% 34.92% Cross-Site Scripting 71 175 209 0 455 28.86% 0.00%\n> 28.86% Insecure Cookie 36 0 31 0 67 100.00% 0.00% 100.00% LDAP Injection 0\n> 27 32 0 59 0.00% 0.00% 0.00% Path Traversal 0 133 135 0 268 0.00% 0.00%\n> 0.00% SQL Injection 96 176 232 0 504 35.29% 0.00% 35.29% Trust Boundary\n> Violation 0 83 43 0 126 0.00% 0.00% 0.00% Weak Encryption Algorithm 0 130\n> 116 0 246 0.00% 0.00% 0.00% Weak Hash Algorithm 0 129 107 0 236 0.00%\n> 0.00% 0.00% Weak Random Number 0 218 275 0 493 0.00% 0.00% 0.00% XPath\n> Injection 0 15 20 0 35 0.00% 0.00% 0.00% Totals 247 1168 1325 0 2740\n> 18.10% 0.00% 18.10%\n> \n> This results should be the same as the ones reported in OWASP Benchmark\n> site\n> https://rawgit.com/OWASP/Benchmark/master/scorecard/Benchmark_v1.2beta_Scorecard_for_OWASP_ZAP.html\n> (with the exception of \"SQL Injection\" which performed better).\n> \n> Running with appropriate input vectors and AJAX spider leads to more\n> findings (some of the tests require client side interaction):\n> Category TP FN TN FP Total TPR FPR Score Command Injection 46 80 125 0 251\n> 36.51% 0.00% 36.51% Cross-Site Scripting 207 39 207 2 455 84.15% 0.96%\n> 83.19% Insecure Cookie 36 0 31 0 67 100.00% 0.00% 100.00% LDAP Injection 0\n> 27 32 0 59 0.00% 0.00% 0.00% Path Traversal 0 133 135 0 268 0.00% 0.00%\n> 0.00% SQL Injection 104 168 205 27 504 38.24% 11.64% 26.60% Trust\n> Boundary Violation 0 83 43 0 126 0.00% 0.00% 0.00% Weak Encryption\n> Algorithm 0 130 116 0 246 0.00% 0.00% 0.00% Weak Hash Algorithm 0 129 107\n> 0 236 0.00% 0.00% 0.00% Weak Random Number 0 218 275 0 493 0.00% 0.00%\n> 0.00% XPath Injection 0 15 20 0 35 0.00% 0.00% 0.00% Totals 393 1022 1296\n> 29 2740 23.54% 1.14% 22.39%\n> \n> The \"Command Injection\" reported two more TPs.\n> While \"SQL Injection\" reported more TPs it also reported FPs, leading to\n> lower score.\n> It was also run with DOM XSS scanner that's why the (great) improvement of\n> \"Cross-Site Scripting\" (and overall) results.\n> \n> Worth noting that in all cases no \"Path Traversal\" vulnerabilities were\n> reported (double checked with \"Alerts\" tab).\n> \n> The persistence properties of DB\n> http://www.hsqldb.org/doc/2.0/guide/management-chapt.html#mtc_cache_persistence\n> used by ZAP were slightly changed to (try) improve the speed of the scans.\n> One of the properties that had more noticeable results was the disable of\n> log.
