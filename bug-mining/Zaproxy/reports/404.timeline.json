Describe the bug:\n\nThe exit status job does not take into account alert filter job when error level is set to \"high\" and all alerts with risk \"high\" changed to \"false positive\".\n\n\n\n### Steps to reproduce the behavior:\n\n1. Create automation via UI or via yaml with alertFilter and exitStatus job with the following configuration:\n```\njobs:\n # add jobs e.g. passiveScan-config\n  - name: Alert Filters\n    type: alertFilter\n    alertFilters:\n      - ruleId: 6\n        ruleName: Path Traversal\n        newRisk: False Positive\n        url: <url>\n        methods:\n          - GET\n    parameters:\n      deleteGlobalAlerts: true\n  - name: Fetch Open API\n    type: openapi\n    parameters:\n      apiUrl: https://dev.connect.uni-eng.de/v3/api-docs\n      targetUrl: https://dev.connect.uni-eng.de/\n      context: Authentication Context\n      user: produser\n  # add jobs e.g. passiveScan or spider to get alerts\n  - type: exitStatus\n    parameters:\n      errorLevel: High\n      warnExitValue: 0\n      errorExitValue: 1\n```\n2. Run automation to find alerts.\n3. The found alert is filtered out and is not shown in alert tab (UI) or in report later on.\n4.  Alerts of type \"Path Traversal\" will be changed to risk \"False Positive\"\n5.
