Run ZAP (2.4.2), without add-ons with scanners (so that's easier to reproduce the issue);\n2. Install add-ons with active and passive scanners (for example, add-ons \"Active scanner rules\" and \"Passive scanner rules\");\n3. Open the \"Scan Policy Manager\" dialogue (Ctrl+P), select \"Default policy\", press \"Modify\" button and note that the installed scanners shown \"Unknown\" quality;\n4. Open the \"Options\" dialogue, select \"Passive Scan Rules\" and note the same issue.\n\nActive scanners added twice on add-on installation:\nSteps to reproduce the issue:\n1. Run ZAP (2.4.2), without add-ons with active scanners;\n2. Install the add-on with active scanners (for example, \"Active scanner rules\" add-on);\n3. Note the messages in the log, which means that the scanners are being loaded twice:\n\n```\n38801 [AWT-EventQueue-0] INFO org.parosproxy.paros.core.scanner.PluginFactory  - loaded plugin Path Traversal\n38801 [AWT-EventQueue-0] INFO org.parosproxy.paros.core.scanner.PluginFactory  - Ignoring (apparently) less stable scanner version, id=6, ExistingPlugin[Status=release, Class=org.zaproxy.zap.extension.ascanrules.TestPathTraversal], LessStablePlugin[Status=unknown, Class=org.zaproxy.zap.extension.ascanrules.TestPathTraversal]\n```\n\nwith 2.4.0, the messages are different:\n\n```\n79916 [AWT-EventQueue-0] INFO org.parosproxy.paros.core.scanner.PluginFactory  - loaded plugin Path Traversal\n79916 [AWT-EventQueue-0] ERROR org.parosproxy.paros.core.scanner.PluginFactory  - Duplicate id 6 org.zaproxy.zap.extension.ascanrules.TestPathTraversal org.zaproxy.zap.extension.ascanrules.TestPathTraversal\n```\n\n4. Uninstall the add-on with active scanners (for example, \"Active scanner rules\" add-on);\n5.
