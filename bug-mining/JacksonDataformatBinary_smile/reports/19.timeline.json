thanks for the response.\r\n\r\nI actually got curious and went digging a little bit.\r\nIt seems due to `SmileBufferRecycler` being created in the `main` thread and so, created only once in `SmileParserBase` `ThreadLocal _smileRecyclerRef` and then used inside all the parallel thread.\r\nSecond problem, in `SmileBufferRecycler` there is a race condition between the get and the set to null.\r\n\r\nI tried two solutions that both worked:\r\n* wrapped `SmileBufferRecycler._seenNamesBuffer` in an AtomicReference\r\n* replacing the `SmileParserBase._smileBufferRecycler` field by the method with the same name so that it is lazily instantiated by the correct thread when needed\r\n\r\nIn the first solution, we only have one instance of `SmileBufferRecycler` shared by all the parallel threads.\r\nI had no further insights about what it was supposed to be in this context, so I was not sure about making a PR.","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-dataformats-binary/issues/comments/1587479496/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"simondaudin","id":20225932,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwMjI1OTMy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20225932?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/simondaudin","html_url":"https://github.com/simondaudin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/simondaudin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/simondaudin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/simondaudin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/simondaudin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/simondaudin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/simondaudin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/simondaudin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/simondaudin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/simondaudin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-dataformats-binary/issues/comments/1588405714","html_url":"https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-dataformats-binary/issues/384#issuecomment-1588405714","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-dataformats-binary/issues/384","id":1588405714,"node_id":"IC_kwDOA3Qg685erSXS","user":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder","html_url":"https://github.com/cowtowncoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-06-13T02:07:16Z","updated_at":"2023-06-13T02:07:16Z","body":"This may be due to earlier assumptions that parser instances were bound 1-to-1 on threads, and as such buffer recyclers would work without explicit synchronization as long as `ThreadLocal` was used.
