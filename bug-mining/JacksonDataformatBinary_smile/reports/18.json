I'm no expert, but it looks like this: https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-dataformats-binary/blob/3f7a994b2a748e0a0782483f4a6d8cfd558082c3/cbor/src/main/java/tools/jackson/dataformat/cbor/CBORGenerator.java#L870 still ignores the offset parameter.\r\n\r\nIn my version the method's source is:\r\n```\r\n    @Override\r\n    public void writeRawUTF8String(byte[] raw, int offset, int len)\r\n            throws IOException\r\n    {\r\n        _verifyValueWrite(\"write String value\");\r\n        if (len == 0) {\r\n            _writeByte(BYTE_EMPTY_STRING);\r\n            return;\r\n        }\r\n        _writeLengthMarker(PREFIX_TYPE_TEXT, len);\r\n        _writeBytes(raw, 0, len);\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd it certainly isn't touching the `offset` parameter.
