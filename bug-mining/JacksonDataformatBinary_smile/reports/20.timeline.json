that `jackson-core` added pluggability of recycler pools (see https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-core/issues/1089 ), and also provides a set of reusable implementations (see https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-core/pull/1064) we can tackle Smile-specific additional recycling: it also needs to allow re-configuring esp. to work with Project Loom where `ThreadLocal` based pooling really does not work well. This is likely to also help with Android usage, where `SoftRefernence`s (used by default Smile recycler, in addition to `ThreadLocal`) does not work as well as vanilla J2SE JDKs.\r\n\r\nSo let's try to get this done for 2.16.\r\n\r\nClass to change is `SmileBufferRecycler`.\r\nFor 2.16 we should still default to traditional recycler, but for 2.17+ should probably change the default. This allows for early adopters to switch over sooner, while we get feedback on how pooling works, best default to use.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-dataformats-binary/issues/399/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-dataformats-binary/issues/399/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"actor":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder","html_url":"https://github.com/cowtowncoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-10-04T03:42:39Z","updated_at":"2023-10-04T03:42:39Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-core/issues/1089","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-core","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-core/issues/1089/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-core/issues/1089/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-core/issues/1089/events","html_url":"https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-core/issues/1089","id":1867875268,"node_id":"I_kwDOAC5a085vVYPE","number":1089,"title":"Allow

the current hard-coder `ThreadLocal`-based buffer recycling (via `BufferRecycler` containers accessed via `BufferRecyclers`) has worked reasonably well up until recently, changes to later JVMs have made `ThreadLocal` access less beneficial; and in near future (Project Loom et al) even counter-productive.\r\nBut there are other ways to allow beneficial buffer recycling: especially for use cases where pooling is integrated with other frameworks.\r\n\r\nTo allow new default and alternative recycling schemes, let's add `RecyclerPool` extension point, make current implementation work with it.\r\nAnd for bonus points, possibly implement one or more alternate implementations to use.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-core/issues/1089/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-core/issues/1089/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":11614793785,"node_id":"REFE_lADOA3Qg685yoHn4zwAAAAK0S7A5","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-dataformats-binary/issues/events/11614793785","actor":{"login":"tgregg","id":7432835,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc0MzI4MzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7432835?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgregg","html_url":"https://github.com/tgregg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgregg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgregg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgregg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgregg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgregg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgregg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgregg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgregg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tgregg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"200ee040cbb508bfc18e6f4d77aa2f48891c5002","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tgregg/jackson-dataformats-binary/commits/200ee040cbb508bfc18e6f4d77aa2f48891c5002","created_at":"2024-01-27T02:57:48Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
