is probably more a usage question than an issue.\n\nI've got something goofy in [denominator](http://techblog.netflix.com/2013/03/denominator-multi-vendor-interface-for.html) wrt dagger.  Basically a Provider (like route53) is a dagger module.  I want to make it easy to implement and inject provider metadata without having to know too many details.  For example, our [DNSApiManager](https://github.com/Netflix/denominator/blob/master/denominator-core/src/main/java/denominator/DNSApiManager.java) uses [Provider](https://github.com/Netflix/denominator/blob/master/denominator-core/src/main/java/denominator/Provider.java) (a dagger module) directly.\n\n```\n    @Inject\n    DNSApiManager(Provider provider, DNSApi api, Closeable closer) {\n        this.provider = provider;\n        this.api = api;\n        this.closer = closer;\n    }\n```\n\n[Provider](https://github.com/Netflix/denominator/blob/master/denominator-core/src/main/java/denominator/Provider.java) defines some things like its name and the type of credentials it can accept as abstract methods. I'd prefer this to be an interface actually.\n\nAnyway, these are needed pre-dagger, as that metadata is used to determine what other dagger modules are needed (chicken-egg problem).\n\nex.  the module list for the graph includes the provider module, and conditionally other modules.\n`\nif (provider.defaultCredentialSupplier().isPresent()) {\n   modulesForGraph.add(credentials(provider.defaultCredentialSupplier().get()));\n`\n\nI can't put @Provides on on Provider as it is an abstract class, so I ask users to do something in their subclass which is smelly.  \n\n```\n@Provides\nProvider provideThis() {\n   return this;\n}\n```\n\nI'd like to eliminate the `provideThis()` and could if @Provides` abstract methods were somehow possible.  Another way would be to refactor denominator to unwind this in some way I'm not aware of.\n\nThoughts?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/square/dagger/issues/176/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/square/dagger/issues/176/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
