`Module(overrides=true)` is set, any `@Provides(type = SET)` methods will override as opposed to adding to ones specified by feign.\n\nThis leads to hacks inside [ReflectiveFeign](https://github.com/Netflix/feign/blob/master/feign-core/src/main/java/feign/ReflectiveFeign.java) like below, which manually enforce a base set of decoders.  These cannot be overridden by dagger at all.\n\n``` java\n      this.decoders.put(void.class, stringDecoder);\n      this.decoders.put(Response.class, stringDecoder);\n      this.decoders.put(String.class, stringDecoder);\n```\n\nAs soon as Dagger 1.1 is out (likely this week), we'll have access to the [SET_VALUES feature](https://github.com/square/dagger/issues/261), which should allow us to eliminate the troublesome `Module(overrides=true)` features.\n\nWith this in, we should update examples and any how-to docs to show how to wire up feign so as to not require or suggest `Module(overrides=true)`, except in very specific cases.\n\ncc @benjchristensen\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenFeign/feign/issues/39/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenFeign/feign/issues/39/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/square/dagger/issues/comments/22112175","html_url":"https://github.com/square/dagger/issues/261#issuecomment-22112175","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/square/dagger/issues/261","id":22112175,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIyMTEyMTc1","user":{"login":"codefromthecrypt","id":64215,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0MjE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/64215?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt","html_url":"https://github.com/codefromthecrypt","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codefromthecrypt/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2013-08-05T15:05:22Z","updated_at":"2013-08-05T15:05:22Z","body":"any chance we can get dagger 1.1 released?
