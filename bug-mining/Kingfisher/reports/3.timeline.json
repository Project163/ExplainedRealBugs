Summary\n- Updated documentation to accurately reflect that SwiftUI components enable `loadDiskFileSynchronously` by default\n- Added clarifying notes about the different default behaviors between UIKit/AppKit and SwiftUI usage\n- Explained the performance implications and how to disable this behavior if needed\n\n## Details\nThis PR addresses issue #2403 which correctly pointed out that the documentation for `loadDiskFileSynchronously` was misleading. The documentation stated that disk loading happens asynchronously by default, but this is not the case for SwiftUI components (`KFImage` and `KFAnimatedImage`).\n\nThe synchronous loading default for SwiftUI is intentional and necessary to prevent image flickering during view updates in SwiftUI's declarative environment.\n\n### Changes made:\n1. **KFOptionsSetter.swift**: Added a Note to the `loadDiskFileSynchronously` method documentation clarifying the different defaults\n2. **KFImage.swift**: Added an Important note explaining the default synchronous behavior\n3. **KFAnimatedImage.swift**: Added similar documentation for animated images\n\n## Test plan\nThis is a documentation-only change. No functional changes were made to the codebase.\n\nFixes #2403","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/onevcat/Kingfisher/issues/2411/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/onevcat/Kingfisher/issues/2411/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/onevcat/Kingfisher/issues/comments/3069986446","html_url":"https://github.com/onevcat/Kingfisher/issues/2403#issuecomment-3069986446","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/onevcat/Kingfisher/issues/2403","id":3069986446,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAf70wM62_EaO","user":{"login":"onevcat","id":1019875,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMTk4NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1019875?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/onevcat","html_url":"https://github.com/onevcat","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onevcat/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onevcat/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onevcat/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onevcat/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onevcat/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onevcat/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onevcat/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onevcat/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onevcat/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-07-14T15:17:39Z","updated_at":"2025-07-14T15:17:39Z","body":"Thank you for reporting this documentation issue.
