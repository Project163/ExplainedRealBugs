Summary\n\nThis PR fixes an issue where `ThumbnailImageDataProvider` does not handle image orientation correctly. The generated thumbnails may not match the orientation of the original image as seen by users due to missing EXIF orientation transformation.\n\n## Changes\n\n- Added `kCGImageSourceCreateThumbnailWithTransform: true` option to the thumbnail generation options in `ThumbnailImageDataProvider`\n- This ensures that thumbnails respect the original image's EXIF orientation data\n\n## Technical Details\n\nWhen using `CGImageSourceCreateThumbnailAtIndex` to generate thumbnails, the `kCGImageSourceCreateThumbnailWithTransform` option is required to automatically apply any transformation specified in the image's metadata (such as EXIF orientation). Without this option, thumbnails could appear rotated compared to the original image.\n\n## Testing\n\n- All existing tests pass\n- CocoaPods spec linting passes\n- Swift Package Manager build succeeds\n\n## Closes\n\nFixes #2395\n\n## Test Plan\n\n1. Create an image with EXIF orientation data (e.g., taken with a rotated camera)\n2. Use `ThumbnailImageDataProvider` to generate a thumbnail\n3. Verify that the thumbnail orientation matches the original image orientation as displayed by the Photos app or other image viewers","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/onevcat/Kingfisher/issues/2396/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/onevcat/Kingfisher/issues/2396/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/onevcat/Kingfisher/issues/comments/2973589911","html_url":"https://github.com/onevcat/Kingfisher/issues/2395#issuecomment-2973589911","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/onevcat/Kingfisher/issues/2395","id":2973589911,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAf70wM6xPWGX","user":{"login":"onevcat","id":1019875,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMTk4NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1019875?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/onevcat","html_url":"https://github.com/onevcat","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onevcat/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onevcat/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onevcat/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onevcat/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onevcat/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onevcat/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onevcat/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onevcat/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onevcat/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-06-15T08:34:31Z","updated_at":"2025-06-15T08:34:31Z","body":"Hi @gongzhang,\n\nThank you for reporting this issue\\!
