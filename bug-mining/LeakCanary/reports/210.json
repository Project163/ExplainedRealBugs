it will crash. The Log is as follows. I checked Leakcannary's code and found that it is because there is no cache path directory in the root path xml (leak_canary_file_paths.xml). When leakcanary.internal.LeakDirectoryProvider#newHeapDumpFile dumped the file, it was found that the downloads did not have the write permission, and they were finally put in the cache path.\r\n\r\nSo this bug occurred. I have forcibly replaced the leakcanary xml in the app with my own xml to solve this problem, but I hope the official can also modify the xml configuration or the code of newHeapDumpFile.\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n[Provide a sample project, a .hprof file or a failing test]\r\n\r\n1.
