When I run `shark-cli` with the same hprof it doesn't find those leaks because shark-cli can't know if they are really leaked or not.\r\n\r\n### Potential solutions\r\nI know the memory position of these instances so it would be great to add something like this to shark-cli:\r\n\r\n`./bin/shark-cli find-shortest-path file.hprof 331735a0`\r\n\r\nAs an extra add an `ls` to find all the instances of a given class would be great.
