This is used, for example, to implement an \"open\" button when browsing through packages. The current implementation looks first for a main activity in the category Intent#CATEGORY_INFO, and next for a main activity in the category Intent#CATEGORY_LAUNCHER. Returns null if neither are found.\r\n\r\nAFAIK we need the MAIN action and LAUNCHER category to have the LeakCanary show up in the launcher, right? So I don't think we can really remove that. I'm not sure how `getLaunchIntentForPackage()` sorts activities, here's the source:\r\n\r\nhttps://android.googlesource.com/platform/frameworks/base/+/master/core/java/android/app/ApplicationPackageManager.java#212\r\n\r\nWhich lands in this service:\r\n\r\nhttps://android.googlesource.com/platform/frameworks/base/+/master/services/core/java/com/android/server/pm/PackageManagerService.java#7236\r\n\r\nWhich goes here: https://android.googlesource.com/platform/frameworks/base/+/master/services/core/java/com/android/server/pm/ComponentResolver.java#232\r\n\r\nand that's where activities come from: https://android.googlesource.com/platform/frameworks/base/+/master/core/java/android/content/pm/PackageParser.java#3850\r\n\r\nSo, to summarize: the order of activities is based on the order in which they're defined in AndroidManifest.xml, and when looking at activities with LAUNCHER category, getLaunchIntentForPackage takes the first result from `queryIntentActivities`\r\n\r\nSo, I don't really see what LeakCanary can do here, although I welcome any idea.\r\n\r\nWhat you could do:\r\n\r\n* Figure out a way for your launcher activity to be defined before LeakCanary in the manifest\r\n* Follow the documentation recommendation and add `CATEGORY_INFO` to your launcher activity, so that it gets picked up first.\r\n* Disable the leakcanary launcher activity by setting the `leak_canary_add_launcher_icon` resource bool to false.\r\n\r\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/square/leakcanary/issues/comments/625554079/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"pyricau","id":557033,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1NzAzMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/557033?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pyricau","html_url":"https://github.com/pyricau","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pyricau/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pyricau/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pyricau/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pyricau/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pyricau/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pyricau/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pyricau/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pyricau/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pyricau/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":3315056630,"node_id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDMzMTUwNTY2MzA=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/square/leakcanary/issues/events/3315056630","actor":{"login":"pyricau","id":557033,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1NzAzMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/557033?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pyricau","html_url":"https://github.com/pyricau","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pyricau/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pyricau/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pyricau/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pyricau/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pyricau/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pyricau/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pyricau/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pyricau/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pyricau/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-05-07T23:53:14Z","label":{"name":"status:
