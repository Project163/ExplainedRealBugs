One thing to look at here is why there's only 20Mb free, i.e. if LeakCanary is using more memory than it should, or if the app code itself is doing that. If it's LeakCanary, we should fix that.\r\n\r\nIf it's the app itself, we can't quite fix that, but it might be worth building support for handling this.
