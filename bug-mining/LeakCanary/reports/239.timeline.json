:writing_hand: Describe the bug\r\nBasically, when I install a sample app, the app'll crash because of LeakedClosableObjects + detectDiskReads in   Strictmode \r\nit's quite similar as #782 \r\nAccording to this issue,  I think that i have ideas to fix this. I suppose there are two things to do\r\n\r\n1. We need to enable `StrictMode` before `super.onCreate` called according to the official site https://developer.android.com/reference/android/os/StrictMode\r\n2. the real reason it continues crashing is because of `LeakCanary` the related issue is here https://github.com/square/leakcanary/issues/2117, so the fix needs to bump a version for this.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you agree on this, I can make a PR to fix this issue.\r\n\r\n## :bomb: Steps to reproduce\r\n<!-- How we can reproduce the behavior: -->\r\n1.
