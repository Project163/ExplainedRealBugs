\r\nI can make a PR, but there's one pesky problem I'm not sure how to approach.\r\n\r\nI wanted to make a test against this new version of `lifecycle-viewmodel`, but it doesn't compile unless we bump LeakCanary's Kotlin version to 1.8+ (because of some ABI incompatibility).\r\n\r\nBumping the Kotlin version forces `when` expression to be always exhaustive, which affects quite a bit of places in the codebase, plus that would probably force LeakCanary users to update their Kotlin version as well, though I'm not sure.\r\n\r\nWe can\r\n1) Skip the test part\r\n2) Update Kotlin and all `when`
