that if the process died (e.g. crash) during an analysis, no heap dumps would happen in the next 10 minutes.\r\n\r\nHeap analysis is now fast, it finds many leaks at once, it's serial and in a single

This means we can remove this behavior and just dump the heap whenever thresholds are met and then enqueue work to the serial service.\r\n\r\nIf the process is killed during an analysis, it won't resume but it's easy enough to import the hprof again, from the sd card.\r\n\r\nFixes #1312","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/square/leakcanary/issues/1315/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/square/leakcanary/issues/1315/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":2306666381,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MjMwNjY2NjM4MQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/square/leakcanary/issues/events/2306666381","actor":{"login":"pyricau","id":557033,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1NzAzMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/557033?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pyricau","html_url":"https://github.com/pyricau","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pyricau/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pyricau/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pyricau/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pyricau/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pyricau/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pyricau/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pyricau/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pyricau/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pyricau/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-04-29T13:20:07Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2306666477,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDIzMDY2NjY0Nzc=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/square/leakcanary/issues/events/2306666477","actor":{"login":"pyricau","id":557033,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1NzAzMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/557033?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pyricau","html_url":"https://github.com/pyricau","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pyricau/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pyricau/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pyricau/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pyricau/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pyricau/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pyricau/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pyricau/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pyricau/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pyricau/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"aeebb3d9fde367c708dd416d064f3f4001265cab","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/square/leakcanary/commits/aeebb3d9fde367c708dd416d064f3f4001265cab","created_at":"2019-04-29T13:20:09Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
