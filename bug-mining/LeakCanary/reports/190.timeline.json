thinking about this lately. The impact will be largely on memory, and not so much on runtime, as we're already going through the entire graph when computing dominators.\r\n\r\nWe need to track of dominators (and update correspondingly) for every instance we visit, from the very beginning. This requires a Map<dominatedObjectId, dominatorObjectId> for potentially each object in the graph. Though we might be able to keep it smaller by using the same trick of assuming \"visited + not in map = dominated from a higher root\" (aka undominated). However at this point it might be worth thinking about replacing the visited set with this.\r\n\r\nAnother related idea that popped up: the queue grows in two dimensions over time: its number of path entries, but also the length of each of its path entries. That's necessary for shortest paths computation. However, once we've found the leaking instances, we keep traversing to compute retained size but we only care about building the domination map, so we could save a bunch of memory by dropping the paths from that point forward.","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/square/leakcanary/issues/comments/694518058/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"pyricau","id":557033,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1NzAzMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/557033?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pyricau","html_url":"https://github.com/pyricau","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pyricau/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pyricau/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pyricau/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pyricau/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pyricau/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pyricau/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pyricau/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pyricau/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pyricau/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":3785591057,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDM3ODU1OTEwNTc=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/square/leakcanary/issues/events/3785591057","actor":{"login":"pyricau","id":557033,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1NzAzMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/557033?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pyricau","html_url":"https://github.com/pyricau","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pyricau/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pyricau/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pyricau/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pyricau/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pyricau/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pyricau/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pyricau/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pyricau/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pyricau/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"503bd946f3618cc17f681e1618dc265bd0e42d89","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/square/leakcanary/commits/503bd946f3618cc17f681e1618dc265bd0e42d89","created_at":"2020-09-19T23:15:29Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"actor":{"login":"pyricau","id":557033,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1NzAzMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/557033?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pyricau","html_url":"https://github.com/pyricau","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pyricau/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pyricau/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pyricau/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pyricau/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pyricau/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pyricau/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pyricau/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pyricau/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pyricau/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-09-19T23:16:11Z","updated_at":"2020-09-19T23:16:11Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/square/leakcanary/issues/1938","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/square/leakcanary","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/square/leakcanary/issues/1938/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/square/leakcanary/issues/1938/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/square/leakcanary/issues/1938/events","html_url":"https://github.com/square/leakcanary/pull/1938","id":705013209,"node_id":"MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0NDg5ODMzNzcz","number":1938,"title":"Compute
