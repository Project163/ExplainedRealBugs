Thanks for the repro case again, that really helped.\r\n\r\nIt's our job as developers to make sure we either use an application context, or cancel toasts when the activity is destroyed (see https://twitter.com/Piwai/status/1334551845000253442). If we use the activity context, then we need to cancel the toast on destroy, and if we don't we get this leak. \r\n\r\nThe `WINDOW_MANAGER_GLOBAL` tagging of `android.view.WindowManagerGlobal#mRoots` as a LibraryLeak was a mistake of mine: this isn't really a library leak, i.e. a bug in AOSP. I added this tagging only to API 27. LeakCanary tries to find a path that doesn't go through any such tag, which is why on API 27 is went through the longer path via `android.view.WindowManagerGlobal#mViews`.\r\n\r\nI'll remove this tag,
