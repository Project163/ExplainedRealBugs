In [version 25.0.2](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/support-library/rev-archive#important-changes_4) of the support library (February 2017), the `FragmentManager.FragmentLifecycleCallbacks` class changed from being an inner non static class (which was a mistake) to being a static class. That means that any code compiled against a later version of `FragmentManager.FragmentLifecycleCallbacks` will fail at runtime because that static class is not included.\r\n\r\nIn our initialization code we check for whether `android.support.v4.app.Fragment` is in the classpath (which is true here) and then try to load `leakcanary.internal.AndroidSupportFragmentDestroyWatcher` which has been compiled against the newer API and therefore fails to load. This leads to `Class.forName` throwing a `NoClassDefFoundError` instead of a `ClassNotFoundException`, which in turns leads to a crash on startup because we don't catch `NoClassDefFoundError`. cc @AndreasBoehm would might find this interesting (we definitely couldn't have thought of
