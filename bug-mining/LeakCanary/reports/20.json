Brrr.\" appears on my application and does not disappear. \nI also get a few ANR while this message is visible (I think this is expected) and always select wait instead of killing the application. \nThe only way to remove the Toast is killing the application.\nTo install the leakcanary I only added the install method on the application class (`LeakCanary.install(this);`). It is necessary to do something more? \n\nOn my device (OnePlus One with Android 5.1.1) I never get this behaviour but on Android emulator with Android 6.0 it happens with some frequency.  \n","closed_by":{"login":"pyricau","id":557033,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1NzAzMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/557033?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pyricau","html_url":"https://github.com/pyricau","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pyricau/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pyricau/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pyricau/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pyricau/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pyricau/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pyricau/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pyricau/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pyricau/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pyricau/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/square/leakcanary/issues/285/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/square/leakcanary/issues/285/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
