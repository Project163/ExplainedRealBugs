Problem description\r\nAbility to disable Leak Canary Heap Dump Toast whenever heapDump is running.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"412\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2021-10-01 at 08 31 36\"

Toast.\r\n\r\nOverride XML\r\n```\r\n <resources>\r\n      <bool name=\"leak_canary_heap_dump_toast\">false</bool>\r\n </resources>\r\n```\r\n\r\nOverride in Code\r\n```\r\nLeakCanary.showLeakToast(isEnabled)\r\n\r\nclass LeakCanary {\r\n  ...\r\n\r\n  fun showLeakToast(showHeapDumpeToast: Boolean) {\r\n    InternalLeakCanary.setEnabledToast(\r\n      \"leakcanary.internal.activity.Toast\", showHeapDumpeToast\r\n    )\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n### Additional information\r\nenabling leakcanary sometimes interrupts engineers workflow since the toast dialog will show and the engineer would waiting for a couple of seconds (even though we already use `leakcanary-android-process`), would be better if we're able to disable the toast dialog and leak canary running silently as we sent the leaks to our server.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/square/leakcanary/issues/2183/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/square/leakcanary/issues/2183/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"actor":{"login":"pyricau","id":557033,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1NzAzMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/557033?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pyricau","html_url":"https://github.com/pyricau","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pyricau/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pyricau/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pyricau/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pyricau/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pyricau/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pyricau/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pyricau/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pyricau/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pyricau/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-12-15T20:57:45Z","updated_at":"2021-12-15T20:57:45Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/square/leakcanary/issues/2184","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/square/leakcanary","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/square/leakcanary/issues/2184/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/square/leakcanary/issues/2184/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/square/leakcanary/issues/2184/events","html_url":"https://github.com/square/leakcanary/pull/2184","id":1012780025,"node_id":"PR_kwDOAhNhM84siPJn","number":2184,"title":"[Feature]
