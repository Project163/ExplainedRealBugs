For example, the Application class sticks around forever while views that are detached should probably be GC'd. With some mechanism to detect these common patterns, we should be able to visually indicate this in the leak trace (and in the text) to narrow down the scope of what needs looked at for each leak and offer a quick place to start in the parts that aren't red/green.\r\n\r\n [1]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7A7Uv9ZBE2U","closed_by":{"login":"pyricau","id":557033,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1NzAzMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/557033?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pyricau","html_url":"https://github.com/pyricau","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pyricau/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pyricau/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pyricau/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pyricau/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pyricau/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pyricau/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pyricau/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pyricau/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pyricau/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/square/leakcanary/issues/727/reactions","total_count":9,"+1":4,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":5,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/square/leakcanary/issues/727/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
