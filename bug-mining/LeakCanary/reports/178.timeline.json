this change, FailTestOnLeakRunListener now hooks into AndroidJUnitRunner when a test run starts to detect if the tests are run by Android Test Orchestrator, in which case we take over the binder callback to send optionally send an extra failure when a leak is detected in test.\r\n\r\nThis works whether newRunListenerMode is false or true (ie whether OrchestratedInstrumentationListener runs before or after FailTestOnLeakRunListener).\r\n\r\nWhen a test finishes without any failure, we intercept any \"test finished\" message, check for memory leaks, optionally send a \"test failure\" message then send the \"test finished message\". This intercepting is done assuming a single thread calls both listeners (see `org.junit.runner.notification.RunNotifier#wrapIfNotThreadSafe`).\r\n\r\nAs before with `Instrumentation.sendStatus()`, the current approach is tied to the test runner implementation details and might have to change to adapt to new `androidx.test:runner` versions.\r\n\r\nOther change: FailTestOnLeakRunListener will wait up to 2 seconds for all activities to be destroyed before running leak detection, and otherwise proceed.\r\n\r\nFixes
