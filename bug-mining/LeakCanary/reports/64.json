Create new android app from \"Empty Activity\" template.\r\n2. Add `LeakCanary` dependency following the **Getting Started** section.\r\n3. Add `ExampleApplication` class with installing `LeakCanary` following the **Getting Started** section.\r\n4. Launch the main app on a device or emulator.\r\n5. Launch the **Leaks** app.\r\n\r\nActual result:\r\n- On step 4, `LeakCanary.isInAnalyzerProcess` returns `false`,\r\n- On step 5, `LeakCanary.isInAnalyzerProcess` returns `false`.\r\n\r\nExpected result:\r\n- On step 4, `LeakCanary.isInAnalyzerProcess` returns `false`,\r\n- On step 5, `LeakCanary.isInAnalyzerProcess` returns `true`.\r\n\r\nThe reason of the issue is that the `HeapAnalyzerService` as well as `DisplayLeakService` are disabled until any first leak happens, and the method `LeakCanaryInternals.isInServiceProcess` does not fetch \"disabled\" components and swallows `PackageManager.NameNotFoundException` by returning `false` in this case.\r\n\r\nIn a simple app, this issue is not critical, but in my case I get `java.lang.IllegalStateException: Default FirebaseApp is not initialized in this process *:leakcanary. Make sure to call FirebaseApp.initializeApp(Context) first.`, which is annoying.\r\n\r\nHere is the sample project to reproduce: [LeakCanaryCheckProcessIssue.zip](https://github.com/square/leakcanary/files/2695123/LeakCanaryCheckProcessIssue.zip)\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"pyricau","id":557033,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1NzAzMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/557033?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pyricau","html_url":"https://github.com/pyricau","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pyricau/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pyricau/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pyricau/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pyricau/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pyricau/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pyricau/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pyricau/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pyricau/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pyricau/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/square/leakcanary/issues/1153/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/square/leakcanary/issues/1153/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
