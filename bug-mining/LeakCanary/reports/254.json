Description\r\n\r\nOn Android 12, the Heap Dump render is buggy.\r\nThe legend _leaks_ through the \"pixel\" records (see screenshots below) and the colors feels washed-out.\r\n\r\nAfter some digging, it appears that since Android 12, the `ANTI_ALIAS_FLAG` is set by default on the `Paint()` default constructor [🔗](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/graphics/Paint#Paint()).\r\n\r\n> On devices running `Build.VERSION_CODES#S` and above, `ANTI_ALIAS_FLAG` is set by this constructor, and it can be cleared with `setFlags(int)` or `setAntiAlias(boolean)`.\r\n\r\nThis explains why drawing points would lead anti-aliasing to blend the individual pixels with the background.\r\n\r\nAlso, I'd like to point out that directly setting the pixels on the bitmap instance would prevent this issue altogether: `bitmap.setPixel(x, y, recordPositions[recordIndex].first)`.\r\nTell me which option you prefer, it might be slightly more efficient to directly modify the Bitmap.\r\n\r\n| Android < 12 |
