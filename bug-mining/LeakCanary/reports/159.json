That's kind of weird. We already know the thing is a thread from the \"thread name\" => remove the concept of \"thread reference\"\r\n* We don't show what the type of the Java objects in the leak trace. It can be deduced but should be highlighted more: \"instance, class, array\". Best is probably to just wrote that after the class name.\r\n* The GC root label is in a confusing position, it's positioned after the name of the element held by the GC Root:\r\n\r\n```\r\n┬\r\n├─ dalvik.system.PathClassLoader\r\n│    GC Root: Local variable in native code\r\n│    ↓ PathClassLoader.runtimeInternalObjects\r\n```\r\n\r\nShould instead be:\r\n\r\n```\r\n┬───\r\n│ GC Root: Local variable in native code\r\n│\r\n├─ dalvik.system.PathClassLoader instance\r\n│    ↓ PathClassLoader.runtimeInternalObjects\r\n```","closed_by":{"login":"pyricau","id":557033,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1NzAzMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/557033?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pyricau","html_url":"https://github.com/pyricau","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pyricau/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pyricau/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pyricau/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pyricau/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pyricau/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pyricau/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pyricau/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pyricau/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pyricau/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/square/leakcanary/issues/1692/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/square/leakcanary/issues/1692/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
