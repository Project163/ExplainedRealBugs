I'm glad we have those logs in place, it helps.\r\n\r\nA few follow up questions:\r\n\r\n* Do you set `LeakCanary.Config.maxStoredHeapDumps` to a value different than the default?\r\n* `automation tests are run with dumpHeap forced on` why do that? Have you seen this? https://square.github.io/leakcanary/recipes/#running-leakcanary-in-instrumentation-tests\r\n\r\nFrom the looks of it, and unless I'm mistaken, this can only happen if there are more than maxStoredHeapDumps heap dumps enqueued and waiting to be analyzed. Heaps dumps are removed by oldest first, so if a non analyzed heap dump is the oldest then all other heap dumps must also be non analyzed yet, since this HeapAnalyzerService is an intent service (serial treatment).\r\n\r\nWe could probably detect that situation by tracking start commands (https://stackoverflow.com/a/28648443/703646) . \r\n\r\nSo the first step is to evaluate whether this is actually happening and why.\r\n\r\nThe next question is.. what to do when that happens.
