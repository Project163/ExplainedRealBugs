far as I know, Fragments are never resuscitated after receiving their on destroy callback.\r\n\r\nHistorically, the FragmentManager would clear out the manager instance when the fragment is destroyed: https://cs.android.com/android/platform/superproject/main/+/main:frameworks/base/core/java/android/app/FragmentManager.java;l=1470;drc=406e0f655387f27dda874c2b975fb0ddbd61aa13\r\n\r\nInterestingly, it looks like the implementation in the AndroidX fragment has changed, the FragmentManager is set to null in detach: https://cs.android.com/androidx/platform/frameworks/support/+/androidx-main:fragment/fragment/src/main/java/androidx/fragment/app/FragmentStateManager.java;l=868;drc=6899e1031ecb6d9421c0e986a9290388c84e8a27\r\n\r\nDo you have a working example / repro where you're able to detach then reattach a fragment, and LeakCanary is reporting a leak anyway?\r\n\r\nIt looks like we might need to change how we detect leaks for android x fragments in Shark.\r\n\r\nFrom what I can tell, we could switch to looking into `androidx.fragment.app.Fragment.mLifecycleRegistry.state` and see if that's equal to `State.DESTROYED`: https://cs.android.com/androidx/platform/frameworks/support/+/androidx-main:fragment/fragment/src/main/java/androidx/fragment/app/Fragment.java;l=3373;drc=ff6e33e5915d8e253d1a6be79c7015ef61848522\r\n\r\nThe state field was named `mState` prior to the conversion to Kotlin so we'll also have to account for that:\r\n\r\nhttps://cs.android.com/androidx/platform/frameworks/support/+/36833f9ab0c50bf449fc795e297a0e124df3356e:lifecycle/lifecycle-runtime/src/main/java/androidx/lifecycle/LifecycleRegistry.kt;dlc=19acbc4b7d73c6bcf1b023658ccece32d76f28cd\r\n\r\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/square/leakcanary/issues/comments/1873820762/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"pyricau","id":557033,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1NzAzMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/557033?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pyricau","html_url":"https://github.com/pyricau","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pyricau/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pyricau/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pyricau/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pyricau/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pyricau/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pyricau/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pyricau/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pyricau/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pyricau/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":11368772428,"node_id":"LE_lADOAhNhM85wKtXozwAAAAKlobNM","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/square/leakcanary/issues/events/11368772428","actor":{"login":"pyricau","id":557033,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1NzAzMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/557033?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pyricau","html_url":"https://github.com/pyricau","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pyricau/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pyricau/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pyricau/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pyricau/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pyricau/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pyricau/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pyricau/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pyricau/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pyricau/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2024-01-02T10:03:31Z","label":{"name":"type:
