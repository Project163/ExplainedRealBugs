is the reopen for #1573 as suggested in https://github.com/square/leakcanary/issues/1573#issuecomment-839154311. \r\nSo on Android 11 (API 30) I caught this leak when trying to add custom URLSpan to SpannableStringBuilder (for setting into TextView, also with LinkMovementMethod).\r\nI have found only generic SO post about such situations - https://stackoverflow.com/questions/28539216/android-textview-leaks-with-setmovementmethod and comment https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/146100180#comment6\r\nThe workaround suggested in https://stackoverflow.com/a/53202503/2190250) seems working.\r\n\r\n```\r\nfun getClickableSpannedString(text: CharSequence, context: Context): CharSequence {\r\n  val resultBuilder = SpannableString(text)\r\n  \r\n  val span = object : URLSpan(\"some data\") {\r\n      override fun onClick(widget: View) {\r\n          // some use of Context passed in function, like opening web page or just context.startActivity\r\n      }\r\n  }\r\n  \r\n  // add to resultBuilder \r\n  resultBuilder.setSpan(span,\r\n                  ...,\r\n                  ...,\r\n                  Spanned.SPAN_EXCLUSIVE_EXCLUSIVE)\r\n  \r\n  return resultBuilder\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### LeakTrace information\r\n```\r\n​\r\n┬───\r\n│ GC Root: Global variable in native code\r\n│\r\n├─
