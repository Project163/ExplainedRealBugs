discussed in [here](https://github.com/square/leakcanary/issues/650#issuecomment-547661243), this is another leak of `EditText`(or any other subclass of it) that does not get destroyed every time it gets focused and retains the `mContext` until the focus gets shifted to another `EditText`. Please note that `mContext` is destroyed as soon as the focus gets shifted to another `EditText` and again a new `mContext` is retained.\r\nLet me know if more info needed.\r\n### LeakTrace information\r\n\r\nLeak trace generated on API 23 LG Nexus 5 although when tested on higher versions the leak is gone.\r\nSteps to reproduce: Simple just use an `EditText` anywhere inside activity and make sure it's focused and after `Activity.onDestroy()` you will get the leak.\r\n\r\n```\r\nApplicationLeak(className=com.colevit.furmate.module.container.ContainerActivity, leakTrace=\r\n┬\r\n├─ java.lang.Thread\r\n│    Leaking: UNKNOWN\r\n│    Thread name: 'Studio:InputCon'\r\n│    GC Root: Java local variable\r\n│    ↓ thread Thread.<Java Local>\r\n│                    ~~~~~~~~~~~~\r\n├─ com.android.tools.profiler.support.event.InputConnectionWrapper\r\n│    Leaking: UNKNOWN\r\n│    ↓ InputConnectionWrapper.mTarget\r\n│                             ~~~~~~~\r\n├─ com.android.internal.widget.EditableInputConnection\r\n│    Leaking: UNKNOWN\r\n│    ↓ EditableInputConnection.mTargetView\r\n│                              ~~~~~~~~~~~\r\n├─ androidx.appcompat.widget.AppCompatEditText\r\n│    Leaking: YES (View.mContext references a destroyed activity)\r\n│    mContext instance of android.view.ContextThemeWrapper, wrapping activity com.colevit.furmate.module.container.ContainerActivity with mDestroyed = true\r\n│    View#mParent is set\r\n│    View#mAttachInfo is null (view detached)\r\n│    View.mWindowAttachCount = 1\r\n│    ↓ AppCompatEditText.mContext\r\n├─ android.view.ContextThemeWrapper\r\n│    Leaking: YES (AppCompatEditText↑ is leaking and ContextThemeWrapper wraps an Activity with Activity.mDestroyed true)\r\n│    ↓ ContextThemeWrapper.mBase\r\n╰→ com.colevit.furmate.module.container.ContainerActivity\r\n​     Leaking: YES (ContextThemeWrapper↑ is leaking and Activity#mDestroyed is true and ObjectWatcher was watching this)\r\n​     key = 618d2116-4c2d-4118-ab3a-a9b5d6f8ae68\r\n​     watchDurationMillis = 7833\r\n​     retainedDurationMillis = 2833\r\n, retainedHeapByteSize=7447)\r\n```\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/square/leakcanary/issues/1610/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/square/leakcanary/issues/1610/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
