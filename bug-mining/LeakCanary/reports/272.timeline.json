Description\r\n\r\n- FtpTileService convert to Kotlin\r\n- Replace EventBus with kotlinx.coroutines\r\n- FtpServerFragment update code to recommended\r\n- FtpService explicitly acquires wakelock and

break FtpService when device screen is turned off\r\n\r\n#### Issue tracker   \r\nFixes #4125\r\n\r\n#### Automatic tests\r\n- [ ] Added test cases\r\n  \r\n#### Manual tests\r\n- [x] Done  \r\n
