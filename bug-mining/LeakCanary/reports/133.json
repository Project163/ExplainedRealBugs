Is there anything that we can do to improve ?\r\n\r\nThe leak tracker is initialized with:\r\n\r\n```\r\nLeakCanary.config = LeakCanary.config.copy(\r\n                computeRetainedHeapSize = true,\r\n                dumpHeap = true,\r\n                dumpHeapWhenDebugging = true,\r\n                retainedVisibleThreshold = 0,\r\n                referenceMatchers = getWhitelistLeaks())\r\n\r\n        AppWatcher.config = AppWatcher.config.copy(\r\n                enabled = true,\r\n                watchActivities = true,\r\n                watchFragmentViews = true,\r\n                watchDurationMillis = TimeUnit.SECONDS.toMillis(10))\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n[Provide a sample project, a .hprof file or a failing test]\r\n\r\n1.
