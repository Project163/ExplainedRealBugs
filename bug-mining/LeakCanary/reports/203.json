Run sample\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior:** Work perfectly before API 19\r\n\r\n### Version Information\r\n\r\n* LeakCanary version: main branch\r\n* Android OS version: 4.1.1, 4.0.3\r\n* Gradle version: 6.5\r\n\r\n### Additional Information\r\n\r\n* `WindowManagerGlobal` added by API 17, but `mViews` still array before API 19.\r\n* Before API 19, `mViews` is a `View[]`. That means we can not make a sub class of `ArrayList` and override `add` method to handle `root view added` event.\r\n* ~~(__Maybe a solution__) Hook `WindowManagerImpl.sWindowManager` and set a dynamic proxy to it. Then track the call of [void addView(View view, ViewGroup.LayoutParams params, CompatibilityInfoHolder cih, boolean nest)](https://android.googlesource.com/platform/frameworks/base/+/refs/tags/android-4.1.2_r2.1/core/java/android/view/WindowManagerImpl.java#227). When addView is invoked, we can notify that the root view(the first parameter of `addView`) has been added.~~","closed_by":{"login":"pyricau","id":557033,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1NzAzMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/557033?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pyricau","html_url":"https://github.com/pyricau","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pyricau/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pyricau/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pyricau/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pyricau/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pyricau/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pyricau/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pyricau/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pyricau/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pyricau/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/square/leakcanary/issues/2016/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/square/leakcanary/issues/2016/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
