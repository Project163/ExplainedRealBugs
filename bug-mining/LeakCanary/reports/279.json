Launch LeakActivity on an app with enough number of leaks\r\n2. Select `Heap Dumps` bottom tab, scroll to bottom most and tap to view details\r\n3. Navigate back\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior:** List position should be preserved instead of resetting to top. This isn't a big deal except for legacy project using Leak Canary for first time (tends to have quite a few entries) and navigation isn't friendly.\r\n\r\n### Version Information\r\n\r\n* LeakCanary version: 2.11\r\n* Android OS version: Android 11\r\n* Gradle version: 7.5\r\n\r\n### Additional Information\r\n\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/square/leakcanary/assets/1020585/2738471b-8b5e-4202-991e-5ad117343c7d\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"pyricau","id":557033,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1NzAzMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/557033?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pyricau","html_url":"https://github.com/pyricau","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pyricau/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pyricau/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pyricau/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pyricau/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pyricau/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pyricau/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pyricau/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pyricau/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pyricau/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/square/leakcanary/issues/2531/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/square/leakcanary/issues/2531/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
