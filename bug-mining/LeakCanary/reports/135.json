}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\nFollow the documentation to run heap analysis in a separate process by replacing the normal `leakcanary-android` dependency with `leakcanary-android-process`. \r\n\r\n1. Open Leaks activity\r\n2. Import any hprof file for analysis\r\n3. Note crash\r\n\r\nThe same crash also happens if the analysis happens because of routine usage of the app.\r\n\r\n### Version Information\r\n\r\n* LeakCanary version: v2-beta3\r\n* Android OS version: 28\r\n* Gradle version: 5.1\r\n\r\n### Additional Information\r\n\r\nN/A - Don't do any custom configuration, this is using the defaults and automatic setup that leak canary applies.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"pyricau","id":557033,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1NzAzMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/557033?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pyricau","html_url":"https://github.com/pyricau","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pyricau/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pyricau/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pyricau/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pyricau/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pyricau/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pyricau/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pyricau/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pyricau/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pyricau/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/square/leakcanary/issues/1584/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/square/leakcanary/issues/1584/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
