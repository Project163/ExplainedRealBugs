Removed \"computeIgnoredBitmapRetainedSize\": we added this hack because some bitmaps were not added to the total retained sized because they had a native gc root dominator. This only worked pre M because we looked at mBuffer which went away. The updated perflib looks up in native land and updates the Bitmap objects to the correct native size. This change means we now get the exact same retained size in Android Studio & LeakCanary. Unless we build our own heap dump parser, it's probably better to just rely on perflib for retained size. \r\n* HAHA now ignores missing native threads instead of creating an empty snapshot.\r\n* HAHA 2.1 has Java 8 bytecode, which means LeakCanary consumers are now expected to support Java 8 bytecode. This is a breaking change that will go in a 2.0 release.\r\n\r\nFixes #1133 (update to latest perflib)\r\nFixes #1124
