Switched to HAHA 2.0.2 which is based on perflib instead of MAT\n- AnalysisResult.failure is now a `Throwable` instead of an `Exception`. Main goal is to catch and correctly report OOMs while parsing.\n- Added ARRAY_ENTRY to LeakTraceElement.Type for references through array entries.\n- Huge speed improvements when performing the shortest path with excluded references: it's now tailored to our needs instead of doing it on a loop.\n- Renamed `ExcludedRefs` fields.\n- Each `ExcludedRef` entry can now be ignored entirely or \"kept only if no other path\".\n- Added support for ignoring all fields (static and non static) for a given class.\n- Improved the heap dump analyzer test and added a heap dump for M Preview 2.\n- Bumped version to 1.4-SNAPSHOT because this breaks the APIs.\n- [x] Implement shortest path algorithms\n- [x] Publish HAHA 2.0\n- [x] Figure out why we need 50Mb of heap to parse a heapdump on M => #223\n- [x] Fix unit tests\n- [x] Revert to String UUIDs\n- [x] Clean the
