Then I realized that probably wasn't a good idea for backward compatibility and reverted. Everything looks right in terms of project setup, and yet, somehow `leakcanary-android-core` in alpha 2 is a module with that single shared class. Very weird, I don't know what I did.\r\n\r\nThat release is borked, I'll make a new
