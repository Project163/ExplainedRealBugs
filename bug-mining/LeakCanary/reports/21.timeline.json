LeakCanary limits the number of dumps it stores (in order to not clog up the system). The problem with this system is that you can lose valuable leak data if you haven't been manually cleaning out your dumps every so often.\n\nThere's a few possible solutions to the problem:\n- Notification when full\n- Remove oldest one when full\n- No limit, grows forever until out of disk space\n- Don’t keep heap dumps, only leak traces.\n- Only keep last heap dump\n\nI'd like to come up with a better solution but obviously we should discuss it first.\n\n---\n\nPersonally my vote is for \"no limit\" but add a helpful notification when LeakCanary is taking up a large amount of disk space. That way you never lose any data (unless disk is full), the behavior is simple, but it doesn't pull a fast one on the developer by filling their HD
