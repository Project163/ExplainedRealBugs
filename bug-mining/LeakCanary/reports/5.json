It's fairly easy to do so in MAT.\n\nHowever, it might be useful to create a shorcut by providing the state information (instance fields) for each of the reference in the chain. ie for each of those fields, give the type & memory address.\n\nThat would be something separate from the leak trace string, ie available as fields in it and maybe through a `toDetailedString()` method. We might want `leakInfo()` to include that as well.\n","closed_by":{"login":"swankjesse","id":133019,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMzAxOQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/133019?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/swankjesse","html_url":"https://github.com/swankjesse","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swankjesse/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swankjesse/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swankjesse/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swankjesse/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swankjesse/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swankjesse/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swankjesse/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swankjesse/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swankjesse/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/square/leakcanary/issues/13/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/square/leakcanary/issues/13/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
