happens on master (post 1.5.4), Android O\r\n\r\nRepro steps:\r\n\r\n* Install LeakCanary sample\r\n* Trigger a leak (prior to having granted sd card permission)\r\n* Once the leak is correctly detected and analysed, grant permissions\r\n* Go into the list of leaks and attempt to share the heap dump for that leak\r\n=> crash\r\n\r\nThis likely happens because that first leak was created prior to having the sdcard permission, so it was created in the app directly.\r\n\r\n```\r\n06-16 14:43:38.862 8720-9167/com.example.leakcanary:leakcanary E/AndroidRuntime: FATAL EXCEPTION: AsyncTask
