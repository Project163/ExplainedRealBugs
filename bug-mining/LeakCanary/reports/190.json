In many caused, the leak originates higher in the leak trace, which means there are many more objects leaking and the retained size is actually much higher than what we report.\r\n\r\nLeakCanary rarely knows exactly which reference is causing the leak (unless there's only one possible cause, and even that isn't always 100% certain), so the idea here is to compute the retained size for each object and add that to the leak trace output, under each object. As such, we should see the value decrease as we get closer to the leaking object.\r\n\r\nThis will require some changes in PathFinder. Need to evaluate the impact on runtime performance.","closed_by":{"login":"pyricau","id":557033,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1NzAzMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/557033?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pyricau","html_url":"https://github.com/pyricau","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pyricau/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pyricau/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pyricau/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pyricau/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pyricau/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pyricau/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pyricau/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pyricau/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pyricau/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/square/leakcanary/issues/1880/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/square/leakcanary/issues/1880/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
