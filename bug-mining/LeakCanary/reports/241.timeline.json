I think I understand what's going on : \r\n\r\nI'm not using any animator but MaterialButton does it internally for the ripple effect. On my app, once the user taps on a button it starts a new fragment **right way** and the ripple effect **does not end before the fragment transaction occurs.**\r\n\r\nIn the same time, I found this issue on Google Issue Tracker (reported by you maybe?) : https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/212993949\r\n\r\nI think this is the same root cause. If a user clicks a button and the ripple effect animation does not end before the fragment is replaced then the view leaks probably because Android does not cancel the animation. \r\n\r\nIf I set a delay of 2 seconds to let the button complete its ripple animation before the fragment transaction -> the view is not leaking anymore\r\n\r\nSo that's probably an ASOP issue.\r\n\r\nPS : to reproduce the issue, we simply need to click a button and \"replace\" (+ \"addToBackStack\") current fragment by another one =/","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/square/leakcanary/issues/comments/1098446281/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"Moradious","id":86958316,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg2OTU4MzE2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/86958316?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Moradious","html_url":"https://github.com/Moradious","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Moradious/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Moradious/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Moradious/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Moradious/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Moradious/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Moradious/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Moradious/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Moradious/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Moradious/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/square/leakcanary/issues/comments/1098461958","html_url":"https://github.com/square/leakcanary/issues/2341#issuecomment-1098461958","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/square/leakcanary/issues/2341","id":1098461958,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAhNhM85BeTMG","user":{"login":"pyricau","id":557033,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1NzAzMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/557033?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pyricau","html_url":"https://github.com/pyricau","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pyricau/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pyricau/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pyricau/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pyricau/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pyricau/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pyricau/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pyricau/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pyricau/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pyricau/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-04-13T20:33:46Z","updated_at":"2022-04-13T20:33:46Z","body":"I did file that issue, and looking more closely now I actually think they're different issues.
