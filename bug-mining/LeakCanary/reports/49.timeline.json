level design proposal:\r\n\r\n* We introduce some sort of node oracle interface, with a method like `ExpectedState readState(LeakNode node)`, `ExpectedState` being an enum of `UNKNOWN, DEAD, ALIVE`\r\n* We provide an API for registering a set of oracles. Those will run with the analysis service\r\n* We provide a default set of standard oracles: Fragments / Activities / Services can be created / destroyed, views can be attached / detached. Application stays for ever, same with a bunch of other classes.\r\n* We pass each node of the leak trace through the set of oracles, trying to eliminate as many \"unknown\" as possible.\r\n* we apply the formula to simplify: if element dead, all elements further should be dead. if element alive, all elements before should be alive\r\n* We figure out some way to display that in the string and in display leak activity. I'm wondering if we should also display the exact elements that got matches as well, with their rules, to make it very clear.\r\nInstead of just \"red / green\", the display should also highlight the places where the leak might be.

If you want to ask how to do\r\n   something, or to understand why something isn't working the way you expect it to, use Stack\r\n   Overflow: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/leakcanary.\r\n\r\n - *Help me fix a leak?*: Please do not file an issue.\r\n   Instead, read here: https://github.com/square/leakcanary/#how-do-i-fix-a-memory-leak\r\n \r\n - *Leak analysis failed*: if it's an OutOfMemoryError, no need to report it. See https://github.com/square/leakcanary/wiki/Future#low-memory-leak-analysis\r\n\r\n - *Bug report*: If you’ve found a bug, spend the time to write a failing test. Bugs with tests get fixed.\r\n   Here’s an example: https://gist.github.com/swankjesse/981fcae102f513eb13ed\r\n   \r\n - *Feature Request*: Start by telling us what problem you’re trying to solve. Don’t send pull requests to implement\r\n   new features without first getting our support. Sometimes we leave features out on purpose to keep the project small.\r\n\r\n^^^^^ DELETE FROM THIS LINE UP ^^^^^\r\n\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n{REPLACE THIS LINE WITH YOUR STACKTRACE OR OUTPUT FROM LEAKCANARY}\r\n\r\n```\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/square/leakcanary/issues/1141/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/square/leakcanary/issues/1141/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
