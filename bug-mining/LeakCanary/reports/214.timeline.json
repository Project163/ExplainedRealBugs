Sometimes after Activity.onDestroy(), there’s a “final cleanup” callback that ensures all registered receivers and unregistered, and drops a message in logcat yelling at you because you should have done that already. However, here, we’re using a post delayed so we are registering to the destroyed activity AFTER the cleanup has happened. The proper behavior would likely be for Android to throw an exception (don’t register on a destroyed activity) or at least a log + no-op. However this goes through just fine.\r\n\r\nThe receiver itself does not hold any reference to the activity, which will make that leak really hard to track, because this bad registration won’t be visible anywhere in the leak
