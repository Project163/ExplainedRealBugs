If it's set, we assume the view should be reachable. If it's null, we assume it should be unreachable.\r\n\r\nProblems:\r\n\r\n* We have a dedicated inspector (AndroidReachabilityInspectors.ViewImplInspector) that looks at ViewRootImpl.mAttachInfo, however that's always been final so really we should remove that inspector.\r\n* Toast always holds an unattached LinearLayout (nextView).
