Description\r\n\r\nI've found a crash that happened to me after triggering a known leak in my application.  I've loosely documented the leak and how the crash is triggered through [this StackOverflow question post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/70178226/mediasession-is-leaking-in-audio-app-with-leakcanary-crash), but wanted to file the crash separately for completion's sake.  Also, it may bring about more visibility to my initial questions as well!\r\n\r\nHere's the crash stacktrace: \r\n```\r\nFatal Exception: android.app.ForegroundServiceStartNotAllowedException: startForegroundService() not allowed due to mAllowStartForeground false: service com.mixhalo.mixhaloclient.debug/leakcanary.internal.HeapAnalyzerService\r\n       at android.app.ForegroundServiceStartNotAllowedException$1.createFromParcel(ForegroundServiceStartNotAllowedException.java:54)\r\n       at android.app.ForegroundServiceStartNotAllowedException$1.createFromParcel(ForegroundServiceStartNotAllowedException.java:50)\r\n       at android.os.Parcel.readParcelable(Parcel.java:3333)\r\n       at android.os.Parcel.createExceptionOrNull(Parcel.java:2420)\r\n       at android.os.Parcel.createException(Parcel.java:2409)\r\n       at android.os.Parcel.readException(Parcel.java:2392)\r\n       at android.os.Parcel.readException(Parcel.java:2334)\r\n       at android.app.IActivityManager$Stub$Proxy.startService(IActivityManager.java:5971)\r\n       at java.lang.reflect.Method.invoke(Method.java)\r\n       at leakcanary.ServiceWatcher$install$4$2.invoke(ServiceWatcher.kt:85)\r\n       at java.lang.reflect.Proxy.invoke(Proxy.java:1006)\r\n       at $Proxy3.startService()\r\n       at android.app.ContextImpl.startServiceCommon(ContextImpl.java:1847)\r\n       at android.app.ContextImpl.startForegroundService(ContextImpl.java:1823)\r\n       at android.content.ContextWrapper.startForegroundService(ContextWrapper.java:779)\r\n       at leakcanary.internal.HeapAnalyzerService$Companion.startForegroundService(HeapAnalyzerService.kt:149)\r\n       at leakcanary.internal.HeapAnalyzerService$Companion.runAnalysis(HeapAnalyzerService.kt:141)\r\n       at leakcanary.internal.HeapDumpTrigger.dumpHeap(HeapDumpTrigger.kt:186)\r\n       at leakcanary.internal.HeapDumpTrigger.checkRetainedObjects(HeapDumpTrigger.kt:150)\r\n       at leakcanary.internal.HeapDumpTrigger.access$checkRetainedObjects(HeapDumpTrigger.kt:29)\r\n       at leakcanary.internal.HeapDumpTrigger$scheduleRetainedObjectCheck$1.run(HeapDumpTrigger.kt:334)\r\n       at android.os.Handler.handleCallback(Handler.java:938)\r\n       at android.os.Handler.dispatchMessage(Handler.java:99)\r\n       at android.os.Looper.loopOnce(Looper.java:201)\r\n       at android.os.Looper.loop(Looper.java:288)\r\n       at android.os.HandlerThread.run(HandlerThread.java:67)\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n*NOTE:* I'll work on a sample application tomorrow to better showcase this scenario.\r\n\r\n1. Open application\r\n2. Start playing audio through the `MediaBrowserService`\r\n3. Dismiss application from the app overview screen\r\n4. Wait for about 10-15 seconds and wait for crash to happen\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior:** LeakCanary doesn't crash and instead dumps the heap and shows if there's any potential leaks happening\r\n\r\n### Version Information\r\n\r\n* LeakCanary version: 2.7\r\n* Android OS version: 12\r\n* Gradle version: 7.0.2\r\n\r\n### Additional Information\r\n\r\nI should mention that if the application is quickly re-opened after closing it out from the app overview screen, the same session of the app will be opened and LeakCanary will detect the leaking object and not crash.  This extra steps have allowed to me gather the leak report found in the StackOverflow question from before.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/square/leakcanary/issues/2205/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/square/leakcanary/issues/2205/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/square/leakcanary/issues/comments/995337270","html_url":"https://github.com/square/leakcanary/issues/2192#issuecomment-995337270","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/square/leakcanary/issues/2192","id":995337270,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAhNhM847U6Q2","user":{"login":"pyricau","id":557033,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1NzAzMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/557033?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pyricau","html_url":"https://github.com/pyricau","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pyricau/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pyricau/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pyricau/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pyricau/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pyricau/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pyricau/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pyricau/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pyricau/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pyricau/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-12-16T00:50:32Z","updated_at":"2021-12-16T00:50:32Z","body":"Interesting,
