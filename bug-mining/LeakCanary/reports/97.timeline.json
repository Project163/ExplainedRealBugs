Removed HeapDumpMemoryStore\r\n* Simplified the \"retained\" concept by introducing a retained time for each weak ref. Then for all hprof old and new we just look at KeyedWeakReference instances which became retained before the heap dump time. If the field is missing (older hprofs) we assume all instances are retained.\r\n* This simplified a bunch of edge cases and removed the need to reporting cleared and missing references.\r\n* Also removed AnalysisBenchmarkTest which was ignored and didn't work.\r\n* Added RefWatcher.retainedInstances that can be used for logging purposes.\r\n\r\nFixes #1366","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/square/leakcanary/issues/1414/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/square/leakcanary/issues/1414/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":2442440955,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MjQ0MjQ0MDk1NQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/square/leakcanary/issues/events/2442440955","actor":{"login":"pyricau","id":557033,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1NzAzMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/557033?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pyricau","html_url":"https://github.com/pyricau","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pyricau/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pyricau/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pyricau/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pyricau/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pyricau/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pyricau/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pyricau/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pyricau/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pyricau/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-06-26T23:04:15Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2442441053,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDI0NDI0NDEwNTM=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/square/leakcanary/issues/events/2442441053","actor":{"login":"pyricau","id":557033,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1NzAzMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/557033?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pyricau","html_url":"https://github.com/pyricau","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pyricau/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pyricau/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pyricau/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pyricau/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pyricau/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pyricau/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pyricau/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pyricau/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pyricau/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"86bf8a415b0b594c9715bd0659ff4906167ccf67","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/square/leakcanary/commits/86bf8a415b0b594c9715bd0659ff4906167ccf67","created_at":"2019-06-26T23:04:18Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
