It stores leak specific information in separate files and uses that to display the leaks, the hprof is never parsed again.\r\n\r\nHere's the way I've thought of this in the past (doesn't mean it's right):\r\n\r\n* We automatically report the leaktrace strings to a backend that groups the identical ones and counts them. Exactly like crashes. In fact, I use a crash reporter for that (Bugsnag), which is why I added `AnalysisResult.leakTraceAsFakeException()`. I then add the \"leak info\" as metadata on the fake crash. The leak info has exactly the same amount of information as what we display on screen.\r\n* If LeakCanary doesn't provide enough details to solve the problem, export the hprof and open in YourKit and manually poke around.\r\n\r\nMy thoughts on this are that the best approach might be similar to what we're doing with bugsnag, ie automatically uploading leak traces to an internal backend, but presenting them in a nicer way than just text. Of course, that's a lot of work :) . Anyway, it sounds like you had something different in mind (reimport on phone), and I've never thought of that, so I'd be curious to know why you'd like that better / what would be nice about it.","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/square/leakcanary/issues/comments/401364033/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"pyricau","id":557033,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1NzAzMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/557033?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pyricau","html_url":"https://github.com/pyricau","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pyricau/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pyricau/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pyricau/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pyricau/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pyricau/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pyricau/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pyricau/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pyricau/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pyricau/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/square/leakcanary/issues/comments/401406252","html_url":"https://github.com/square/leakcanary/issues/1040#issuecomment-401406252","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/square/leakcanary/issues/1040","id":401406252,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQwMTQwNjI1Mg==","user":{"login":"eygraber","id":1100381,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMDAzODE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1100381?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/eygraber","html_url":"https://github.com/eygraber","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eygraber/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eygraber/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eygraber/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eygraber/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eygraber/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eygraber/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eygraber/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eygraber/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eygraber/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-06-29T16:29:21Z","updated_at":"2018-06-29T16:29:21Z","body":"I was thinking something simpler along the lines of storing the hprof in a shared Google Drive with a link to it in our issue tracker.
