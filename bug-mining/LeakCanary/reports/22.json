The heap dump itself is 13Mb.\n\nI've been playing with perflib and with MAT to figure this out.\n\nMAT says that the heap dump has 48172 unique roots. An object can be a GC root for more than one reason, so here's the decomposition:\n\nTHREAD_OBJ=15\nNATIVE_STACK=295\nSYSTEM_CLASS=197490\nUNKNOWN=44338\n\nPerflib finds ~200K GC Roots, which corresponds.\n\nI started digging, and I found that there are only 3802 unique objects that are a gc root as a \"System Class\" at least once.\n\nIn other words, the heap dump contains the same information over and over again, on average 50 times per class.\n","closed_by":{"login":"pyricau","id":557033,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1NzAzMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/557033?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pyricau","html_url":"https://github.com/pyricau","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pyricau/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pyricau/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pyricau/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pyricau/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pyricau/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pyricau/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pyricau/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pyricau/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pyricau/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/square/leakcanary/issues/223/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/square/leakcanary/issues/223/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
