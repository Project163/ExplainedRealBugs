ViewGroupChildListForAccessibility. obtain is called with `sort` set to true.\r\n\r\nIn other words, as far as I can see, ViewGroup.ViewLocationHolder is only ever used as a temporary object to sort

If I dump the heap later on, I don't see the ReportFragment object that LeakCanary is mentioning (or multiple Activities).\r\n\r\nStill, the documentation of LeakCanary doesn't seem to be saying what I should do about this problem. Should I somehow add this to the excluded list—but then, how do I add the “No leak found” there? Or perhaps I am supposed to live with this, ignoring the notifications?\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nThe leak happens when tapping a popup menu item that calls `recreate()`:\r\n\r\n```\r\nIn lv.s.reportfragmentleak:1.0:1.\r\n* androidx.lifecycle.ReportFragment has leaked:\r\n* RenderNodeAnimator.mTarget\r\n* ↳ RenderNode.mOwningView\r\n* ↳ MenuPopupWindow$MenuDropDownListView.!(mHoverListener)!\r\n* ↳ MenuPopupWindow.!(mPopup)!\r\n* ↳ AppCompatPopupWindow.!(mExitTransition)!\r\n* ↳ Fade.!(mCurrentAnimators)!\r\n* ↳ ArrayList.!(elementData)!\r\n* ↳ array Object[].!([0])!\r\n* ↳ ObjectAnimator.!(mListeners)!\r\n* ↳ ArrayList.!(elementData)!\r\n* ↳ array Object[].!([2])!\r\n* ↳ Transition$2.!(this$0)!

Both the fab and the menu `recreate()` the activity, tapping on the fab works fine but tapping on the menu item leads to the leak. Interestingly, if you look at the provided heap, it contains 11 MainActivity instances, but LeakCanary doesn't complain about those.\r\n\r\nI was unable to replicate the issue on other devices/Android versions; on every system tapping on the menu reliably triggers LeakCanary, but on android 7.1.2 and P (emulated) this always leads to the “No leak found” notification. This might be explained by the fact that both of these devices are *much* slower than my main device running Android One 8.1.0. \r\n\r\n(Also I'm getting this chrash on 7.1.2, which looks exactly like #844:\r\n\r\n```\r\n2018-10-28 00:29:52.720 8317-8317/lv.s.reportfragmentleak E/AndroidRuntime: FATAL EXCEPTION: main\r\n    Process: lv.s.reportfragmentleak, PID: 8317\r\n    android.view.WindowManager$BadTokenException: Unable to add window -- token android.os.BinderProxy@775c69b is not valid; is your activity running?\r\n        at android.view.ViewRootImpl.setView(ViewRootImpl.java:679)\r\n        at android.view.WindowManagerGlobal.addView(WindowManagerGlobal.java:342)\r\n        at android.view.WindowManagerImpl.addView(WindowManagerImpl.java:94)\r\n        at android.widget.Toast$TN.handleShow(Toast.java:459)\r\n        at android.widget.Toast$TN$2.handleMessage(Toast.java:342)\r\n        at android.os.Handler.dispatchMessage(Handler.java:102)\r\n        at android.os.Looper.loop(Looper.java:154)\r\n        at android.app.ActivityThread.main(ActivityThread.java:6186)\r\n        at java.lang.reflect.Method.invoke(Native Method)\r\n        at com.android.internal.os.ZygoteInit$MethodAndArgsCaller.run(ZygoteInit.java:889)\r\n        at com.android.internal.os.ZygoteInit.main(ZygoteInit.java:779)\r\n```\r\n\r\n...which might be related to a very similar leak that mentions a Toast in my actual application:\r\n\r\n```\r\nIn com.ubergeek42.WeechatAndroid.debug:0.13-debug:437.\r\n* androidx.lifecycle.ReportFragment has leaked:\r\n* Toast$TN.mNextView\r\n* ↳ LinearLayout.mParent\r\n* ↳ ViewRootImpl.!(mChoreographer)!\r\n* ↳ Choreographer.!(mCallbackQueues)!\r\n* ↳ array Choreographer$CallbackQueue[].!([1])!\r\n* ↳ Choreographer$CallbackQueue.!(mHead)!\r\n* ↳ Choreographer$CallbackRecord.!(action)!\r\n* ↳ AnimationHandler$1.!(this$0)!

I know it's a real issue, and LeakCanary reporting it means that LeakCanary is doing its job correctly. However, because we have no control over fixing it, being notified every time it happens isn't particularly useful.  The other alternative would be to disable LeakCanary entirely for the app which would be throwing out the baby with the bathwater. \r\n\r\nEdit: I see there is [AndroidExcludedRefs.java](https://github.com/square/leakcanary/blob/master/leakcanary-android/src/main/java/com/squareup/leakcanary/AndroidExcludedRefs.java). Seems like this leak should be included in the list.\r\n\r\nEdit2: This leak is included in AndroidExcludedRefs.java, but it is not `alwaysExclude()`'d. Using the following code also still triggers memory leaks. Is this a valid way to exclude leaks? If so,  I'll unfortunately have to disable LeakCanary on Android P.\r\n\r\n```kotlin\r\npackage com.squareup.leakcanary\r\n\r\nimport android.app.Application\r\nimport com.squareup.leakcanary.AndroidExcludedRefs.VIEWLOCATIONHOLDER_ROOT\r\n\r\nfun buildAndInstallLeakCanary(app: Application) {\r\n  val excludedRefsBuilder: ExcludedRefs.Builder = ExcludedRefs.builder()\r\n\r\n  AndroidExcludedRefs\r\n      .values()\r\n      .filter { it.applies }\r\n      .forEach { ref ->\r\n        if (ref == VIEWLOCATIONHOLDER_ROOT) {\r\n          excludedRefsBuilder\r\n              .instanceField(\"android.view.ViewGroup\\$ViewLocationHolder\", \"mRoot\")\r\n              .alwaysExclude()\r\n              .staticField(\"android.view.ViewGroup\\$ViewLocationHolder\", \"sPool\")\r\n              .alwaysExclude()\r\n        } else {\r\n          ref.add(excludedRefsBuilder)\r\n        }\r\n        (excludedRefsBuilder as ExcludedRefs.BuilderWithParams).named(ref.name)\r\n      }\r\n\r\n  LeakCanary.refWatcher(app)\r\n      .excludedRefs(excludedRefsBuilder.build())\r\n      .buildAndInstall()\r\n}\r\n```","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/square/leakcanary/issues/comments/471244917/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"AOrobator","id":4106884,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQxMDY4ODQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4106884?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AOrobator","html_url":"https://github.com/AOrobator","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AOrobator/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AOrobator/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AOrobator/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AOrobator/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AOrobator/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AOrobator/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AOrobator/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AOrobator/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AOrobator/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/square/leakcanary/issues/comments/471245049","html_url":"https://github.com/square/leakcanary/issues/1081#issuecomment-471245049","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/square/leakcanary/issues/1081","id":471245049,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ3MTI0NTA0OQ==","user":{"login":"AOrobator","id":4106884,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQxMDY4ODQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4106884?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AOrobator","html_url":"https://github.com/AOrobator","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AOrobator/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AOrobator/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AOrobator/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AOrobator/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AOrobator/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AOrobator/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AOrobator/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AOrobator/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AOrobator/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-03-10T04:02:23Z","updated_at":"2019-03-10T04:02:23Z","body":"@jrodbx Have you filed a feature request to move the relevant classes to the light greylist?
