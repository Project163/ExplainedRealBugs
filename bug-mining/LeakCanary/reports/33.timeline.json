No more cleanup on startup, and no hanging heap dump if the analysis crashes. We create a distinct \"pending\" hprof for each heap dump, and those are cleaned up as part of the hprof file rotation.\n- If a pending hprof hasn't been removed in 10 minutes, LeakCanary now assumes no analysis is in progress, and starts dumping the heap again.\n- We now use the app directory as a fallback if the external storage directory isn't available. This is transparent to the user.\n- If the external storage permission isn't granted, we show the notification as before but we also immediately fallback to the app directory, so that leak isn't lost.\n- Leak notifications now each use a distinct notification instead of erasing each other.\n- If LeakCanary can't perform a heap dump for any reason (e.g. analysis in progress, debugger attached ), it retries later with an exponential backoff.\n\nFixes #595.\nFixes #612.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/square/leakcanary/issues/628/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/square/leakcanary/issues/628/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":802830948,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50ODAyODMwOTQ4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/square/leakcanary/issues/events/802830948","actor":{"login":"pyricau","id":557033,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1NzAzMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/557033?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pyricau","html_url":"https://github.com/pyricau","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pyricau/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pyricau/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pyricau/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pyricau/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pyricau/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pyricau/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pyricau/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pyricau/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pyricau/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2016-09-26T19:49:24Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":908874784,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDkwODg3NDc4NA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/square/leakcanary/issues/events/908874784","actor":{"login":"Pengchengxiang","id":3655041,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2NTUwNDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3655041?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pengchengxiang","html_url":"https://github.com/Pengchengxiang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pengchengxiang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pengchengxiang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pengchengxiang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pengchengxiang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pengchengxiang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pengchengxiang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pengchengxiang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pengchengxiang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pengchengxiang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"d88aa5ecb3fb22b064f1e66699db2fbb9956286b","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/XLibrarys/leakcanary/commits/d88aa5ecb3fb22b064f1e66699db2fbb9956286b","created_at":"2017-01-02T09:36:18Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":909075811,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDkwOTA3NTgxMQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/square/leakcanary/issues/events/909075811","actor":{"login":"Pengchengxiang","id":3655041,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2NTUwNDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3655041?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pengchengxiang","html_url":"https://github.com/Pengchengxiang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pengchengxiang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pengchengxiang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pengchengxiang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pengchengxiang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pengchengxiang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pengchengxiang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pengchengxiang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pengchengxiang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pengchengxiang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"c0b4c2a0f7db0330790f29876b5a0e7e23ceeb4a","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/XLibrarys/leakcanary/commits/c0b4c2a0f7db0330790f29876b5a0e7e23ceeb4a","created_at":"2017-01-02T15:10:45Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
