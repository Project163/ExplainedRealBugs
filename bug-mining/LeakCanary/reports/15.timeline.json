We ignore the FrameDisplayEventReceiver message queue just so that the leak traces are less confusing, but the message queue is still held by the main thread looper anyway.\n\nWe can see that a destroyed activity (mDestroyed = true) holds on to a destroyed fragment. So the fragment is leaking because the activity is leaking.\n\nThe AppCompatEditText has a non null AttachInfo, so it hasn't been detached from the window which means its activity is not destroyed.\n\nThe key part here is:\n\n```\n* references android.support.v7.widget.AppCompatEditText.mClipboardExManager\n* references android.sec.clipboard.ClipboardExManager.mClipboardUIManager\n* references android.sec.clipboard.ClipboardUIManager.mContext\n* references .MainActivity.mFragments\n```\n\nIn other words, that Clipboard manager (which is some Samsung BS) is leaking a context. We already ignored ClipboardUIManager.sInstance: https://github.com/square/leakcanary/blob/master/leakcanary-android/src/main/java/com/squareup/leakcanary/AndroidExcludedRefs.java#L262\n\nI'm thinking we should change it to ignore `ClipboardUIManager.mContext` which will account for other things keeping references to the ClipboardUIManager.\n\nIt would be even better if someone extracted the ClipboardUIManager class from a samsung phone and decompiled it, so that we could see what's up and find a fix through reflection.\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/square/leakcanary/issues/comments/103949848/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"pyricau","id":557033,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1NzAzMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/557033?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pyricau","html_url":"https://github.com/pyricau","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pyricau/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pyricau/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pyricau/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pyricau/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pyricau/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pyricau/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pyricau/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pyricau/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pyricau/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":309714978,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MzA5NzE0OTc4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/square/leakcanary/issues/events/309714978","actor":{"login":"pepyakin","id":2205845,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyMDU4NDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2205845?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pepyakin","html_url":"https://github.com/pepyakin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pepyakin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pepyakin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pepyakin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pepyakin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pepyakin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pepyakin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pepyakin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pepyakin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pepyakin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2015-05-20T16:31:36Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":309714979,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDMwOTcxNDk3OQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/square/leakcanary/issues/events/309714979","actor":{"login":"pepyakin","id":2205845,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyMDU4NDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2205845?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pepyakin","html_url":"https://github.com/pepyakin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pepyakin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pepyakin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pepyakin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pepyakin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pepyakin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pepyakin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pepyakin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pepyakin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pepyakin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2015-05-20T16:31:36Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/square/leakcanary/issues/comments/103952569","html_url":"https://github.com/square/leakcanary/issues/133#issuecomment-103952569","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/square/leakcanary/issues/133","id":103952569,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEwMzk1MjU2OQ==","user":{"login":"pepyakin","id":2205845,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyMDU4NDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2205845?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pepyakin","html_url":"https://github.com/pepyakin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pepyakin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pepyakin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pepyakin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pepyakin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pepyakin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pepyakin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pepyakin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pepyakin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pepyakin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-05-20T16:37:55Z","updated_at":"2015-05-20T16:38:03Z","body":"@pyricau
