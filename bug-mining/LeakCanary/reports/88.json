This can be a bit surprising to developers who know they have a leak and wonder why LeakCanary is not triggering.\r\n\r\nLet's start notifying as soon as we have retained instance that is under the threshold. The notification will provide the current count of retained instances, and the foreground threshold (background is immediate). Tapping the notification will trigger LeakCanary immediately instead of waiting for the threshold, giving back control to developers.\r\n\r\nSomething like: \"3 retained instances (foreground threshold: 5). Tap to trigger heap dump\" (better wording suggestions welcome)\r\n\r\nThe notification will update when the count changes, and be dismissed when dumping the heap or when the count reaches 0.\r\n\r\nThanks @tyvsmith for the idea!\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"pyricau","id":557033,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1NzAzMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/557033?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pyricau","html_url":"https://github.com/pyricau","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pyricau/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pyricau/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pyricau/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pyricau/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pyricau/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pyricau/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pyricau/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pyricau/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pyricau/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/square/leakcanary/issues/1325/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/square/leakcanary/issues/1325/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
