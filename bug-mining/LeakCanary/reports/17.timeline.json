this is a problem (not huge, of course), personally I am fan of dynamic logs settings (and other debug configs), because when you look at the logs you just can't see useful info in this ocean of information: Retrofit loading something, GC cycle started/finished, db, Activities, Fragments and so on, so ability to choose what to log at runtime (in debug drawer) is great.\n\nIt'll be very cool to have some log proxy to redirect output to required source like a file/etc (useful for remote QA reports), but just regular dynamic log level will be okay
