They are repositories and similar objects.

When possible, this is the best way.\r\n\r\nBut there are some times that you end up with the hprof and an instance reference that you know that it should not be there and you don't know why. If this reference can not be detected automatically by Shark you re kind of lost. You have other options: use Android Studio and find the shortest path by hand looking at the depth. But there you are doing by hand something that Shark is really good at.
