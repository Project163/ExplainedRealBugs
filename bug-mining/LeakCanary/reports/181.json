Thank you for this.\r\n\r\n### Problem description\r\n\r\nI run instrumentation tests through command line and check results like this `adb logcat -s LeakCanary`. This nicely shows me heap analysis result. However, I'm not able to correlate this heap analysis with the corresponding test, as this does not include any test information.\r\n\r\n### Potential solutions\r\n\r\nIt would be useful if LeakCanary adds test name, say `<test case name>.<test method name>`, in the logcat so that `adb logcat -s LeakCanary` is enough to locate the tests and corresponding leak traces.\r\n\r\n### Additional information\r\n\r\nIt may also help to include test names for which leaks are not found, as it will help to check after which tests LeakCanary kicks in and which tests it skipped.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"pyricau","id":557033,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1NzAzMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/557033?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pyricau","html_url":"https://github.com/pyricau","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pyricau/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pyricau/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pyricau/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pyricau/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pyricau/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pyricau/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pyricau/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pyricau/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pyricau/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/square/leakcanary/issues/1883/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/square/leakcanary/issues/1883/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
