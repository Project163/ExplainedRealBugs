It made ProGuard a no-op for LeakCanary, which many people are ok with as a dev tool, and I'd rather have that than crashing on missing symbols. Someone wants the better config, they can contribute it and show me how to test proguarded builds.\r\n\r\nSince the heap dump parser was rewritten 100% of the code is in our control and I believe there's only one bit of reflection (in the next alpha, only on master) to retrieve `leakcanary.internal.InternalLeakCanary.INSTANCE` as a LeakSentryListener. Open to positive contributions that make that work and show me how to repro.","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/square/leakcanary/issues/comments/494089927/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"pyricau","id":557033,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1NzAzMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/557033?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pyricau","html_url":"https://github.com/pyricau","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pyricau/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pyricau/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pyricau/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pyricau/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pyricau/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pyricau/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pyricau/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pyricau/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pyricau/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/square/leakcanary/issues/comments/494124482","html_url":"https://github.com/square/leakcanary/issues/1354#issuecomment-494124482","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/square/leakcanary/issues/1354","id":494124482,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ5NDEyNDQ4Mg==","user":{"login":"Shipaaaa","id":11670840,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNjcwODQw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11670840?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Shipaaaa","html_url":"https://github.com/Shipaaaa","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Shipaaaa/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Shipaaaa/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Shipaaaa/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Shipaaaa/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Shipaaaa/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Shipaaaa/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Shipaaaa/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Shipaaaa/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Shipaaaa/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-05-20T19:44:14Z","updated_at":"2019-05-20T19:44:14Z","body":"> `it doesn't work` can mean many things :) .
