there any more info on this?  I'm attempting to use Leak Canary right now and although I've got four 'leaks' found, each one is for a Toast - and these are for activities that don't use Toasts.  I'm assuming Leak Canary is just reporting on itself here, which undermines its usefulness as a tool.\r\n\r\nAm I doing something wrong? \r\nIs there a way to stop Leak Canary attempting to show toasts? \r\nWhy is it showing toasts for activities that are destroyed? \r\nDoes it show toasts when the activity has leaked anyway, so are these activities actually leaking?\r\n<details>\r\n<summary>screenshots</summary>\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5053926/40845899-e6c42454-65af-11e8-8424-66cd3fe3ec5b.png)\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5053926/40845868-d661998e-65af-11e8-955f-9e8e6457ad76.png)\r\n</details>\r\n","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/square/leakcanary/issues/comments/393897490/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"Ninjars","id":5053926,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNTM5MjY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5053926?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ninjars","html_url":"https://github.com/Ninjars","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ninjars/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ninjars/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ninjars/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ninjars/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ninjars/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ninjars/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ninjars/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ninjars/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ninjars/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/square/leakcanary/issues/comments/397499253","html_url":"https://github.com/square/leakcanary/issues/844#issuecomment-397499253","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/square/leakcanary/issues/844","id":397499253,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM5NzQ5OTI1Mw==","user":{"login":"pyricau","id":557033,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1NzAzMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/557033?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pyricau","html_url":"https://github.com/pyricau","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pyricau/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pyricau/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pyricau/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pyricau/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pyricau/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pyricau/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pyricau/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pyricau/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pyricau/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-06-15T03:00:37Z","updated_at":"2018-06-15T03:00:37Z","body":"2 issues here:\r\n\r\n1) Toasts can apparently crash on API 25.

want to preface this by saying that I don't know if this leak is an actual issue, as it seems that the problem is resolving by itself after a while. If I dump the heap later on, I don't see the ReportFragment object that LeakCanary is mentioning (or multiple Activities).\r\n\r\nStill, the documentation of LeakCanary doesn't seem to be saying what I should do about this problem. Should I somehow add this to the excluded list—but then, how do I add the “No leak found” there? Or perhaps I am supposed to live with this, ignoring the notifications?\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nThe leak happens when tapping a popup menu item that calls `recreate()`:\r\n\r\n```\r\nIn lv.s.reportfragmentleak:1.0:1.\r\n* androidx.lifecycle.ReportFragment has leaked:\r\n* RenderNodeAnimator.mTarget\r\n* ↳ RenderNode.mOwningView\r\n* ↳ MenuPopupWindow$MenuDropDownListView.!(mHoverListener)!\r\n* ↳ MenuPopupWindow.!(mPopup)!\r\n* ↳ AppCompatPopupWindow.!(mExitTransition)!\r\n* ↳ Fade.!(mCurrentAnimators)!\r\n* ↳ ArrayList.!(elementData)!\r\n* ↳ array Object[].!([0])!\r\n* ↳ ObjectAnimator.!(mListeners)!\r\n* ↳ ArrayList.!(elementData)!\r\n* ↳ array Object[].!([2])!\r\n* ↳ Transition$2.!(this$0)!

Both the fab and the menu `recreate()` the activity, tapping on the fab works fine but tapping on the menu item leads to the leak. Interestingly, if you look at the provided heap, it contains 11 MainActivity instances, but LeakCanary doesn't complain about those.\r\n\r\nI was unable to replicate the issue on other devices/Android versions; on every system tapping on the menu reliably triggers LeakCanary, but on android 7.1.2 and P (emulated) this always leads to the “No leak found” notification. This might be explained by the fact that both of these devices are *much* slower than my main device running Android One 8.1.0. \r\n\r\n(Also I'm getting this chrash on 7.1.2, which looks exactly like #844:\r\n\r\n```\r\n2018-10-28 00:29:52.720 8317-8317/lv.s.reportfragmentleak E/AndroidRuntime: FATAL EXCEPTION: main\r\n    Process: lv.s.reportfragmentleak, PID: 8317\r\n    android.view.WindowManager$BadTokenException: Unable to add window -- token android.os.BinderProxy@775c69b is not valid; is your activity running?\r\n        at android.view.ViewRootImpl.setView(ViewRootImpl.java:679)\r\n        at android.view.WindowManagerGlobal.addView(WindowManagerGlobal.java:342)\r\n        at android.view.WindowManagerImpl.addView(WindowManagerImpl.java:94)\r\n        at android.widget.Toast$TN.handleShow(Toast.java:459)\r\n        at android.widget.Toast$TN$2.handleMessage(Toast.java:342)\r\n        at android.os.Handler.dispatchMessage(Handler.java:102)\r\n        at android.os.Looper.loop(Looper.java:154)\r\n        at android.app.ActivityThread.main(ActivityThread.java:6186)\r\n        at java.lang.reflect.Method.invoke(Native Method)\r\n        at com.android.internal.os.ZygoteInit$MethodAndArgsCaller.run(ZygoteInit.java:889)\r\n        at com.android.internal.os.ZygoteInit.main(ZygoteInit.java:779)\r\n```\r\n\r\n...which might be related to a very similar leak that mentions a Toast in my actual application:\r\n\r\n```\r\nIn com.ubergeek42.WeechatAndroid.debug:0.13-debug:437.\r\n* androidx.lifecycle.ReportFragment has leaked:\r\n* Toast$TN.mNextView\r\n* ↳ LinearLayout.mParent\r\n* ↳ ViewRootImpl.!(mChoreographer)!\r\n* ↳ Choreographer.!(mCallbackQueues)!\r\n* ↳ array Choreographer$CallbackQueue[].!([1])!\r\n* ↳ Choreographer$CallbackQueue.!(mHead)!\r\n* ↳ Choreographer$CallbackRecord.!(action)!\r\n* ↳ AnimationHandler$1.!(this$0)!
