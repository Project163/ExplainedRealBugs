upgrading to 1.5.2 I started to get a crash which from the stracktrace I can only guess is produced by LeakCanary. \r\nThe issue happens randomly under the next scenario:\r\n1)\tI open the app which uses LeakCanary, and leaving the app open I turn off the display. As a note the device has the screen security lock setting enabled.\r\n2)\tAfter a few seconds, up to a minute, the logcat shows (not always) the below stacktrace. and when I unlock the screen the app is already crashed.\r\n\r\nIn the stacktrace I can see is produced by android.widget.Toast, and as my app doesn’t use Toasts at all, I only guess that there was a memory leak while the screen is off, and the toast is the warning one from LeakCanary.\r\n\r\n```\r\nThread: main\r\n  android.view.WindowManager$BadTokenException: Unable to add window -- token android.os.BinderProxy@9441757 is not valid; is your activity running?\r\n\t  at android.view.ViewRootImpl.setView(ViewRootImpl.java:679)\r\n\t  at android.view.WindowManagerGlobal.addView(WindowManagerGlobal.java:342)\r\n\t  at android.view.WindowManagerImpl.addView(WindowManagerImpl.java:93)\r\n\t  at android.widget.Toast$TN.handleShow(Toast.java:459)\r\n\t  at android.widget.Toast$TN$2.handleMessage(Toast.java:342)\r\n\t  at android.os.Handler.dispatchMessage(Handler.java:102)\r\n\t  at android.os.Looper.loop(Looper.java:154)\r\n\t  at android.app.ActivityThread.main(ActivityThread.java:6121)\r\n\t  at java.lang.reflect.Method.invoke(Native Method)\r\n\t  at com.android.internal.os.ZygoteInit$MethodAndArgsCaller.run(ZygoteInit.java:889)\r\n\t  at com.android.internal.os.ZygoteInit.main(ZygoteInit.java:779)\r\n```\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"pyricau","id":557033,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1NzAzMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/557033?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pyricau","html_url":"https://github.com/pyricau","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pyricau/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pyricau/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pyricau/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pyricau/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pyricau/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pyricau/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pyricau/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pyricau/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pyricau/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/square/leakcanary/issues/844/reactions","total_count":14,"+1":14,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/square/leakcanary/issues/844/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
