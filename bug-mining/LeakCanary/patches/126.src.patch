 ## Configuration
 
+LeakCanary has a default configuration that should work well for most apps. You can also customize it to your needs. The LeakCanary configuration is held by two singleton objects (`AppWatcher` and `LeakCanary`) and can be updated at any time. Most developers configure LeakCanary in their **debug** [Application](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/Application) class:
+
+```kotlin
+class DebugExampleApplication : ExampleApplication() {
+
+  override fun onCreate() {
+    super.onCreate()
+    AppWatcher.config = AppWatcher.config.copy(watchFragmentViews = false)
+  }
+}
+```
+
+
+!!! info
+    You can create a debug application class in your `src/debug/java` folder. Don't forget to also register it in `src/debug/AndroidManifest.xml`.
+
 To customize the detection of retained objects at runtime, update [AppWatcher.config](/leakcanary/api/leakcanary-object-watcher-android/leakcanary/-app-watcher/config/):
