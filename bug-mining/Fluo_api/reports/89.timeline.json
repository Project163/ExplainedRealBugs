responding to your email for more info here on the issue.  I am not sure exactly what needs to be done, but I will try to explain what I think needs to be done.  I may be wrong about some things.\n\nSome quick background.  The [Fluo project pom](https://github.com/fluo-io/resources/blob/613cf66b7894e9f376b6263a4a6ced8326e3e8dc/pom.xml) provides common functionality across Fluo project poms ([Fluo pom](https://github.com/apache/incubator-fluo/blob/fee0ca74d04aad8d0dc599817ac5deca19f92c44/pom.xml) and [Recipes pom](https://github.com/apache/incubator-fluo-recipes/blob/93f482aa447e5f63c3e3406f05e328404ac143ba/pom.xml)).  For example the Fluo parent pom sets up code formatting, findbugs, etc.  Therefore each project pom does not have to duplicate all of this.  The projects poms [used to duplicate](https://github.com/apache/incubator-fluo/commit/2911b373357ee87c99e019475f3ade13c499205b#diff-600376dffeb79835ede4a0b285078036) all of this before creating the Fluo project pom.\n\nNow that we are moving to Apache we want to use config from the [Apache pom](https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/org/apache/apache/18/apache-18.pom) to do releases.   We also want to keep things from the  [Fluo Project pom](https://github.com/fluo-io/resources/blob/613cf66b7894e9f376b6263a4a6ced8326e3e8dc/pom.xml) like code formatting.  To accomplish this we can add the Apache as a parent of the Fluo project pom.\n\nAlso we need to remove the current info about releasing to Sonatype (where io.flou releases were done) from any of the poms where it may occur.\n\nThe following is the high level overview of what I think needs to be done.\n1. Add [Apache pom](https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/org/apache/apache/18/apache-18.pom) as parent of [Fluo project pom](https://github.com/fluo-io/resources/blob/613cf66b7894e9f376b6263a4a6ced8326e3e8dc/pom.xml)\n2. Reconcile plugin config that occur in both poms.  Feel free to ask about reconciling any duplicate plugins with different config.\n3. Remove Sonatype distribution management section from Fluo project pom.  Look for other Sonatye stuff to remove. (should inherit distribution management from Apache parent pom)\n4. Release new version of Fluo project pom\n5. Update [Fluo pom](https://github.com/apache/incubator-fluo/blob/fee0ca74d04aad8d0dc599817ac5deca19f92c44/pom.xml) and [Recipes pom](https://github.com/apache/incubator-fluo-recipes/blob/93f482aa447e5f63c3e3406f05e328404ac143ba/pom.xml) to use new version of Fluo project pom.\n\nWe were planning on releasing the Fluo project pom to Sonatype because we have not transitioned that project to Apache yet.   @ctubbsii  how can the Fluo project pom release to Sonatype if it drops Sonatype distribution management and inherits Apache distribution management?\n","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo-fluo/issues/comments/229363678/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"keith-turner","id":1268739,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNjg3Mzk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1268739?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner","html_url":"https://github.com/keith-turner","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":707791199,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50NzA3NzkxMTk5","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo-fluo/issues/events/707791199","actor":{"login":"Garvit244","id":6849301,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4NDkzMDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6849301?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Garvit244","html_url":"https://github.com/Garvit244","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Garvit244/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Garvit244/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Garvit244/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Garvit244/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Garvit244/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Garvit244/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Garvit244/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Garvit244/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Garvit244/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2016-06-29T13:57:34Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":707791200,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDcwNzc5MTIwMA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo-fluo/issues/events/707791200","actor":{"login":"Garvit244","id":6849301,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4NDkzMDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6849301?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Garvit244","html_url":"https://github.com/Garvit244","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Garvit244/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Garvit244/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Garvit244/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Garvit244/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Garvit244/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Garvit244/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Garvit244/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Garvit244/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Garvit244/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2016-06-29T13:57:34Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":707791202,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50NzA3NzkxMjAy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo-fluo/issues/events/707791202","actor":{"login":"ctubbsii","id":1280725,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyODA3MjU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1280725?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii","html_url":"https://github.com/ctubbsii","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2016-06-29T13:57:35Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":707791203,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZW

pom.\n","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo-fluo/issues/comments/229368588/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"keith-turner","id":1268739,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNjg3Mzk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1268739?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner","html_url":"https://github.com/keith-turner","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":707814186,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50NzA3ODE0MTg2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo-fluo/issues/events/707814186","actor":{"login":"ctubbsii","id":1280725,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyODA3MjU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1280725?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii","html_url":"https://github.com/ctubbsii","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2016-06-29T14:13:39Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":707814187,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDcwNzgxNDE4Nw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo-fluo/issues/events/707814187","actor":{"login":"ctubbsii","id":1280725,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyODA3MjU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1280725?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii","html_url":"https://github.com/ctubbsii","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2016-06-29T14:13:39Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo-fluo/issues/comments/229402893","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/accumulo-fluo/issues/688#issuecomment-229402893","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo-fluo/issues/688","id":229402893,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIyOTQwMjg5Mw==","user":{"login":"Garvit244","id":6849301,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4NDkzMDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6849301?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Garvit244","html_url":"https://github.com/Garvit244","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Garvit244/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Garvit244/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Garvit244/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Garvit244/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Garvit244/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Garvit244/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Garvit244/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Garvit244/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Garvit244/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-06-29T

plugins.\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo-fluo/issues/comments/229731035/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"ctubbsii","id":1280725,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyODA3MjU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1280725?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii","html_url":"https://github.com/ctubbsii","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":709487742,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50NzA5NDg3NzQy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo-fluo/issues/events/709487742","actor":{"login":"Garvit244","id":6849301,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4NDkzMDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6849301?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Garvit244","html_url":"https://github.com/Garvit244","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Garvit244/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Garvit244/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Garvit244/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Garvit244/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Garvit244/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Garvit244/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Garvit244/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Garvit244/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Garvit244/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2016-06-30T17:31:03Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":709487744,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDcwOTQ4Nzc0NA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo-fluo/issues/events/709487744","actor":{"login":"Garvit244","id":6849301,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4NDkzMDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6849301?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Garvit244","html_url":"https://github.com/Garvit244","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Garvit244/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Garvit244/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Garvit244/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Garvit244/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Garvit244/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Garvit244/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Garvit244/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Garvit244/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Garvit244/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2016-06-30T17:31:03Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo-fluo/issues/comments/229733134","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/accumulo-fluo/issues/688#issuecomment-229733134","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo-fluo/issues/688","id":229733134,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIyOTczMzEzNA==","user":{"login":"ctubbsii","id":1280725,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyODA3MjU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1280725?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii","html_url":"https://github.com/ctubbsii","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-06-30T17:38:49Z","updated_at":"2016-06-30T1
