percolator paper mentioned that read locks were not implemented because they were usually uneeded and expensive.  I agree with this, in most situations you do want to read data without a read lock.  However I do find that sometimes I would like a read lock.  For example consider a use case with graph type data.  An edge is added to Fluo and joined with information from the two nodes it connects.  I want multiple edge operations to be able to proceed concurrently, as long as the node information does not change.  Conceptually,  I would like an edge operation to get a read lock on the two nodes its interacting with. If multiple edge operations concurrently get a read lock on the same node, none of them will collide.  However a node operation that got a write lock on the node would cause collisions.\r\n\r\nFrom an API perspective, one possible way to implement this is adding the following  :\r\n\r\n```java\r\npublic interface TransactionBase {\r\n  //return snapshot where reads acquire a read lock\r\n  SnapshotBase withReadLock();\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis would enable writing code like the following :\r\n\r\n```java\r\ntry(Transaction tx = fluoClient.newTransaction()) {\r\n  //read w/o read lock\r\n  Bytes val1 = tx.get(row1, col1);\r\n  \r\n  //read data with read lock\r\n  Bytes val2 = tx.withReadLock().get(row2, col2);\r\n    .\r\n    .\r\n    .\r\n  tx.commit(); //will collide if row2+col2 was written OR may cause a concurrent write to row2+col2 to fail\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"keith-turner","id":1268739,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNjg3Mzk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1268739?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner","html_url":"https://github.com/keith-turner","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo-fluo/issues/917/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo-fluo/issues/917/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
