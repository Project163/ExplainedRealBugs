In these frameworks, calling commit() and close() on the transaction is not done by the user and is instead handled by the framework.  \n\nThere may be use cases where users want to create transactions outside the Loader or Observer frameworks.  For these situations, a newTransaction() method could be added to FluoClient.  This method will need to create Transaction object that has close() & commit() methods.  \n\nBelow is a possible interface for these transactions:\n\n``` java\ninterface CloseableTransaction extends Closeable,Transaction //also has a commit() method\n```\n","closed_by":{"login":"mikewalch","id":730698,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjczMDY5OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/730698?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikewalch","html_url":"https://github.com/mikewalch","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikewalch/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikewalch/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikewalch/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikewalch/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikewalch/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikewalch/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikewalch/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikewalch/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikewalch/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo-fluo/issues/175/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo-fluo/issues/175/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
