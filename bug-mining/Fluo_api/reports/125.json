To accomplish this I think the following methods should be added to [ScannerBuilder](https://github.com/apache/fluo/blob/rel/fluo-1.1.0-incubating/modules/api/src/main/java/org/apache/fluo/api/client/scanner/ScannerBuilder.java).  The implementations of these methods should call the existing static methods in [Span](https://github.com/apache/fluo/blob/rel/fluo-1.1.0-incubating/modules/api/src/main/java/org/apache/fluo/api/data/Span.java).\r\n\r\n```java\r\ninterface ScannerBuilder {\r\n  //implementations of following should call corresponding Span.exact() methods\r\n  default ScannerBuilder over(Bytes row) {over(Span.exact(row));}\r\n  default ScannerBuilder over(CharSequence row) {...}\r\n  default ScannerBuilder over(Bytes row, Column col){...}\r\n  default ScannerBuilder over(CharSequence row, , Column col){...}\r\n\r\n  //implementations of following should call corresponding Span.prefix() methods\r\n  default ScannerBuilder overPrefix(Bytes row) {over(Span.prefix(row));}\r\n  default ScannerBuilder overPrefix(CharSequence row){...}\r\n  default ScannerBuilder overPrefix(Bytes row, Column col){...}\r\n  default ScannerBuilder overPrefix(CharSequence row, , Column col){...}\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe java docs for the new methods should have a `@since` tag and link to the javadoc in the corresponding Span methods.\r\n\r\nAll existing test should be updated to use the new methods.  For example [ScannerIT](https://github.com/apache/fluo/blob/rel/fluo-1.1.0-incubating/modules/integration/src/test/java/org/apache/fluo/integration/impl/ScannerIT.java), FluoIT, WorkerIT, and WeakNotificationIT should be updated to use the new methods.\r\n\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"keith-turner","id":1268739,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNjg3Mzk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1268739?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner","html_url":"https://github.com/keith-turner","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo-fluo/issues/923/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo-fluo/issues/923/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
