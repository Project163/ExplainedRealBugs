byte[] ByteArrayUtil.concat(Bytes ... listOfBytes)` has the following performance problems\r\n\r\n * It uses ByteArrayOutputStream() which has synchronized public methods.  This only used by a single thread and in the past I have observed this unnecessary synchronization can have significant consequences.\r\n * It takes var args, however the most frequent use of it passes two arguments.  This results in the allocation of a `new Bytes[2]` which could easily be avoided with a  two argument version of the method.\r\n\r\nOptimizing this could possible use `copyTo()` from #827 and directly creating a byte array.  The only tricky part is the `writeVInt()` method.  One possible workaround would be to not use `writeVInt()` when the length is less than or equal to 127.
