The current options for that are to call Bytes.toArray() or use the Bytes.byteAt() method.  If Bytes had a `copyTo(byte[] dest, int offset)`   method then it could support this use case more efficiently.  The following is an example.\r\n\r\n```java\r\nBytes field1 = Bytes.of(\"foo\");\r\nBytes field2 = Bytes.of(\"bar\");\r\n\r\nbyte[] dest = new byte[field1.length() + field2.lenght() + 1];\r\n\r\nfield1.copyTo(dest, 0);\r\ndest[field1.lenght()] = ':';\r\nfield2.copyTo(dest, field1.lenght()+1);\r\n```\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"keith-turner","id":1268739,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNjg3Mzk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1268739?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner","html_url":"https://github.com/keith-turner","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo-fluo/issues/827/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo-fluo/issues/827/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
