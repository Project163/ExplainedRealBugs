The existing classes that help users programattically build a properties object do not align with these two methods.   When I thought about writing the documentation that would describe how a user would use the existing properties helper classes with the new FluoFactory methods, I knew it was a train wreck.\n\nOne solution is to create one helper class.  Another solution is to create a helper per FluoFactory method.\n","closed_by":{"login":"mikewalch","id":730698,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjczMDY5OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/730698?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikewalch","html_url":"https://github.com/mikewalch","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikewalch/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikewalch/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikewalch/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikewalch/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikewalch/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikewalch/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikewalch/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikewalch/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikewalch/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo-fluo/issues/121/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo-fluo/issues/121/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
