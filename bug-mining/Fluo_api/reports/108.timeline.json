If a caching feature is introduced, the user should have control over the size and lifecycle of the cache, to learn from Accumulo's lessons.\n\nOf the options, I think the short-lived cache is most appealing. But, if it's user-provided, they could selectively re-use the same cache for many operations.\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo-fluo/issues/comments/260815430/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"ctubbsii","id":1280725,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyODA3MjU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1280725?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii","html_url":"https://github.com/ctubbsii","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ctubbsii/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":863282757,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDg2MzI4Mjc1Nw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo-fluo/issues/events/863282757","actor":{"login":"keith-turner","id":1268739,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNjg3Mzk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1268739?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner","html_url":"https://github.com/keith-turner","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"c5efed75775d6cea6680e93b02dfef534301c5cc","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/keith-turner/fluo/commits/c5efed75775d6cea6680e93b02dfef534301c5cc","created_at":"2016-11-17T18:49:46Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":863364813,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDg2MzM2NDgxMw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo-fluo/issues/events/863364813","actor":{"login":"keith-turner","id":1268739,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNjg3Mzk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1268739?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner","html_url":"https://github.com/keith-turner","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"c896fc16bb6ab0af4df9e26554516a70c1ffa302","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/keith-turner/fluo/commits/c896fc16bb6ab0af4df9e26554516a70c1ffa302","created_at":"2016-11-17T19:45:49Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo-fluo/issues/comments/261365908","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/accumulo-fluo/issues/800#issuecomment-261365908","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo-fluo/issues/800","id":261365908,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2MTM2NTkwOA==","user":{"login":"keith-turner","id":1268739,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNjg3Mzk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1268739?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner","html_url":"https://github.com/keith-turner","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/subscriptions","organizations_url"
