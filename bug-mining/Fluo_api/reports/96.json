Reading and writing byte arrays to input and output streams is a common operation, would like to support this functionality with Bytes.\n- Improve Interoperability with ByteBuffer.  Returning a read only ByteBuffer backed by a Bytes internal array would be easy to do and will allow the many useful operations of ByteBuffer to be efficiently leveraged.\n- Document why Bytes exists in its javadoc instead of using ByteBuffer\n- Remove the concat and split methods.  The methods are specialized encodings of multiple Bytes.  With the primitives above, someone should be able to easily encode bytes however they like.\n- Remove the methods that take DataInput and DataOutput (prefering interop with InputStream and OutputStream).\n- Remove vint interface.  This will allow data test to move to API package.\n","closed_by":{"login":"asfgit","id":1341245,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNDEyNDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1341245?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfgit","html_url":"https://github.com/asfgit","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfgit/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfgit/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfgit/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfgit/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfgit/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfgit/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfgit/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfgit/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfgit/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo-fluo/issues/746/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo-fluo/issues/746/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
