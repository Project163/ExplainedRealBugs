This would allow transactions to get a callback when a commit completes.  This offer similar functionality as adding a post commit callback to the loader interface.

The problem this issue is trying to solve is getting good throughput from a source of continuous information that needs feedback on when that information was successfully processed by Fluo.  The LoaderExecutor gives good throughput for committing transactions, but lacks the feedback mechanism.\n\nI was thinking about how to solve  this w/ the current 1.0.0 release.  One way would be to process batches with the loader executor.  For example process 10,000 transactions with the LoaderExecutor and then shut the LoaderExecutor down.  After its shut down, then feedback can be given to the information source that all 10,000 transactions completed.\n","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo-fluo/issues/comments/257617340/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"keith-turner","id":1268739,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNjg3Mzk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1268739?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner","html_url":"https://github.com/keith-turner","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"actor":{"login":"keith-turner","id":1268739,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNjg3Mzk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1268739?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner","html_url":"https://github.com/keith-turner","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-11-27T19:56:45Z","updated_at":"2017-11-27T19:56:45Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo-fluo/issues/969","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo-fluo","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo-fluo/issues/969/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo-fluo/issues/969/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo-fluo/issues/969/events","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/accumulo-fluo/pull/969","id":273670957,"node_id":"MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0MTUyNDE1Mzc1","number":969,"title":"Issue-967","user":{"login":"jkosh44","id":10800303,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwODAwMzAz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10800303?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkosh44","html_url":"https://github.com/jkosh44","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkosh44/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkosh44/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkosh44/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkosh44/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkosh44/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkosh44/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkosh44/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkosh44/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkosh44/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo-fluo/milestones/8","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/accumulo-fluo/milestone/8","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo-fluo/milestones/8/labels","id":3174413,"node_id":"MDk6TWlsZXN0b25lMzE3NDQxMw==","number":8,"title":"2.0.0","description":"","creator":{"login":"keith-turner","id":1268739,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNjg3Mzk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1268739?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner","html_url":"https://github.com/keith-turner","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keith-turner/orgs","repos_url":

#795 a `submit()` method was added to the `LoaderExecutor` that returned a `CompletableFuture<Void>` so a client could be aware of when the transaction committed.
