Application config use the SimpleConfiguration interface.  Per observer configuration uses a `Map<String, String>` and calls the config parameters instead of configuration.\n\nThese APIs evolved like this over time.  Writing the documentation made me notice the divergent paths.  If both of these APIs had been designed at the same time, it likely would have been more consistent.\n\nI think it would be nice if per observer config used SimpleConfiguration.  Wondering if this should be made consistent before 1.0.0 or left as-is and made consistent later by adding new methods.\n","closed_by":{"login":"asfgit","id":1341245,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNDEyNDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1341245?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfgit","html_url":"https://github.com/asfgit","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfgit/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfgit/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfgit/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfgit/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfgit/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfgit/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfgit/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfgit/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfgit/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo-fluo/issues/768/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo-fluo/issues/768/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
