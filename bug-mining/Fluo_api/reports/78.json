Maybe something like the following :\n\n``` java\n    FluoConfiguration conf = ...;\n    Oracle oracle = FluoFactory.newOracle(conf);\n    oracle.start();\n    //wait for signal to shutdown\n    oracle.stop();\n```\n\nWorker is too generic... thinking NotificationProcessor may be a better name to use in the API.\n\n``` java\n   FluoConfiguration conf = ...;\n   NotificationProcessor ntfyProc = FluoFactory.newNotificationProcessor(conf);\n   ntfyProc.start();\n   //wait for signal to shutdown\n   ntfyProc.stop();\n```\n\nCould possibly implement [Guava Service](http://google.github.io/guava/releases/snapshot/api/docs/com/google/common/util/concurrent/Service.html)\n","closed_by":{"login":"asfgit","id":1341245,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNDEyNDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1341245?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfgit","html_url":"https://github.com/asfgit","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfgit/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfgit/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfgit/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfgit/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfgit/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfgit/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfgit/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfgit/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asfgit/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo-fluo/issues/647/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/accumulo-fluo/issues/647/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
