have a repo where if I run `yarn prettier -c foo.json` it formats it one way, and when I save it in emacs with this `prettier-mode` enabled, it formats it another way - and I can't figure out for the life of me why.\r\n\r\nI do appreciate that the `prettier` executable run via `yarn` is different to the base64-encoded one which comes with `prettier.el` (or at least it does in my case, when obtaining it from MELPA via [`straight.el`](https://github.com/raxod502/straight.el/), so maybe the difference is related to that, e.g. different prettier versions with different defaults?  Or maybe they are somehow picking up different configurations?  Although the latter seems unlikely since I only have one `.prettierrc.yml` at the top of the repository in question.\r\n\r\nI've looked at the source to see if there's any way to find out the prettier config which the `prettier.el` long-running process is using, but there's nothing obvious.  I'm not even sure whether `prettier.el` can simultaneously support multiple different configurations if your emacs has files from different projects open at once, each with different `.prettierrc` settings?\r\n\r\n## Describe the solution you'd like\r\n\r\n- A `M-x` command to show a) the prettier config *just for the current file*, and b) how that config was obtained.  (I'm aware of `M-x prettier-info`, but that is a giant dump of the entire config which is so big, I have no idea where to start looking within that to see how the active options compare with the contents of the corresponding `.prettierrc.yml`.\r\n- Some useful info in the `*prettier (local)*` buffer (or in a separate buffer; I don't mind which), explaining the interactions with the server as they happen.  That buffer remains entirely empty for me, which isn't very useful.\r\n\r\n## Describe alternatives you've considered\r\n\r\nI instrumented `prettier--sync-config` and `prettier--load-config` with Edebug and stepped through them, but that just showed me some hugely complex data structure returned from the server, so it wasn't any use.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jscheid/prettier.el/issues/92/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jscheid/prettier.el/issues/92/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/prettier/prettier/issues/comments/922687594","html_url":"https://github.com/prettier/prettier/issues/11553#issuecomment-922687594","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/prettier/prettier/issues/11553","id":922687594,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBHn_e842_xhq","user":{"login":"KonradHoeffner","id":839577,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgzOTU3Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/839577?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/KonradHoeffner","html_url":"https://github.com/KonradHoeffner","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KonradHoeffner/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KonradHoeffner/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KonradHoeffner/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KonradHoeffner/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KonradHoeffner/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KonradHoeffner/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KonradHoeffner/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KonradHoeffner/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KonradHoeffner/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-09-20T07:18:50Z","updated_at":"2021-09-20T07:19:20Z","body":"@fisker:

Prettier treats files like `package.json` in a special way that makes it compatible with the way NPM modifies files. The only rules that are really followed by default are those involving indentation, which are [respected by NPM](https://github.com/npm/cli/blob/4e81a6a4106e4e125b0eefda042b75cfae0a5f23/workspaces/libnpmversion/lib/write-json.js).\r\n\r\nThis also allows plugins like [`prettier-plugin-pkg`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/prettier-plugin-pkg) to add *additional* rules such as ordering. The ordering changes introduced there are *also* preserved by NPM, see [documentation for `JSON.stringify()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/JSON/stringify):\r\n\r\n> Properties are visited using the same algorithm as [`Object.keys()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/keys), which has a well-defined order and is stable across implementations. For example, `JSON.stringify` on the same object will always produce the same string, and `JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(obj))` would produce an object with the same key ordering as the original (assuming the object is completely JSON-serializable).\r\n\r\nSo `package.json` (and similar files like `composer.json`) don't need to be ignored at all and unless there are manual modifications being made to the file(s), Prettier shouldn't ever be finding violations for it to be a nuisance.","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/prettier/prettier/issues/comments/2282225003/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"Kenneth-Sills","id":132029135,"node_id":"U_kgDOB96azw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/132029135?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kenneth-Sills","html_url":"https://github.com/Kenneth-Sills","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kenneth-Sills/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kenneth-Sills/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kenneth-Sills/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kenneth-Sills/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kenneth-Sills/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kenneth-Sills/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kenneth-Sills/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kenneth-Sills/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kenneth-Sills/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}}]
