Please answer the following.

Is this something that should be supported in core? It seems there’s a [bunch of checks for non-standard configurations](https://github.com/stylelint/stylelint/blob/master/lib/rules/string-quotes/index.js) so I don’t know if that relates to Sass modules.\r\n\r\nI’ve already submitted it to [stylelint-scss](https://github.com/kristerkari/stylelint-scss/issues/508), but author consesus is that it should be handled in core.\r\n\r\n> What solution would you like to see?\r\n\r\nIs it possible to add certain at-rules to allowed list of rules which should follow definition for this rule?\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nBefore posting, please check that the feature hasn't already been:\r\n-  added in the next release (https://github.com/stylelint/stylelint/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md)\r\n-  discussed previously (https://github.com/stylelint/stylelint/search)\r\n\r\nYou can help us add the feature more quickly by:\r\n1.
