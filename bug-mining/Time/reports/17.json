Shorter numbers are zero-padded to this amount.\".\n\nHowever, `S` doesn't adhere to this description, for example:\n\n```\nDateTimeFormatter format = DateTimeFormat.forPattern(\"S\")\nformat.parseDateTime(\"1\") # All is well\nformat.parseDateTime(\"12\") # IllegalArgumentException: Invalid format\n```\n\n`S` actually represents the exact number of digits, not the minimum.\n\nI suggest adding a new `presentation` to the documentation in `DateTimeFormat` with a description that matches the behaviour of `S`.  I think this is the right behaviour for `S`, and the documentation just needs updating but I thought I should double check before raising a pull request. If it's the expected behaviour I'll submit a PR with a change to the docs :)\n","closed_by":{"login":"jodastephen","id":213212,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMzIxMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/213212?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jodastephen","html_url":"https://github.com/jodastephen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jodastephen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jodastephen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jodastephen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jodastephen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jodastephen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jodastephen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jodastephen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jodastephen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jodastephen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/JodaOrg/joda-time/issues/62/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/JodaOrg/joda-time/issues/62/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
