I think this is happening because of the `position++` in the `DateTimeFormatterBuilder` class. I have forked the repo and tried to fix it with this commit: https://github.com/hshankar/joda-time/commit/4d7255901c897a8573e1a75c9e6927103de20ba2\n\nIf you think that is the right approach to fix this, I would love to submit this fix as a pull request. I have verified that all existing test cases pass successfully after this fix. Let me know if I should add any test cases. I have a small test class which I have used to test the fix:\n\n```\npublic class Test {\n\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        test(1, \"yyyyMMdd\", \"+20130101\");\n        test(2, \"MMyyyydd\", \"01+201301\");\n        test(3, \"MM-yyyy-dd\", \"01-+2013-01\");\n        test(4, \"yyyydd\", \"+201321\");\n    }\n\n    private static void test(int caseNo, String format, String input) {\n        System.out.println((caseNo + \". \" + \"(\" + format + \", \" + input + \") => \" + DateTimeFormat\n                .forPattern(format).parseDateTime(input)));\n    }\n}\n```\n\nHere are the outputs:\nBefore the fix:\n\n```\n1. (yyyyMMdd, +20130101) => 20130-10-01T00:00:00.000+05:30\n2. (MMyyyydd, 01+2013010) => 20130-01-10T00:00:00.000+05:30\n3. (MM-yyyy-dd, 01-+2013-01) => 2013-01-01T00:00:00.000+05:30\n4. (yyyydd, +201321) => 20132-01-01T00:00:00.000+05:30\n```\n\nAfter the fix:\n\n```\n1. (yyyyMMdd, +20130101) => 2013-01-01T00:00:00.000+05:30\n2. (MMyyyydd, 01+201301) => 2013-01-01T00:00:00.000+05:30\n3. (MM-yyyy-dd, 01-+2013-01) => 2013-01-01T00:00:00.000+05:30\n4. (yyyydd, +201321) => 2013-01-21T00:00:00.000+05:30\n```\n\nI can add these tests to the proper test class if you can point me to the right place to add them!\n","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/JodaOrg/joda-time/issues/comments/28392023/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"hshankar","id":415309,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQxNTMwOQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/415309?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hshankar","html_url":"https://github.com/hshankar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hshankar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hshankar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hshankar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hshankar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hshankar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hshankar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hshankar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hshankar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hshankar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/JodaOrg/joda-time/issues/comments/28680064","html_url":"https://github.com/JodaOrg/joda-time/issues/86#issuecomment-28680064","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/JodaOrg/joda-time/issues/86","id":28680064,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI4NjgwMDY0","user":{"login":"leadVisionary","id":640496,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0MDQ5Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/640496?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/leadVisionary","html_url":"https://github.com/leadVisionary","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leadVisionary/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leadVisionary/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leadVisionary/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leadVisionary/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leadVisionary/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leadVisionary/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leadVisionary/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leadVisionary/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leadVisionary/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2013-11-18T07:49:17Z","updated_at":"2013-11-18T07:49:53Z","body":"You should probably add tests as JUnit test cases in https://github.com/JodaOrg/joda-time/blob/master/src/test/java/org/joda/time/format/TestDateTimeFormatterBuilder.java\n\nYou should add four test methods for each of these cases.\n\nIt would appear your approach is to detect the presence of a \"+\" and skip it.

If we say that `+2013` is a valid year, then we should be accepting `+11` as a valid month as well. I guess it is because years can be negative as well, so signed months don't make sense in that way. But this is how it has been, so it would break code if we stop accepting it. \n\nI did verify that parseInt would break if we keep the `+` in its input. If that was the only reason to increment position, then I think this should fix it without any side effects. How can we check that?\n\nThere is definitely a bug, because `+20130101` gets interpreted as year 20130, month 10. It is happening because for the year part, `position` is incremented, but the `length` remains 4. So, the characters from position 1 to 1+4 (`20130`) get interpreted as the year. Then, the next two characters (`10`) get picked up as the month instead of `01`.\n","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/JodaOrg/joda-time/issues/comments/28692839/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"hshankar","id":415309,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQxNTMwOQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/415309?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hshankar","html_url":"https://github.com/hshankar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hshankar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hshankar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hshankar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hshankar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hshankar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hshankar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hshankar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hshankar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hshankar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/JodaOrg/joda-time/issues/comments/29281259","html_url":"https://github.com/JodaOrg/joda-time/issues/86#issuecomment-29281259","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/JodaOrg/joda-time/issues/86","id":29281259,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI5MjgxMjU5","user":{"login":"jodastephen","id":213212,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMzIxMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/213212?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jodastephen","html_url":"https://github.com/jodastephen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jodastephen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jodastephen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jodastephen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jodastephen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jodastephen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jodastephen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jodastephen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jodastephen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jodastephen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2013-11-26T10:23:20Z","updated_at":"2013-11-26T10:23:20Z","body":"The ISO standard only uses + when outputting 5 or more characters.

I notice this works fine:\n\n``` java\n/**\n     * https://github.com/JodaOrg/joda-time/issues/86\n     */\n    public void correctly_parses_plus_in_front_of_year() {\n        // Given: a date that includes + per the spec of allowing it for 5 digit years\n        //final String pattern = \"yyyyMMdd\";\n        //final String dateTime = \"+20130109\";\n        final String dateTime = \"+2013-01-09\";\n        // When: I try to parse this date\n        //final DateTime result = DateTimeFormat.forPattern(pattern).parseDateTime(dateTime);\n        final DateTime result = ISODateTimeFormat.dateTimeParser().parseDateTime(dateTime);\n        // Then: I get back the correct year\n        assertEquals(2013, result.getYear());\n        // And: I get back the correct month\n        assertEquals(1, result.getMonthOfYear());\n        // And: I get back the correct day\n        assertEquals(9, result.getDayOfMonth());\n    }\n```\n\nIt does seem strange to me to explicitly specify a pattern like `\"yyyyMMdd\"` and then expect ISO8601 dates to be accepted. \nThen again, that is specifically the pattern of http://joda-time.sourceforge.net/apidocs/org/joda/time/format/ISODateTimeFormat.html#basicDate%28%29\n\nWhy someone would manually specify that as a pattern instead of using `ISODateTimeFormat` is strange to me. I suppose an argument could be made that an input pattern could be checked against a list of known patterns for given formats and made to be tolerant of the idiosyncrasies of that format. If that were the case, I would expect `cPatternCache` to contain some known mappings instead of starting out empty. That also seems to open up complexity in trying to keep that mapping up-to-date. \n\nAlternately, for semantic clarity, I would expect the ISO definition of a year (with the strange +/- Y business https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601#Years) to only be applied in that case.
