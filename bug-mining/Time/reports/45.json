By defining a property such as\n\n-Dorg.joda.time.tz.data=path/to/files\n\nthe data files would be read in from the path provided; if no property was declared, it would default to its current behavior of loading the files it compiled when being packaged.  This could be used as a stop-gap until a solution described in #17 could be implemented.\n","closed_by":{"login":"jodastephen","id":213212,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMzIxMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/213212?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jodastephen","html_url":"https://github.com/jodastephen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jodastephen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jodastephen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jodastephen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jodastephen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jodastephen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jodastephen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jodastephen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jodastephen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jodastephen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/JodaOrg/joda-time/issues/37/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/JodaOrg/joda-time/issues/37/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
