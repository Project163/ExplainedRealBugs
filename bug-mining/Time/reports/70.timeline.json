Pull request #72 implements the methods you suggested.\n\nI agree that `double` does not really make sense in these APIs. The ideal way would be to provide a `RationalNumber` class and then an overload `Duration.multipliedBy(RationNumber multiplicand)`. Would you support such an approach? (Alternatively an overload `Duration.multipliedBy(long numerator, long denominator)` would suffice I think, but internally I'd implement that with a `RationalNumber` class as well, to handle reduction among other things).\n\nI would really like to see the `floor` and `ceil` methods in, because I have repeatedly had a need for them.\n","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/JodaOrg/joda-time/issues/comments/25496509/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"bjoernpollex","id":1698589,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2OTg1ODk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1698589?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bjoernpollex","html_url":"https://github.com/bjoernpollex","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bjoernpollex/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bjoernpollex/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bjoernpollex/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bjoernpollex/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bjoernpollex/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bjoernpollex/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bjoernpollex/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bjoernpollex/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bjoernpollex/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/JodaOrg/joda-time/issues/comments/25737819","html_url":"https://github.com/JodaOrg/joda-time/issues/69#issuecomment-25737819","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/JodaOrg/joda-time/issues/69","id":25737819,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI1NzM3ODE5","user":{"login":"jodastephen","id":213212,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMzIxMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/213212?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jodastephen","html_url":"https://github.com/jodastephen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jodastephen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jodastephen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jodastephen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jodastephen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jodastephen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jodastephen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jodastephen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jodastephen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jodastephen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2013-10-05T00:02:53Z","updated_at":"2013-10-05T00:02:53Z","body":"I
