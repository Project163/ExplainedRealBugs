The current time can be a normal dependency of a class, eg\n\n```\npublic class SomeClass {\n    private final MillisProvider millisProvider;\n\n    public SomeClass(MillisProvider millisProvider) {\n        this.millisProvider = millisProvider;\n    }\n\n    public void doSomething() {\n        long currentTime = millisProvider.getMillis();\n\n        // do something with the time\n    }\n}\n```\n\nA small improvement for this use case would be to provide a MillisProvider implementation for the current system time. So it could be used in production. Currently one has to write this implementation oneself.\n\nThis would be like Java 8 [Clock.systemDefaultZone()](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/time/Clock.html#systemDefaultZone--).\n\n`DateTimeUtils` has already a private field `SYSTEM_MILLIS_PROVIDER`. Maybe you could change it to public?\n","closed_by":{"login":"jodastephen","id":213212,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMzIxMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/213212?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jodastephen","html_url":"https://github.com/jodastephen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jodastephen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jodastephen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jodastephen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jodastephen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jodastephen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jodastephen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jodastephen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jodastephen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jodastephen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/JodaOrg/joda-time/issues/357/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/JodaOrg/joda-time/issues/357/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
