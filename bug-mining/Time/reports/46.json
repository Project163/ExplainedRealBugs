But I've noticed that in 2.6, all loading is lazy now, thus we would be able to insert our own provider before joda-time chooses its defaults.\n\nI'm interested in doing the Right Thing and including joda-time as a dependency but there's one more issue: JAR size. joda-time-android still needs to use our own provider with resources delivered by Android itself. If I use joda-time as a dependency then I'll be including all the resources 2x, which is a lot of extra space for an app.\n\nI was wondering if it would be feasible to create a version of joda-time that didn't include the TZ resources. Identical build, just minus that directory.\n\nThis is related to #37, but takes a different tact (rather than redefining where the resources are, removing them altogether so you can depend on your own provider).\n","closed_by":{"login":"jodastephen","id":213212,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMzIxMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/213212?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jodastephen","html_url":"https://github.com/jodastephen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jodastephen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jodastephen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jodastephen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jodastephen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jodastephen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jodastephen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jodastephen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jodastephen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jodastephen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/JodaOrg/joda-time/issues/220/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/JodaOrg/joda-time/issues/220/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
