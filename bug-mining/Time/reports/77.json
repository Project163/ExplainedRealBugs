The issue is that if the server relies on the default locale and if the process was started with some non English compatible locale such as Turkish, toUpper/Lower will yield an incorrect result. For instance \"URI\".toLowerCase() will result in \"urı\" instead of \"uri\". The same applies to toUpperCase -> \"uri\".toUpperCase() will become \"URİ\" and checks like \"string.toUpperCase().equals(someConstant)\" will fail.\n\nVERSION OF Joda-time is 2.7\n","closed_by":{"login":"jodastephen","id":213212,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMzIxMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/213212?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jodastephen","html_url":"https://github.com/jodastephen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jodastephen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jodastephen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jodastephen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jodastephen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jodastephen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jodastephen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jodastephen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jodastephen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jodastephen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/JodaOrg/joda-time/issues/397/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/JodaOrg/joda-time/issues/397/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
