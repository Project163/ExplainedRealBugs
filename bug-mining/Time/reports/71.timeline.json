https://github.com/JodaOrg/joda-time/commit/027bfdde0338f53fc0f20a18a447c52a3f7e02cd introduced a subtle timezone parsing bug into 2.9.x - the binary search implementation doesn't pivot on string length correctly. The material result is that some shorter timezone names won't resolve if there are names in the timezone list that contain the shorter name as a prefix. We encountered this with the timezone `\"Etc/GMT\"` failing to parse when we upgraded to 2.9.1. This has forced us to rollback to 2.8.2 pending a fix.
