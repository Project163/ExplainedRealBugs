This has two implications:\n1. It is impossible to parse strict with a given string pattern\n2. The `ISODateTimeFormat` is broken because this `2013-9-14` is **not** a valid ISO date string but \n\n``` java\nDateTimeFormatter isoParser = ISODateTimeFormat.date();\n\nLocalDate date = isoParser.parseLocalDate(\"2013-9-14\");\nSystem.out.println(date);\n```\n\nAccepts this input.
