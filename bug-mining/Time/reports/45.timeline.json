This would provide a way for Joda-Time to be able to consistently pick up the location of the new files, although it would require the JVM in which Joda-Time is running to cycle. Unfortunately we haven't been able to find a way that consistently allows for the new files to be on the classpath before what is bundled in with Joda-Time.\n\nI think I understand the way you are thinking of this; more of a holistic solution of providing new time zone information for consumers of Joda-Time without making them take an entirely new version of Joda-Time. If you want to do that, I think i would be entirely possible, but it would take more effort than what I think @derekdobler is suggesting. His suggestion, as I understand it, would leave the burden of providing the updated binaries read by Joda-Time up to the consumers only if they desired that functionality. Otherwise, the time zone information update mechanism for Joda-Time would continue as it currently

While the thread that was linked is an interesting idea, it would still require a rebuild in order to pick up the changes.  @alex-stark has the correct workflow for what we're trying to accomplish, some script to pick up the latest published version of the TZData and then a cycle to allow all applications using joda-time to get the updated rule sets (if a system property was set to point to this directory.)\n","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/JodaOrg/joda-time/issues/comments/21049036/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"derekdobler","id":4582003,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1ODIwMDM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4582003?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/derekdobler","html_url":"https://github.com/derekdobler","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/derekdobler/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/derekdobler/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/derekdobler/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/derekdobler/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/derekdobler/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/derekdobler/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/derekdobler/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/derekdobler/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/derekdobler/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":56718265,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50NTY3MTgyNjU=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/JodaOrg/joda-time/issues/events/56718265","actor":{"login":"alex-stark","id":4991128,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5OTExMjg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4991128?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alex-stark","html_url":"https://github.com/alex-stark","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alex-stark/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alex-stark/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alex-stark/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alex-stark/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alex-stark/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alex-stark/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alex-stark/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alex-stark/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alex-stark/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2013-07-16T15:16:47Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":56718266,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDU2NzE4MjY2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/JodaOrg/joda-time/issues/events/56718266","actor":{"login":"alex-stark","id":4991128,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5OTExMjg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4991128?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alex-stark","html_url":"https://github.com/alex-stark","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alex-stark/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alex-stark/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alex-stark/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alex-stark/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alex-stark/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alex-stark/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alex-stark/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alex-stark/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alex-stark/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2013-07-16T15:16:47Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/JodaOrg/joda-time/issues/comments/21052441","html_url":"https://github.com/JodaOrg/joda-time/issues/37#issuecomment-21052441","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/JodaOrg/joda-time/issues/37","id":21052441,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIxMDUyNDQx","user":{"login":"jodastephen","id":213212,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMzIxMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/213212?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jodastephen","html_url":"https://github.com/jodastephen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jodastephen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jodastephen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jodastephen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jodastephen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jodastephen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jodastephen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jodastephen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jodastephen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jodastephen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"cr
