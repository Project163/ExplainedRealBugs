Example:\n\n```\nDateTimeZone.setDefault(DateTimeZone.forID(\"Europe/London\"));\n\nDateTime now = DateTime.now(DateTimeZone.UTC));\nSystem.out.println(now); // 2015-03-31T11:20:14.923Z\nSystem.out.println(now.hourOfDay().roundFloorCopy()); // 2015-03-31T11:00:00.000Z\nSystem.out.println(now.hourOfDay().toInterval()); // 2015-03-31T12:00:00.000+01:00/2015-03-31T13:00:00.000+01:00\n```\n\nNote that the 1 hour offset to UTC reappears when calling toInterval despite starting with a DateTime in UTC. The [`toInterval` method](https://github.com/JodaOrg/joda-time/blob/4222b61dcefc4e621f6d016e0928da0280663f87/src/main/java/org/joda/time/field/AbstractReadableInstantFieldProperty.java#L369) on AbstractReadableInstantFieldProperty uses the Interval constructor with two long arguments, meaning the Interval is constructed using the default time zone, instead of the time zone of the DateTime.\n\nI noticed that [LocalDate](https://github.com/JodaOrg/joda-time/blob/4222b61dcefc4e621f6d016e0928da0280663f87/src/main/java/org/joda/time/LocalDate.java#L991) and [DateMidnight](https://github.com/JodaOrg/joda-time/blob/4222b61dcefc4e621f6d016e0928da0280663f87/src/main/java/org/joda/time/DateMidnight.java#L894) have either an overloaded `toInterval` that takes a DateTimeZone parameter, or use the time zone of the object itself. Is the above behaviour intentional, or should all three methods behave in a similar way, e.g. should there be an overloaded method in AbstractReadableInstantFieldProperty?\n\nCurrently the only way around this (other than building a custom toInterval method) seems to be the following:\n\n```\nSystem.out.println(now.hourOfDay().toInterval().withChronology(ISOChronology.getInstanceUTC())); // 2015-03-31T11:00:00.000Z/2015-03-31T12:00:00.000Z\n```\n\nwhich is very long-winded.\n","closed_by":{"login":"jodastephen","id":213212,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMzIxMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/213212?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jodastephen","html_url":"https://github.com/jodastephen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jodastephen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jodastephen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jodastephen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jodastephen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jodastephen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jodastephen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jodastephen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jodastephen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jodastephen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/JodaOrg/joda-time/issues/262/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/JodaOrg/joda-time/issues/262/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
