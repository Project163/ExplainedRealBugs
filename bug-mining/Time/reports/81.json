I'm using 2.9.7, but you can see the problem by reading the current master as well.\r\n- Time zone not important\r\n\r\n### Problem description\r\n\r\n`DateTimePrinterInternalPrinter#printTo` is implemented as follows:\r\n\r\n        public void printTo(Appendable appendable, ReadablePartial partial, Locale locale) throws IOException {\r\n            if (appendable instanceof StringBuffer) {\r\n                StringBuffer buf = (StringBuffer) appendable;\r\n                underlying.printTo(buf, partial, locale);\r\n            }\r\n            if (appendable instanceof Writer) {\r\n                Writer out = (Writer) appendable;\r\n                underlying.printTo(out, partial, locale);\r\n            }\r\n            StringBuffer buf = new StringBuffer(estimatePrintedLength());\r\n            underlying.printTo(buf, partial, locale);\r\n            appendable.append(buf);\r\n        }\r\n\r\nThe other override has the same problem.\r\n\r\nSince neither if-block returns after appending, if you do pass in something which is a StringBuffer or a Writer, you end up with the text coming out twice in the resulting formatted date.\r\n\r\n### Test case\r\n\r\n    @Test\r\n    public void testCustomDateTimePrinter() {\r\n        DateTimePrinter printer = new DateTimeFormatterBuilder()\r\n                .append(new CustomDateTimePrinter())\r\n                .appendLiteral(' ')\r\n                .appendYear(4, 8)\r\n                .toPrinter();\r\n\r\n        StringBuffer buffer = new StringBuffer();\r\n        DateTimeZone zone = DateTimeZone.UTC;\r\n        Chronology chronology = ISOChronology.getInstance(zone);\r\n        long instant = new DateTime(2017, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, chronology).getMillis();\r\n        printer.printTo(buffer, instant, chronology, 0, zone, Locale.ROOT);\r\n\r\n        assertThat(buffer.toString(), is(equalTo(\"Hi 2017\")));\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    private static class CustomDateTimePrinter implements DateTimePrinter {\r\n        @Override\r\n        public int estimatePrintedLength() {\r\n            return 2;\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        @Override\r\n        public void printTo(StringBuffer buf, long instant, Chronology chrono, int displayOffset, DateTimeZone displayZone, Locale locale) {\r\n            buf.append(\"Hi\");\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        @Override\r\n        public void printTo(Writer out, long instant, Chronology chrono, int displayOffset, DateTimeZone displayZone, Locale locale) throws IOException {\r\n            out.write(\"Hi\");\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        @Override\r\n        public void printTo(StringBuffer buf, ReadablePartial partial, Locale locale) {\r\n            buf.append(\"Hi\");\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        @Override\r\n        public void printTo(Writer out, ReadablePartial partial, Locale locale) throws IOException {\r\n            out.write(\"hi\");\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\n### Result\r\n\r\n    java.lang.AssertionError: \r\n    Expected: is \"Hi 2017\"\r\n         but: was \"HiHi 2017\"\r\n\r\n### Workaround\r\n\r\nNot entirely sure. I'd say pass in another kind of Appendable (like StringBuilder), but it looks like the external API just doesn't let me pass in any kind. :(\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"jodastephen","id":213212,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMzIxMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/213212?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jodastephen","html_url":"https://github.com/jodastephen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jodastephen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jodastephen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jodastephen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jodastephen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jodastephen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jodastephen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jodastephen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jodastephen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jodastephen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/JodaOrg/joda-time/issues/409/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/JodaOrg/joda-time/issues/409/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
