for the response, but, reading in the class description, http://joda-time.sourceforge.net/apidocs/org/joda/time/MonthDay.html one of the uses for this class is to store birthdays.\n\nThat's the usage we also do in our code: I understand your point about defaulting to 1970, but for a class that is called MonthDay, surely the year shouldn't be mandatory to perform calculation.\n\nAlso, I've tested another case:\n\nnew MonthDay(new LocalDateTime(2013, 03, 01, 15, 00)).minusDays(200);\n\nthis fails as well with:\norg.joda.time.IllegalFieldValueException: Value 29 for dayOfMonth must be in the range [1,28]\n    at org.joda.time.field.FieldUtils.verifyValueBounds(FieldUtils.java:217)\n    at org.joda.time.field.PreciseDurationDateTimeField.set(PreciseDurationDateTimeField.java:78)\n    at org.joda.time.chrono.BasicMonthOfYearDateTimeField.add(BasicMonthOfYearDateTimeField.java:212)\n    at org.joda.time.field.BaseDateTimeField.add(BaseDateTimeField.java:344)\n    at org.joda.time.MonthDay.withFieldAdded(MonthDay.java:519)\n    at org.joda.time.MonthDay.minusDays(MonthDay.java:672)\n\nalthough I'm not 100% as, if I do: \nnew MonthDay(new LocalDateTime(2013, 03, 01, 15, 00)).minusDays(1);\n\nthe test passes.\n\nWhat I guess I'm trying to say is that, I approached MonthDay to perform calculations for birthdays related problem, but it seems that is somewhat buggy on the fringes with this problem for leap year or not.\n\nThanks!\n","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/JodaOrg/joda-time/issues/comments/18938597/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"cleverbug","id":2648612,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2NDg2MTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2648612?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cleverbug","html_url":"https://github.com/cleverbug","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cleverbug/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cleverbug/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cleverbug/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cleverbug/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cleverbug/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cleverbug/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cleverbug/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cleverbug/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cleverbug/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/JodaOrg/joda-time/issues/comments/18966953","html_url":"https://github.com/JodaOrg/joda-time/issues/22#issuecomment-18966953","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/JodaOrg/joda-time/issues/22","id":18966953,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE4OTY2OTUz","user":{"login":"jodastephen","id":213212,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMzIxMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/213212?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jodastephen","html_url":"https://github.com/jodastephen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jodastephen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jodastephen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jodastephen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jodastephen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jodastephen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jodastephen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jodastephen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jodastephen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jodastephen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2013-06-05T10:17:26Z","updated_at":"2013-06-05T10:17:26Z","body":"Yes
