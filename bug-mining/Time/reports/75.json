These should read (respectively):\n\"Returns: true if this duration is equal to the duration passed in\"\n\"Returns: true if this duration is strictly greater than the duration passed in\"\n\"Returns: true if this duration is strictly shorter than the duration passed in\"\n\nWhile this might seem obvious, My test case was writing:\nif (myDuration.isGreaterThan(Duration.standardDays(1))) {...}\n\nIn which case, I was not quite sure if the comparison was strict (>) or with equal (>=). The provided documentation was not clear enough for me to figure out the provided behavior, and I had to look at the code to know.
