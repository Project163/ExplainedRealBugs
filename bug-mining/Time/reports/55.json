Also, from what I can tell, having `Period`s with negative fields is permitted. Both are true of `Duration`. Let me know if either are not supported for `Period`.\n\nHere's an example:\n\n```\nPeriod pExpected = Period.new(0, 0, 0, -1); // negative 1 millisecond\nString correctString = pExpected.toString(); // \"PT-0.001S\"\nPeriod pActual = Period.parse(correctString); // positive 1 millisecond\n```\n\nHopefully that works. I'm using joda-time from Clojure, so I don't have a proper Java environment setup. I wanted to check with you before I tried to get the tests running, etc., and attempt a fix.\n\nIn case it helps, here is my original Clojure test, from which this was extracted:\n\n```\n(let [p (org.joda.time.Period. 0 0 0 -1)]\n  (= p\n     (org.joda.time.Period/parse (.toString p)))) ; => returns false\n```\n","closed_by":{"login":"jodastephen","id":213212,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMzIxMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/213212?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jodastephen","html_url":"https://github.com/jodastephen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jodastephen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jodastephen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jodastephen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jodastephen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jodastephen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jodastephen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jodastephen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jodastephen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jodastephen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/JodaOrg/joda-time/issues/238/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/JodaOrg/joda-time/issues/238/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
