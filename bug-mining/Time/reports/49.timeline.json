instances created with help of PeriodFormat class.\n\nAddresses issue #187 \n\nIt is not something that can be fixed. In my opinion this method should not be there. I suppose it was added during early design.\nThe value of locale is never used internally (it is passed around, only meaningful usage is the getter - but unless the locale is set with withLocale method it the getter will return null). The PeriodFormat and the PeriodFormatterBuilder never returns a PeriodFormatter with locale different than null.\n\nAs to why it is rather not possible to make this method work as one would expect:\nThe PeriodFormatter contains all of the localized strings required for the it to work. It is does NOT use the stored locale value to pick localized strings during printing/parsing.\nPeriodFormatter not only defines the locale but the order of displaying each of the values, prefixes, suffixes etc. One can define a PeriodFormatter so that the year suffix will be 'qwerty' and the month suffix will be 'wsad' and the separator between them will be 'backspace' (you get the picture). I the case like that what kind of PeriodFormatter should be returned from call to withLocale(Locale.CANADA_FRENCH) - I do not know what is the French word for 'backspace', neither does PeriodFormatter class. :-)\n\nWe could return a wordBased PeriodFormatter, but I think it is a bad idea - the returned PeriodFormatter would have nothing from the PeriodFormatter instance that the withLocale() was called upon.\n\nI think we should:\n- mark this method as deprecated,\n- warn that this method does not return a PeriodFormatter that behaves differently than the first one,\n- update the PeriodFormat class to produce PeriodFormatter instances with locale different that null.\n\nThis pull request does that.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/JodaOrg/joda-time/issues/191/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/JodaOrg/joda-time/issues/191/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":217161709,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MjE3MTYxNzA5","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/JodaOrg/joda-time/issues/events/217161709","actor":{"login":"jodastephen","id":213212,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMzIxMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/213212?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jodastephen","html_url":"https://github.com/jodastephen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jodastephen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jodastephen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jodastephen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jodastephen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jodastephen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jodastephen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jodastephen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jodastephen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jodastephen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":"e0958a6e0e98d656c0da5d523f4d7fca58e116d1","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/JodaOrg/joda-time/commits/e0958a6e0e98d656c0da5d523f4d7fca58e116d1","created_at":"2015-01-12T00:09:57Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":217168050,"node_id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDIxNzE2ODA1MA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/JodaOrg/joda-time/issues/events/217168050","actor":{"login":"jodastephen","id":213212,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMzIxMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/213212?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jodastephen","html_url":"https://github.com/jodastephen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jodastephen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jodastephen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jodastephen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jodastephen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jodastephen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jodastephen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jodastephen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jodastephen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jodastephen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2015-01-12T01:00:15Z","label":{"name":"Fixed","color":"009800"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":419274294,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDQxOTI3NDI5NA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/JodaOrg/joda-time/issues/events/419274294","actor":{"login":"Guardiola31337","id":1668582,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2Njg1ODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1668582?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Guardiola31337","html_url":"https://github.com/Guardiola31337","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Guardiola31337/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Guardiola31337/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Guardiola31337/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Guardiola31337/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Guardiola31337/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Guardiola31337/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Guardiola31337/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Guardiola31337/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Guardiola31337/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"fa438c722cf75a0a1365cf95998dd42cec50d8eb","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Guardiola31337/joda-time/commits/fa438c722cf75a0a1365cf95998dd42cec50d8eb","created_at":"2015-09-25T15:25:34Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
