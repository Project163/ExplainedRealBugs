 === Rolling Upgrades
 
+WARNING: Rolling upgrades from Solr 8 to Solr 9 require upgrading from Solr 8.7 or newer.
+
 * SOLR-14702: All references to "master" and "slave" were replaced in the code with "leader" and "follower".
 This includes API calls for the replication handler and metrics.
-For rolling upgrades into 9.0, you need to be on Solr version 8.7 or greater. Some metrics also changed, alerts and monitors on Solr KPIs that mention "master" or "slave" will also now be "leader" and "follower"

 * SOLR-15965: Internode communication secured by PKI Authentication has changed formats. For detailed information, see
   xref:deployment-guide:authentication-and-authorization-plugins.adoc#pkiauthenticationplugin[PKI Authentication Plugin].
   A rolling upgrade from Solr 8 to Solr 9 requires the following multiple restart sequence:
-** Either:
-*** Upgrade to Solr 8.11.2 or newer
-*** Upgrade to Solr 9 and set system properties: `solr.pki.sendVersion=v1` and `solr.pki.acceptVersions=v1,v2`
-** Upgrade to Solr 9 with `solr.pki.acceptVersions=v1,v2`. If you had already upgraded to Solr 9 in the previous step, this will be a rolling restart, not upgrade.
-** (Optional) A rolling restart with system property `solr.pki.acceptVersions=v2` to prevent outdated nodes from connecting to your cluster.
+1. Upgrade to Solr 9 and set system properties: `solr.pki.sendVersion=v1` and `solr.pki.acceptVersions=v1,v2`. This will allow Solr 9 nodes to send messages to Solr 8 nodes while the upgrade is in progress.
+2. Restart with `solr.pki.sendVersion=v2` (default, can be unset) and `solr.pki.acceptVersions=v1,v2`. This will force all nodes to send the new header.
+3. (Optional) Restart with system property `solr.pki.acceptVersions=v2` (default, can be unset) to prevent outdated nodes from connecting to your cluster.
