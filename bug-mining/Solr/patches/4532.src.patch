 For very high cost filters, if `cache=false` and `cost>=100` and the query implements the `PostFilter` interface, a Collector will be requested from that query and used to filter documents after they have matched the main query and all other filter queries. There can be multiple post filters; they are also ordered by cost.

 The `maxRamMB` attribute limits the maximum amount of memory a cache may consume. When both `size` and `maxRamMB` limits are specified the `maxRamMB` limit will take precedence and the `size` limit will be ignored.
 
+All caches can be disabled using the parameter `enabled` with a value of `false`. Caches can also be disabled on a query-by-query basis with the `cache` parameter, as described in the section <<common-query-parameters.adoc#cache-parameter,cache Parameter>>.
