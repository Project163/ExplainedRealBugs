 == The Block Cache
 
-For performance, the HdfsDirectoryFactory uses a Directory that will cache HDFS blocks. This caching mechanism is meant to replace the standard file system cache that Solr utilizes so much. By default, this cache is allocated off heap. This cache will often need to be quite large and you may need to raise the off heap memory limit for the specific JVM you are running Solr in. For the Oracle/OpenJDK JVMs, the follow is an example command line parameter that you can use to raise the limit when starting Solr:

-== Automatically Add Replicas in SolrCloud
-
-One benefit to running Solr in HDFS is the ability to automatically add new replicas when the Overseer notices that a shard has gone down. Because the "gone" index shards are stored in HDFS, the a new core will be created and the new core will point to the existing indexes in HDFS.
-
-Collections created using `autoAddReplicas=true` on a shared file system have automatic addition of replicas enabled. The following settings can be used to override the defaults in the `<solrcloud>` section of `solr.xml`.
-
-`autoReplicaFailoverWorkLoopDelay`::
-The time (in ms) between clusterstate inspections by the Overseer to detect and possibly act on creation of a replacement replica. The default is `10000`.
+// In Solr 8, this should be removed entirely;
+// it's here now only for back-compat for existing users
 
-`autoReplicaFailoverWaitAfterExpiration`::
-The minimum time (in ms) to wait for initiating replacement of a replica after first noticing it not being live. This is important to prevent false positives while stoping or starting the cluster. The default is `30000`.
-
-`autoReplicaFailoverBadNodeExpiration`::
-The delay (in ms) after which a replica marked as down would be unmarked. The default is `60000`.
+== Automatically Add Replicas in SolrCloud
 
-=== Temporarily Disable autoAddReplicas for the Entire Cluster
+The ability to automatically add new replicas when the Overseer notices that a shard has gone down was previously only available to users running Solr in HDFS, but it is now available to all users via Solr's autoscaling framework. See the section <<solrcloud-autoscaling-triggers.adoc#auto-add-replicas-trigger,Auto Add Replicas Trigger>> for details on how to enable and disable this feature.

+The ability to enable or disable the autoAddReplicas feature with cluster properties has been deprecated and will be removed in a future version.
