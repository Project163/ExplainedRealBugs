 When retrieving fields from their docValues form (using the <<exporting-result-sets.adoc#exporting-result-sets,/export handler>>, <<streaming-expressions.adoc#streaming-expressions,streaming expressions>> or if the field is requested in the `fl` parameter), two important differences between regular stored fields and docValues fields must be understood:
