+==================  8.0.0 ==================
+
+Consult the LUCENE_CHANGES.txt file for additional, low level, changes in this release.
+
+Versions of Major Components
+---------------------
+Apache Tika 1.19.1
+Carrot2 3.16.0
+Velocity 1.7 and Velocity Tools 2.0
+Apache ZooKeeper 3.4.11
+Jetty 9.4.11.v20180605
+
+Upgrade Notes
+----------------------
+
+* LUCENE-7996: The 'func' query parser now returns scores that are equal to 0
+  when a negative value is produced. This change is due to the fact that
+  Lucene now requires scores to be positive. (Adrien Grand)
+
+* SOLR-11882: SolrMetric registries retained references to SolrCores when closed. A
+  change of SolrMetricMAnager.registerGauge and SolrMetricProducer.initializeMetrics
+  method signatures was required to fix it. Third party components that use this API
+  need to be updated. (Eros Taborelli, Erick Erickson, ab)
+
+* LUCENE-8267: Memory codecs have been removed from the codebase (MemoryPostings,
+  MemoryDocValues). If you used postingsFormat="Memory" or docValuesFormat="Memory"
+  then either remove it to use the default or experiment with one of the others. (Dawid Weiss)
+
+* SOLR-12586: The date format patterns used by ParseDateFieldUpdateProcessorFactory (present in "schemaless mode")
+  are now interpreted by Java 8's java.time.DateTimeFormatter instead of Joda Time.  The pattern language is very
+  similar but not the same.  Typically, simply update the pattern by changing an uppercase 'Z' to lowercase 'z' and
+  that's it.  For the current recommended set of patterns in schemaless mode, see "Schemaless Mode" in the ref guide,
+  or simply examine the default configSet.  Also note that the set of patterns (formats) here have
+  expanded from before to subsume those patterns previously handled by the "extract" contrib (Solr Cell / Tika).
+  (David Smiley, Bar Rotstein)
+
+* SOLR-12593: The "extraction" contrib (Solr Cell) no longer does any date parsing, and thus no longer has the
+  "date.formats" configuration.  To ensure date strings are properly parsed, use ParseDateFieldUpdateProcessorFactory
+  (an URP) commonly registered with the name "parse-date" in "schemaless mode".  (David Smiley, Bar Rotstein)
+
+* SOLR-12754: The UnifiedHighlighter hl.weightMatches now defaults to true.  If there are unforseen highlight problems,
+  this may be the culprit.
+
+New Features
+----------------------
+
+* SOLR-12591: Expand the set of recognized date format patterns of schemaless mode to subsume those handled by the
+  "extract" contrib (Solr Cell / Tika).  This is primarily a change in configuration of the default configSet for more
+  patterns, but also included enabling "lenient" parsing in ParseDateFieldUpdateProcessorFactory.  The default
+  locale was changed from ROOT to en_US since well-known patterns assume this locale.
+  (David Smiley, Bar Rotstein)
+
+* SOLR-12879: MinHash query parser that builds queries providing a measure of Jaccard similarity (Andy Hind via Tommaso Teofili)
+
+* SOLR-12593: The default configSet now includes an "ignored_*" dynamic field.  (David Smiley)
+
+Optimizations
+----------------------
+
+* SOLR-12725: ParseDateFieldUpdateProcessorFactory should reuse ParsePosition. (ab)
+
+Other Changes
+----------------------
+
+* SOLR-12614: Make "Nodes" view the default in AdminUI "Cloud" tab (janhoy)
+
+* SOLR-12586: Upgrade ParseDateFieldUpdateProcessorFactory (present in "schemaless mode") to use Java 8's
+  java.time.DateTimeFormatter instead of Joda time (see upgrade notes).  "Lenient" is enabled.  Removed Joda Time dependency.
+  (David Smiley, Bar Rotstein)
+
+* SOLR-5163: edismax now throws an exception when qf refers to a nonexistent field (Charles Sanders, David Smiley)
+
+* SOLR-12805: Store previous term (generation) of replica when start recovery process (Cao Manh Dat)
+
+* SOLR-12652: Remove SolrMetricManager.overridableRegistryName method (Peter Somogyi via David Smiley)
+
+* LUCENE-8513: SlowCompositeReaderWrapper now uses MultiTerms directly instead of MultiFields (David Smiley)
+
+* SOLR-11812: Remove backward compatibility of old LIR implementation in 8.0 (Cao Manh Dat)
+
+* SOLR-12620: Remove the Admin UI Cloud -> Graph (Radial) view (janhoy)
