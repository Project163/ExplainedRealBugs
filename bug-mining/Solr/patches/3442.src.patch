-For Simplified Chinese, Solr provides support for Chinese sentence and word segmentation with the <<LanguageAnalysis-HMMChineseTokenizerFactory,HMM Chinese Tokenizer`>>. This component includes a large dictionary and segments Chinese text into words with the Hidden Markov Model. To use this tokenizer, you must add additional .jars to Solr's classpath (as described in the section <<lib-directives-in-solrconfig.adoc#lib-directives-in-solrconfig,Lib Directives in SolrConfig>>). See the `solr/contrib/analysis-extras/README.txt` for information on which jars you need to add to your `SOLR_HOME/lib`.

 The default configuration of the <<tokenizers.adoc#Tokenizers-ICUTokenizer,ICU Tokenizer>> is also suitable for Simplified Chinese text.  It follows the Word Break rules from the Unicode Text Segmentation algorithm for non-Chinese text, and uses a dictionary to segment Chinese words.
