-The first configurable item is the `handleSelect` attribute on the `<requestDispatcher>` element itself. This attribute can be set to one of two values, either "true" or "false". It governs how Solr responds to requests such as `/select?qt=XXX`. The default value "false" will ignore requests to `/select` if a requestHandler is not explicitly registered with the name `/select`. A value of "true" will route query requests to the parser defined with the `qt` value.
