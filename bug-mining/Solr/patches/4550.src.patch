 In most cases, when running in SolrCloud mode, indexing client applications should not send explicit commit requests. Rather, you should configure auto commits with `openSearcher=false` and auto soft-commits to make recent updates visible in search requests. This ensures that auto commits occur on a regular schedule in the cluster.
 
+NOTE: Using auto soft commit or commitWithin requires the client app to embrace the realities of "eventual consistency". Solr will make documents searchable at _roughly_ the same time across replicas of a collection but there are no hard guarantees. Consequently, in rare cases, it's possible for a document to show up in one search only for it not to appear in a subsequent search occurring immediately after the first search when the second search is routed to a different replica. Also, documents added in a particular order (even in the same batch) might become searchable out of the order of submission when there is sharding. The document will become visible on all replicas of a shard after the next auto commit or commitWithin interval expires

 To enforce a policy where client applications should not send explicit commits, you should update all client applications that index data into SolrCloud. However, that is not always feasible, so Solr provides the `IgnoreCommitOptimizeUpdateProcessorFactory`, which allows you to ignore explicit commits and/or optimize requests from client applications without having refactor your client application code.
 
 To activate this request processor you'll need to add the following to your `solrconfig.xml`:
