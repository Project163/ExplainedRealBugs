 This time interval should be set according to how often you update your index and whether or not it is acceptable for your application to use content that is somewhat out of date.
 Setting `must-revalidate` will tell the client to validate with the server that its cached copy is still good before re-using it.
 This will ensure that the most timely result is used, while avoiding a second fetch of the content if it isn't needed, at the cost of a request to the server to do the check.
