 The Blob Store REST API provides REST methods to store, retrieve or list files in a Lucene index.

+== Deleting Blobs
+
+Once loaded to the blob store, blobs are handled very similarly to usual indexed documents in Solr.
+To delete blobs, you can use the same approaches used to delete individual documents from the index,
+namely Delete By ID and Delete By Query.
+
+For example, to delete a blob with the id `test/1`, you would issue a command like this:
+
+[source,text]
+curl -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{"delete": {"id": "test/1"}}' http://localhost:8983/solr/.system/update?commit=true
+
+Be sure to tell Solr to perform a <<updatehandlers-in-solrconfig.adoc#commits,commit>> as part of the request
+ (`commit=true` in the above example) to see the change immediately.
+If you do not instruct Solr to perform a commit, Solr will use the `.system` collection autoCommit settings,
+which may not be the expected behavior.
+
+You can also use the delete by query syntax, as so:
+
+[source,text]
+curl -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{"delete": {"query": "id:test/1"}}' http://localhost:8983/solr/.system/update?commit=true
+
+For more on deleting documents generally, see the section <<uploading-data-with-index-handlers.adoc#sending-json-update-commands,Sending JSON Update Commands>>.
