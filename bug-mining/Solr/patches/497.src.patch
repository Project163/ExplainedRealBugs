+In trunk this contrib module is currently disabled, as it uses the external
+(binary) Carrot2 library (as trunk is free to change its API, this module fails
+with linking exceptions).
+
+After a stable branch of Lucene is created from trunk, rename
+'build.xml.disabled' back to 'build.xml' after replacing the Carrot2
+JARs by updated versions.
