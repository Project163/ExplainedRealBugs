-This script processes all static html files for Solr's refernce guide
-and downloads external JS and CSS files to local folders js/ and css/ for
-each version. It also updates the HTML files to reference the local files.
-Context is that ASF policy for web sites changed to not allow external
-references to JS and CSS files, and these sites were generated long ago.
+This script processes all static html files for Solr's reference guide
+and adds canonical URLs for old pages (Solr 6 - Solr 8, Solr 9+ should not
+be affected). Since Google doesn't always respect the canonical URL
+directive, the meta tag for robots "noindex" is also added to ensure these
+outdated pages do not show up on Google search results.
+This script uses the same logic as the htaccess generation script to
+determine which pages are the "last" versions of that page, so that it can
+be indexed by google as the most recent information.
