+* SOLR-4051: Add <propertyWriter /> element to DIH's data-config.xml file,  
+  allowing the user to specify the location, filename and Locale for
+  the "data-config.properties" file.  Alternatively, users can specify their
+  own property writer implementation for greater control. This new configuration 
+  element is optional, and defaults mimic prior behavior.  The one exception is 
+  that the "root" locale is default. Previously it was the machine' default locale.
