 The `parallel` function wraps a streaming expression and sends it to N worker nodes to be processed in parallel.
 
-The parallel function requires that the `partitionKeys` parameter be provided to the underlying searches. The `partitionKeys` parameter will partition the search results (tuples) across the worker nodes. Tuples with the same values in the partitionKeys field will be shuffled to the same worker nodes.

-For example if you sort on year, month and day you could partition on year only as long as there was enough different years to spread the tuples around the worker nodes.
-Solr allows sorting on more than 4 fields, but you cannot specify more than 4 partitionKeys for speed tradeoffs. Also it's an overkill to specify many partitionKeys when we one or two keys could be enough to spread the tuples.
-Parallel Stream was designed when the underlying search stream will emit a lot of tuples from the collection. If the search stream only emits a small subset of the data from the collection using parallel could potentially be slower.

 .Worker Collections
 [TIP]
 ====
-The worker nodes can be from the same collection as the data, or they can be a different collection entirely, even one that only exists for parallel streaming expressions. A worker collection can be any SolrCloud collection that has the `/stream` handler configured. Unlike normal SolrCloud collections, worker collections don't have to hold any data. Worker collections can be empty collections that exist only to execute streaming expressions.
