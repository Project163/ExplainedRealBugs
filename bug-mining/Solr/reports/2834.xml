            <title>[SOLR-8416] The collections create API should return after all replicas are active. </title>
                <link>https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SOLR-8416</link>
                <project id="12310230" key="SOLR">Solr</project>
                    <description>&lt;p&gt;Currently the collection creation API returns once all cores are created. In large cluster the cores may not be alive for some period of time after cores are created. For any thing requested during that period, Solr appears unstable and can return failure. Therefore it&apos;s better  the collection creation API waits for all cores to become alive and returns after that.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;1. The patch pulls shard status from zk and returns if they are all active during preset time or throw exception.  An alternative is to wait for zk notifications but I am not sure how much is the gain.&lt;br/&gt;
2. The total wait time should be configurable to fit large cluster. Is it good to be a solr config or collection config? It&apos;s more natural to be collection config but it may be easy for user if it&apos;s a solr config that can be set in CM.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Usually it&apos;s better to use SolrException over RuntimeException&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Where you catch the interrupted exception, you should restore the interrupted status.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The failure exception should probably give detail on which replicas were not found to be live and ACTIVE.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Should not use hard coded &apos;active&apos; but the relevant constants.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Should probably check if the replicas node is listed under live nodes as well as if it&apos;s active?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I agree, the complication is probably not worth it.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Is it good to be a solr config or collection config?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would make it a solr config - we need that ease of use at least. Later, if someone wants to override per collection or something, we can look at adding that in a way that you can override.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>

                            <comment id="15061258" author="gchanan" created="Thu, 17 Dec 2015 01:03:54 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;The patch claims to be looking at all shards being active but is actually looking at all replicas being active, right?  It&apos;s also inconsistent with the other creation commands now, e.g. CREATESHARD/ADDREPLICA will return as soon as the replicas are created while this will wait until all the replicas are active.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From a client perspective, what do you actually want?  I don&apos;t think it&apos;s that all replicas are active at one time; given a large enough cluster that can be unlikely.  Some possibilities:&lt;br/&gt;
1) all the replicas were able to become active (you&apos;d have to track this separately)&lt;br/&gt;
2) the collection is &quot;usable&quot; from the client &amp;#8211; each shard has a leader that is live and active?&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="15061272" author="michael.sun" created="Thu, 17 Dec 2015 01:20:28 +0000"  >&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;the collection is &quot;usable&quot; from the client &#8211; each shard has a leader that is live and active?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From client perspective, the collection or cluster is usable if the leader is active. However if high load of indexing starts before all replica becomes active, I am not sure if there will be too much sync traffic once replica starts. &lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="15061287" author="markrmiller@gmail.com" created="Thu, 17 Dec 2015 01:32:15 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;Yeah, the load is a good point. It&apos;s a lot harder to go active once a load is started. And you would hope that right after creating the collection, everything would actually be healthy, but I see Greg&apos;s point too. I&apos;ve always wrestled a bit with these ideas when considering this feature. It&apos;s not easy to make everything happy.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="15061319" author="gchanan" created="Thu, 17 Dec 2015 02:03:06 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;I&apos;d see what hbase or other systems do.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="15061338" author="michael.sun" created="Thu, 17 Dec 2015 02:23:45 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;Yeah. It&apos;s not easy to make tradeoff, in particular optimized for large cluster and high load like this. In addition to looking at other systems, another choice (which probably always works) is to add an option to allow user to decide if Solr should wait for all shard leaders to be active or all replicas at run time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The additional option need to be documented and adds a bit to the learning curve for users. But in general it won&apos;t create much burden since users usually are prepared to do some extra optimization for large cluster under high load. &lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="15062197" author="michael.sun" created="Thu, 17 Dec 2015 15:35:39 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;Just upload an updated patch for discussion. Here is the changes&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1. add a property to set max wait time&lt;br/&gt;
2. add a property to decide if it waits for all shard leaders to be active or all replicas&lt;br/&gt;
3. fix issues in &lt;a href=&quot;https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/ViewProfile.jspa?name=markrmiller%40gmail.com&quot; class=&quot;user-hover&quot; rel=&quot;markrmiller@gmail.com&quot;&gt;markrmiller@gmail.com&lt;/a&gt;&apos;s review except for the following one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Should probably check if the replicas node is listed under live nodes as well as if it&apos;s active?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

                            <comment id="15062370" author="markrmiller@gmail.com" created="Thu, 17 Dec 2015 17:19:18 +0000"  >&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Should probably check if the replicas node is listed under live nodes as well as if it&apos;s active?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Can you give me more details about it?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For technical reasons, the actual state of a replica is a combination of whether it&apos;s ephemeral live node exists in zookeeper and the state listed in the cluster state. We make a best effort on shutdown to publish DOWN for all the states, but it&apos;s simply best effort and crashes and other probably common things can mean any state is in the cluster state. You can really only count on it being an accurate state if you also check that the node is live. The ClusterState object has a helper method for this if I remember right. &lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="15062659" author="michael.sun" created="Thu, 17 Dec 2015 19:46:28 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;Here is an updated patch which includes checking for live nodes.

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Looks like a bunch of imports were moved above the license header?&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;We probably want to use real solr.xml config for this. Or make it params for the collection create call with reasonable defaults. We generally only use system properties for kind of internal fail safe options we don&apos;t expect to really be used. I&apos;d be fine with reasonable defaults that could be overridden per collection create call, but we could also allow the defaults to be configurable via solr.xml.
&lt;div class=&quot;code panel&quot; style=&quot;border-width: 1px;&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;codeContent panelContent&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;code-java&quot;&gt;+    &lt;span class=&quot;code-object&quot;&gt;Integer&lt;/span&gt; numRetries = &lt;span class=&quot;code-object&quot;&gt;Integer&lt;/span&gt;.getInteger(&lt;span class=&quot;code-quote&quot;&gt;&quot;createCollectionWaitTimeTillActive&quot;&lt;/span&gt;, 10);
+    &lt;span class=&quot;code-object&quot;&gt;Boolean&lt;/span&gt; checkLeaderOnly = &lt;span class=&quot;code-object&quot;&gt;Boolean&lt;/span&gt;.getBoolean(&lt;span class=&quot;code-quote&quot;&gt;&quot;createCollectionCheckLeaderActive&quot;&lt;/span&gt;);
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;We should handle the checked exceptions this might throw like we do in other spots rather than use a catch-all Exception. There should be plenty of code to reference where we handle keeper and interrupted exception and do the right thing for each.
&lt;div class=&quot;code panel&quot; style=&quot;border-width: 1px;&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;codeContent panelContent&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;code-java&quot;&gt;+      &lt;span class=&quot;code-keyword&quot;&gt;try&lt;/span&gt; {
+        zkStateReader.updateClusterState();
+        clusterState = zkStateReader.getClusterState();
+      }  &lt;span class=&quot;code-keyword&quot;&gt;catch&lt;/span&gt; (Exception e) {
+        &lt;span class=&quot;code-keyword&quot;&gt;throw&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;code-keyword&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; SolrException(ErrorCode.SERVER_ERROR, &lt;span class=&quot;code-quote&quot;&gt;&quot;Can&apos;t connect to zk server&quot;&lt;/span&gt;, e);
+      }
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;I&apos;d probably combine the following into one IF statement:
&lt;div class=&quot;code panel&quot; style=&quot;border-width: 1px;&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;codeContent panelContent&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;code-java&quot;&gt;+          &lt;span class=&quot;code-keyword&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; (!clusterState.liveNodesContain(replica.getNodeName())) {
+            replicaNotAlive = replica.getCoreUrl();
+            nodeNotLive = replica.getNodeName();
+            &lt;span class=&quot;code-keyword&quot;&gt;break&lt;/span&gt;;
+          }
+          &lt;span class=&quot;code-keyword&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; (!state.equals(Replica.State.ACTIVE.toString())) {
+            replicaNotAlive = replica.getCoreUrl();
+            replicaState = state;
+            &lt;span class=&quot;code-keyword&quot;&gt;break&lt;/span&gt;;
+          }
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Should probably restore interrupt status and throw a SolrException.
&lt;div class=&quot;code panel&quot; style=&quot;border-width: 1px;&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;codeContent panelContent&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;code-java&quot;&gt;+      &lt;span class=&quot;code-keyword&quot;&gt;try&lt;/span&gt; {
+        &lt;span class=&quot;code-object&quot;&gt;Thread&lt;/span&gt;.sleep(1000);
+      } &lt;span class=&quot;code-keyword&quot;&gt;catch&lt;/span&gt; (InterruptedException e) {
+        &lt;span class=&quot;code-object&quot;&gt;Thread&lt;/span&gt;.currentThread().interrupt();
+      }
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;I&apos;m not sure the return message is quite right. If a nodes state is not ACTIVE, it does not mean it&apos;s not Live. It can be DOWN and live or RECOVERING and Live, etc. A replica is either Live or not and then has a Live State if and only if it is Live.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Needs some tests.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

I made a patch with all fixes except for tests. Can you give me some suggestion about how to design test for it? I can add a verification in CollectionsAPIDistributedZkTest.createCollection()  to replace waitForRecoveriesToFinish(). But to test the patch completely, it seems to me that it requires injection of delays or failure in core creation which I didn&apos;t find a good way to do. &lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="15098194" author="markrmiller@gmail.com" created="Thu, 14 Jan 2016 14:47:33 +0000"  >&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;requires injection of delays or failure in core creation which I didn&apos;t find a good way to do&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This has been lacking in our test framework for a long time for a variety of reasons. I recently started working on something to inject faults though - we have to have it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Take a look at &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/apache/lucene-solr/blob/trunk/solr/core/src/java/org/apache/solr/util/TestInjection.java&quot; class=&quot;external-link&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;https://github.com/apache/lucene-solr/blob/trunk/solr/core/src/java/org/apache/solr/util/TestInjection.java&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We should use it carefully, and in the right places, but I think testing collection creation fail cases fits the bill.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We use assertions to call the fault injection methods so that they cannot be called by mistake in production (Solr tests require assertions are on, and we don&apos;t properly support running with assertions on in production).&lt;/p&gt;</comment>

I can use it as an example.

Basically it extends the TestInjection.java to inject delay.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The patch also clean up the code for configurations, exceptions and error messages.&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&apos;d still like to look at not waiting for replicas we know failed creating, but it&apos;s a little tricky.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is my current progress attached.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="15139001" author="markrmiller@gmail.com" created="Tue, 9 Feb 2016 14:38:36 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;Another patch, I think this is almost ready. I punted for now on making it not wait for specific failures (there are some annoying complications around error reporting atm), but I made some other improvements.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="15141508" author="michael.sun" created="Wed, 10 Feb 2016 19:37:52 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;Ah yes, it makes sense to skip waiting for replicas to be alive for async calls or in case there is failure. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One question, it uses both rsp.getException() and response.getResponse().get(&quot;exception&quot;). Are they pointing to the same exception? Thanks.&lt;/p&gt;

                            <comment id="15141566" author="markrmiller@gmail.com" created="Wed, 10 Feb 2016 20:08:32 +0000"  >&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Are they pointing to the same exception? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;rsp.getException happens when the response is not code 200 okay - but the collections API works a little different in that sometimes it will put failures and exceptions in a call that returns 200 okay. We just check both cases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also there seems a typo error that return is not included.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not waiting for individual replicas that did not create is left as a TODO there, we don&apos;t want to do anything yet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also moved the waiting code to the CollectionsHandler. I think it&apos;s more efficient and &apos;safer&apos; to pull the waiting out of the Overseer processing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think we can commit this as a good start and use further JIRA&apos;s to make any improvements.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
