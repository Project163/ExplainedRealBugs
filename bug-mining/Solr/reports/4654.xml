            <title>[SOLR-15249] Zookeeper ACL on /security.json</title>
                <link>https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SOLR-15249</link>
                <project id="12310230" key="SOLR">Solr</project>
                    <description>&lt;p&gt;Found a couple of issues around the ACL on &lt;tt&gt;/security.json&lt;/tt&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, the ref guide suggests using &lt;tt&gt;zkcli.sh&lt;/tt&gt; to bootstrap the security.json file before launching Solr. However, if users don&apos;t know to go uncomment the &lt;tt&gt;SOLR_ZK_CREDS_AND_ACLS&lt;/tt&gt; setting in that file, then the &lt;tt&gt;/security.json&lt;/tt&gt; znode gets created with:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;code panel&quot; style=&quot;border-width: 1px;&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;codeContent panelContent&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;code-java&quot;&gt;
[zk: localhost:2181(CONNECTED) 0] getAcl /security.json
&lt;span class=&quot;code-quote&quot;&gt;&apos;world,&apos;&lt;/span&gt;anyone
: cdrwa
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my opinion, Solr should set the proper ACL on &lt;tt&gt;/security.json&lt;/tt&gt; during startup. I can&apos;t think of a valid use-case where someone would not want an ACL set on that file and leave it wide-open?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second issue is the read-only user, set by &lt;tt&gt;-DzkDigestReadonlyUsername=readonly-user&lt;/tt&gt; when using &lt;tt&gt;-DzkCredentialsProvider=org.apache.solr.common.cloud.VMParamsSingleSetCredentialsDigestZkCredentialsProvider&lt;/tt&gt; has read access to this file! I don&apos;t think the readonly-user should get access to &lt;tt&gt;/security.json&lt;/tt&gt; at all. It should not be needed on the SolrJ side (if so that&apos;s a bug too). Here&apos;s an example of the ACL setup on the /security.json:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;code panel&quot; style=&quot;border-width: 1px;&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;codeContent panelContent&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;code-java&quot;&gt;
[zk: localhost:2181(CONNECTED) 3] addauth digest readonly-user:????
[zk: localhost:2181(CONNECTED) 4] getAcl /security.json
&lt;span class=&quot;code-quote&quot;&gt;&apos;digest,&apos;&lt;/span&gt;admin-user:JXWohwvivCNkIt0wF610qwy12m8=
: cdrwa
&lt;span class=&quot;code-quote&quot;&gt;&apos;digest,&apos;&lt;/span&gt;readonly-user:gTm65v03y9NNDb/kShjqJVYk+AI=
: r
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can&apos;t speak to how vulnerable the hashed passwords stored in security.json are (I suspect the are reasonably safe from brute-force cracking but the algo Solr uses is not computationally slow like bcrypt so there may be some risk here). Even if the risk is low, seems like bad form to me and we should protect security.json from users with read-only access, i.e. SolrJ client applications.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

                            <comment id="17299720" author="mdrob" created="Thu, 11 Mar 2021 17:04:00 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;The hashed passwords are only relevant to basic authentication, right? anything that uses a third party provider like kerberos wouldn&apos;t have that type of information exposed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The algo we use is sha256 with 32 bytes of salt - to my knowledge there&apos;s no computationally feasible presage attack on this yet, but hardware keeps getting better and computing sha256 hashes quickly is of particular interest to bitcoin miners so there will likely be spill-over into other aspects of security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&apos;m confused on how the read only user has access to this file, since it looks like SecurityAwareZkACLProvider should be doing the right thing. Does this bug extend to other implementations, like with Sasl authn?&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="17299727" author="thelabdude" created="Thu, 11 Mar 2021 17:13:29 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;&lt;tt&gt;SecurityAwareZkACLProvider&lt;/tt&gt; doesn&apos;t seem to identify &lt;tt&gt;/security.json&lt;/tt&gt; as a security file:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;code panel&quot; style=&quot;border-width: 1px;&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;codeContent panelContent&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;code-java&quot;&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;code-keyword&quot;&gt;protected&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;code-object&quot;&gt;boolean&lt;/span&gt; isSecurityZNodePath(&lt;span class=&quot;code-object&quot;&gt;String&lt;/span&gt; zNodePath) {
    &lt;span class=&quot;code-keyword&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; (zNodePath != &lt;span class=&quot;code-keyword&quot;&gt;null&lt;/span&gt;
        &amp;amp;&amp;amp; (zNodePath.equals(SECURITY_ZNODE_PATH) || zNodePath.startsWith(SECURITY_ZNODE_PATH + &lt;span class=&quot;code-quote&quot;&gt;&quot;/&quot;&lt;/span&gt;))) {
      &lt;span class=&quot;code-keyword&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;code-keyword&quot;&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;;
    }
    &lt;span class=&quot;code-keyword&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;code-keyword&quot;&gt;false&lt;/span&gt;;
  }
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps &lt;tt&gt;/security.json&lt;/tt&gt; started out as &lt;tt&gt;/security&lt;/tt&gt; and then was later changed?&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="17299791" author="mdrob" created="Thu, 11 Mar 2021 18:17:42 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;That&apos;s pretty subtle and I missed that we check for &lt;tt&gt;startsWith(&quot;security/&quot;)&lt;/tt&gt; - if we didn&apos;t have that extra slash then it probably would have worked fine.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="17299947" author="janhoy" created="Fri, 12 Mar 2021 00:25:08 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;We should deprecate SolrJ&apos;s ZK connection from clients. ZK should be protected inside the cluster and with SSL. Exposing ZK connection to clients is a security risk in itself - many many clusters do not even add ZK ACL, so anyone on the outside can go ad delete /security.json and then break into the system.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="17300740" author="dsmiley" created="Sat, 13 Mar 2021 06:36:50 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;Agreed Jan; and it exposes inner details that complicate upgrades (SolrJ reaching into ZK making assumption as to what is where that we don&apos;t want to support).  I&apos;m concerned about this very matter in another issue pertaining to moving where the configName (configSet) is specified for a collection.  There are also a number of extra dependencies.  However, there are some performance gotchas reported to JIRA about HttpClusterStateProvider in the last 6 months, so I&apos;m not quite sure to recommend it yet.  FWIW my team may be looking at those in the months ahead.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="17301727" author="mdrob" created="Mon, 15 Mar 2021 16:03:03 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;I think both approaches can be correct - we can try to make the HttpClusterState the default &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; properly secure the contents of ZK.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&apos;m working on a solution to the latter, but also ran into a Locale issue with Kerberos Tests while checking out the Sasl version. Slight delays, but expect to have this addressed soon.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="17303615" author="mdrob" created="Wed, 17 Mar 2021 17:37:03 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;Attaching a patch that applies to 9x&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not sure if we need to look at back porting to 8x, or if we would consider this needing an 8.8.3 security release. If not, then we can switch the issue to public and continue review in the normal manner.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="17304966" author="mdrob" created="Fri, 19 Mar 2021 15:19:40 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/ViewProfile.jspa?name=janhoy&quot; class=&quot;user-hover&quot; rel=&quot;janhoy&quot;&gt;janhoy&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/ViewProfile.jspa?name=dsmiley&quot; class=&quot;user-hover&quot; rel=&quot;dsmiley&quot;&gt;dsmiley&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/ViewProfile.jspa?name=thelabdude&quot; class=&quot;user-hover&quot; rel=&quot;thelabdude&quot;&gt;thelabdude&lt;/a&gt; - can anybody give this a review? I&apos;m moderately concerned that we weren&apos;t setting any ACLs on security.json allowing anybody with access the ability to overwrite the contents and potentially take over the cluster.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="17305059" author="thelabdude" created="Fri, 19 Mar 2021 17:20:36 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;+1 I think this looks great Mike and like the solution of warning the user if /security.json is not protected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only question I have about this is if the user enables ZK ACLs in &lt;tt&gt;scripts/cloud-scripts/zkcli.sh&lt;/tt&gt; by uncommenting what&apos;s in that file:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;code panel&quot; style=&quot;border-width: 1px;&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;codeContent panelContent&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;code-java&quot;&gt;
#SOLR_ZK_CREDS_AND_ACLS=&quot;-DzkACLProvider=org.apache.solr.common.cloud.VMParamsAllAndReadonlyDigestZkACLProvider \
#  -DzkCredentialsProvider=org.apache.solr.common.cloud.VMParamsSingleSetCredentialsDigestZkCredentialsProvider \
#  -DzkDigestUsername=admin-user -DzkDigestPassword=CHANGEME-ADMIN-PASSWORD \
#  -DzkDigestReadonlyUsername=readonly-user -DzkDigestReadonlyPassword=CHANGEME-READONLY-PASSWORD&quot;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then the &lt;tt&gt;/security.json&lt;/tt&gt; created by &lt;tt&gt;zkcli.sh&lt;/tt&gt; will have an ACL that allows it to be read. What we really want is for the ACL on &lt;tt&gt;/security.json&lt;/tt&gt; to not have read access by anyone but the admin user. So maybe we should also remove the &lt;tt&gt;-DzkDigestReadonlyUsername=readonly-user -DzkDigestReadonlyPassword=CHANGEME-READONLY-PASSWORD&lt;/tt&gt; from that file and put a comment about not allowing the read-only user to have read access to the &lt;tt&gt;/security.json&lt;/tt&gt; file.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Basically, when &lt;tt&gt;/security.json&lt;/tt&gt; gets bootstrapped using &lt;tt&gt;zkcli.sh&lt;/tt&gt;, then the fix you added to &lt;tt&gt;SecurityAwareZkACLProvider&lt;/tt&gt; is bypassed anyway.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="17306478" author="mdrob" created="Mon, 22 Mar 2021 18:19:28 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;I don&apos;t understand your comment, Tim. Running zkcli.sh eventually calls out to Java code, and I verified that it properly sets only the admin user ACLs on security.json.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a separate trap here, that zkcli will not read the values from solr.in.sh so the ZK_CREDS variable has to be set in both places, which I will call out in the docs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Can you confirm that you were testing with my patch applied? Because before my patch, you are definitely right that zkcli.sh would not correctly set the ACLs. &lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="17306485" author="thelabdude" created="Mon, 22 Mar 2021 18:26:30 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;oh ok, we&apos;re good then. I didn&apos;t realize zkcli.sh was hitting that Java code&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="17306492" author="mdrob" created="Mon, 22 Mar 2021 18:39:37 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;Additional updates to the ref guide in the second patch, to be applied on top of the initial patch.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="17307906" author="mdrob" created="Wed, 24 Mar 2021 15:14:42 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;I do not believe this is CVE worthy since the exposed risk is that a file is readable but the information should not be exploitable. The risk of the file being writable is only if users do not follow the already documented instructions, at which point there&apos;s not much more we could do.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="17307930" author="thelabdude" created="Wed, 24 Mar 2021 15:29:56 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;Another thing I realized here is the salt key is actually exposed in security.json (it&apos;s just a base64 encoding of the random 32 bytes). So we&apos;re not as safe from brute force as I originally thought. It&apos;s true that if you don&apos;t have access to the salt, then cracking the SHA-256 password via brute force is impossible but with the salt (from security.json) does that change things? idk ...&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="17307999" author="mdrob" created="Wed, 24 Mar 2021 16:57:16 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;After further reflection, and asking a security minded colleague for their perspective, I do believe that a CVE is useful here to alert users that the documented instructions may have left them vulnerable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&apos;ll start the process with Apache Security. Do we need to plan for an 8.8.2 because of this?&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="17308002" author="mdrob" created="Wed, 24 Mar 2021 16:59:08 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/ViewProfile.jspa?name=ctargett&quot; class=&quot;user-hover&quot; rel=&quot;ctargett&quot;&gt;ctargett&lt;/a&gt; - the typical release instructions for a bug fix release do not include publishing a new version of the ref guide, however since a significant portion of the issue stems from confusing documentation I think we would want to make a special case for 8.8.2 here. What do you think and how burdensome is the ref guide publication process?&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="17308020" author="ctargett" created="Wed, 24 Mar 2021 17:18:10 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;The instructions on how to update the Ref Guide are in the Ref Guide itself: &lt;a href=&quot;https://solr.apache.org/guide/8_8/how-to-contribute.html#publish-the-final-guide&quot; class=&quot;external-link&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;https://solr.apache.org/guide/8_8/how-to-contribute.html#publish-the-final-guide&lt;/a&gt; with a minor variation from the docs for this case: the &lt;tt&gt;-Dsolr-guide-version&lt;/tt&gt; param in the build instructions would be X.Y.Z (8.8.1, since it&apos;s a .1 release &lt;b&gt;of the Ref Guide&lt;/b&gt;, but if you think anyone actually looks at the footer where the version is published and will get confused, go ahead and use 8.8.2, I don&apos;t really care that much) instead of just X.Y (8.8).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also because it&apos;s branch_8x, Gradle isn&apos;t there, so you would have to have all the right versions of the build dependencies pre-installed on your machine; check the &lt;tt&gt;solr/solr-ref-guide/README.txt&lt;/tt&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>

Attaching patch #3 (applied on top of the other two) for this. Somebody please take a look!&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="17309846" author="mdrob" created="Sat, 27 Mar 2021 03:12:50 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;I think my current solution is too aggressive perhaps. We want the following repairs to be possible:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;world:anyone -&amp;gt; secured&lt;br/&gt;
readonly:read -&amp;gt; readonly:none&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And we do not want to be able to do&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#42; -&amp;gt; world:anyone&lt;br/&gt;
secured -&amp;gt; different secured&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;logging on world:anyone first is probably fine in any case.&lt;br/&gt;
after that, we need some more complex logic here, I&apos;m not seeing a simple way to act in the cases we want but don&apos;t inadvertently downgrade. need to sleep on this and think some more.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
