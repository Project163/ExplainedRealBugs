            <title>[SOLR-2493] SolrQueryParser constantly parse luceneMatchVersion in solrconfig. Large performance hit.</title>
                <link>https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SOLR-2493</link>
                <project id="12310230" key="SOLR">Solr</project>
                    <description>&lt;p&gt;I&apos; m putting this as blocker as I think this is a serious issue that should be adressed asap with a release. With the current code this is no way near suitable for production use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For each instance created SolrQueryParser calls&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;getSchema().getSolrConfig().getLuceneVersion(&quot;luceneMatchVersion&quot;, Version.LUCENE_24)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;instead of using&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;getSchema().getSolrConfig().luceneMatchVersion&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This creates a massive performance hit. For each request, there is generally 3 query parsers created and each of them will parse the xml node in config which involve creating an instance of XPath and behind the scene the usual factory finder pattern quicks in within the xml parser and does a loadClass.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The stack is typically:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;   at org.mortbay.jetty.webapp.WebAppClassLoader.loadClass(WebAppClassLoader.java:363)&lt;br/&gt;
       at com.sun.org.apache.xml.internal.dtm.ObjectFactory.findProviderClass(ObjectFactory.java:506)&lt;br/&gt;

       at com.sun.org.apache.xpath.internal.jaxp.XPathImpl.evaluate(XPathImpl.java:275)&lt;br/&gt;
       at org.apache.solr.core.Config.getNode(Config.java:230)&lt;br/&gt;
       at org.apache.solr.core.Config.getVal(Config.java:256)&lt;br/&gt;
       at org.apache.solr.core.Config.getLuceneVersion(Config.java:325)&lt;br/&gt;
       at org.apache.solr.search.SolrQueryParser.&amp;lt;init&amp;gt;(SolrQueryParser.java:76)&lt;br/&gt;
       at org.apache.solr.schema.IndexSchema.getSolrQueryParser(IndexSchema.java:277)&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;With the current 3.1 code, I do barely 250 qps with 16 concurrent users with a near empty index.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Switching SolrQueryParser to use getSchema().getSolrConfig().luceneMatchVersion and doing a quick bench test, performance become reasonable beyond 2000 qps.&lt;/p&gt;

                            <comment id="13028637" author="thetaphi" created="Wed, 4 May 2011 06:40:06 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;This was broken by the commit of &lt;a href=&quot;https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LUCENE-2458&quot; title=&quot;queryparser makes all CJK queries phrase queries regardless of analyzer&quot; class=&quot;issue-link&quot; data-issue-key=&quot;LUCENE-2458&quot;&gt;&lt;del&gt;LUCENE-2458&lt;/del&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Indeed, code should use the already parsed luceneMatchVersion from config (and that was also intended to be used like that from my original luceneMatchVersion patch, see &lt;a href=&quot;https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SOLR-1677&quot; title=&quot;Add support for o.a.lucene.util.Version for BaseTokenizerFactory and BaseTokenFilterFactory&quot; class=&quot;issue-link&quot; data-issue-key=&quot;SOLR-1677&quot;&gt;&lt;del&gt;SOLR-1677&lt;/del&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, but at this time QueryParser was not yet versionified and added later through &lt;a href=&quot;https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LUCENE-2458&quot; title=&quot;queryparser makes all CJK queries phrase queries regardless of analyzer&quot; class=&quot;issue-link&quot; data-issue-key=&quot;LUCENE-2458&quot;&gt;&lt;del&gt;LUCENE-2458&lt;/del&gt;&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think we should fix this by using the public field from SolrConfig, the current code is incorrect. I did not review that when that commit was made.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To prevent such errors, can we make the XML unaccessible after parsing the config initially, so code trying to access XPath later fails?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fix is indeed simple, I will attach patch!&lt;/p&gt;</comment>

&lt;p&gt;this is solr&apos;s fault by having a getter that does some heavy duty xml shit.... I don&apos;t think the issue is fixed until these &quot;getters&quot; that parse xml are removed!!!!!&lt;/p&gt;</comment>

&lt;p&gt;We dont need getters doing parsing available to every component.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="13028943" author="hossman" created="Wed, 4 May 2011 20:35:10 +0000"  >&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;this is solr&apos;s fault by having a getter that does some heavy duty xml shit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;that sounds like some serious buck passing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of the &quot;get&quot; methods on the Config class take in xpath expressions &amp;#8211; it should be obvious to any one who uses them that they are going to do xpath parsing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By the looks of it, the SolrConfig constructor was already creating a public final &quot;luceneMatchVersion&quot; variable in it&apos;s constructor (using the xml parsing based COnfig method) it just wasn&apos;t getting used by the query parser.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In my opinion, the correct way to solve this is to make all methods in o.a.solr.core.Config protected as they should only be called by subclasses doing the actual parsing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&apos;t see how that would inherently protect us from this kind of mistake.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The cause of the problem came from needing public access to a &quot;getLuceneVersion&quot; type method on SolrConfig (which is a subclass of Config)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;even if all the methods in COnfig were protected, that could have very easily wound up being implemented like so ...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;code panel&quot; style=&quot;border-width: 1px;&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;codeContent panelContent&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;code-java&quot;&gt;  &lt;span class=&quot;code-keyword&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; Version getLuceneVersion() { &lt;span class=&quot;code-keyword&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;code-keyword&quot;&gt;super&lt;/span&gt;.inefficientProtectedMethod(...) }
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;...and we would have had the same problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bottom line: we just need to be careful about how/when the Config XML parsing methods are used (protected or otherwise)&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="13028954" author="rcmuir" created="Wed, 4 May 2011 20:46:54 +0000"  >&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of the &quot;get&quot; methods on the Config class take in xpath expressions &#8211; it should be obvious to any one who uses them that they are going to do xpath parsing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How is that obvious? There&apos;s definitely no javadoc saying this. In general, if you have an api that contains XYZ and you add a getXYZ() with absolutely no javadocs that behaves as more than a getter, thats a trap.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I still agree with Uwe, it should be protected to prevent problems, also it would be nice if these methods were called *parse*XYZ() instead of *get*XYZ().&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Otherwise this is going to continue to happen!&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="13028974" author="sbailliez" created="Wed, 4 May 2011 21:27:43 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;The problem is hardly about naming here, it is about correctly using classes when offered the choice. Mistake was made. That&apos;s it. We expect committers to be sufficiently knowledgeable about the codebase when committing code. That&apos;s true anywhere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can hardly expect a service ItemService to have methods such as:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;getItemFromDatabase() or getItemFromServerOnTheOtherSideOfThePlanet() or getItemFromFile() or getItemFromMemory() if there are 4 different implementations of it., you have getItem() and the 4 different implementation do something different internally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I rather actually wonder why the config is not parsed entirely at startup rather than have nodes lying around and cherry-picked.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="13028975" author="thetaphi" created="Wed, 4 May 2011 21:27:51 +0000"  >&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The cause of the problem came from needing public access to a &quot;getLuceneVersion&quot; type method on SolrConfig (which is a subclass of Config)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is not true. getLuceneVersion is in Config not SolrConfig and its public like all the other getXxx() methods. Version is just a datatype like int/float/String. Thats all. It does not need to be public (like all other getters in Config class).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In general the bad thing about the whole config stuff in solr is mixing parsing and value holder. This should theoretically separate classes. So SolrConfig has no parse methods at all. In its ctor it would simply instantiate the ConfigParser (name the class like that) and use it to set the values in SolrConfig. That would be cotrrect design.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The good thing with this design: One could instantiate a SolrConfig and populate it programmatically or via a JSON parser or whatever.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="13028980" author="thetaphi" created="Wed, 4 May 2011 21:34:07 +0000"  >&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I rather actually wonder why the config is not parsed entirely at startup rather than have nodes lying around and cherry-picked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is mostly and should. The problem here is as noted before: SolrConfig subclasses Config which is only for parsing. SolrConfig should simply sublass Object and simply instantiate a parser on ctor to parse and store all parsed content in itsself. After that the parser is useless and can be freed. This would even free the DTM/DOM staying alive until Solr shuts down.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="13028986" author="yseeley@gmail.com" created="Wed, 4 May 2011 21:39:05 +0000"  >&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;How is that obvious?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The signature of these methods might be a tip-off:&lt;br/&gt;
 public double getDouble(String path, double def)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One can&apos;t be passing a String and have no idea what the string is used for &lt;img class=&quot;emoticon&quot; src=&quot;https://issues.apache.org/jira/images/icons/emoticons/wink.png&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; width=&quot;16&quot; align=&quot;absmiddle&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</comment>

&lt;p&gt;The discussion here is just about how to prevent this. For me as a non-Solr comitter, when I did this code with Robert last year, I was also really confused about the design of Config (and in my opinion this is a wrong design). We should maybe open another issue and separate parsing and value-holding in two spearate classes (SolrConfig and ConfigParser). If we would do this all is solved (see above).&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="13029003" author="ryantxu" created="Wed, 4 May 2011 22:03:40 +0000"  >&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was also really confused about the design of Config (and in my opinion this is a wrong design)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like many things in solr/lucene the current design is the product many incremental back-compatible changes &amp;#8211; not a top down view of what it should be.  I would love to use 4.0 as a chance to revisit configs and their relationship to xml/validation etc, but that is a load of work with very little glory...&lt;/p&gt;

                            <comment id="13029018" author="thetaphi" created="Wed, 4 May 2011 22:34:13 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;Ryan: I agree, this is why I always bring this up. With 4.0 we can reimplement APIs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other hand: I thought Solr&apos;s backwards policy is about public HTTP-REST-APIs, why care on implementation details behind, why do we need to keep backwards? This is just a dumb question I never understood. As long as Solr behaves identical to the outside who cares if we change method signatures/class names?&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="13029028" author="ryantxu" created="Wed, 4 May 2011 23:01:04 +0000"  >&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I thought Solr&apos;s backwards policy is about public HTTP-REST-APIs, why care on implementation details behind, why do we need to keep backwards? This is just a dumb question I never understood. As long as Solr behaves identical to the outside who cares if we change method signatures/class names?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, the compatibility priorities are for HTTP-REST APIs, next is probably the external config files &amp;#8211; since changing them may be a hassel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 4.0, we should be able to change the internal method signatures/class names pretty easily.  If changing getDouble() to readDouble() makes things more clear, I&apos;m +1  &amp;#8211; but it still feels like a band-aid, one more incremental improvement.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Long term, i would love to see the custom config system we have replaced with something standard... like spring, or simly POJOs that are loaded (and saved!) via XStream.  This is the bigger pile of work I was referring to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;+1&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think XML is an poor configuration language.  It&apos;s great for one computer to talk to another, but for files that humans may edit, it&apos;s bad &amp;#8211; too much stuff to type for the computer&apos;s benefit, too easy to make a silly mistake.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think something like Yaml is a better choice... this is what ElasticSearch uses, for example.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And, while we&apos;re at it, I think we should make Solr&apos;s error checking brittle on startup: if anything is &quot;off&quot; about the configuration, the server refuses to start (see &lt;a href=&quot;http://markmail.org/thread/ywkfmxjboyixkrjc&quot; class=&quot;external-link&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;http://markmail.org/thread/ywkfmxjboyixkrjc&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;</comment>

&lt;p&gt;@Michael, agree on this. But instead of relying on a monolithic solrconfig.xml file or .yml file, isn&apos;t it better to re-design configuration to fit a path/node concept more fine-grained (like ZK nodes)? It doesn&apos;t feel quite right to store solrconfig.xml and schema.xml as a huge string in the SolrCloud ZK schema. It would be better to have stuff like /solr/configs/configA/general/abortOnConfigurationError=false as a separate config node. Likewise /solr/configs/configA/schema/types/text_en to define fieldType text_en. The config concept won&apos;t need to be bound to ZK either. There could be pluggable backend implementations, where one could read/write the existing XML formats.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
