            <title>[SOLR-7858] Make Angular UI default</title>
                <link>https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SOLR-7858</link>
                <project id="12310230" key="SOLR">Solr</project>
                    <description>&lt;p&gt;Angular UI is very close to feature complete. Once &lt;a href=&quot;https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SOLR-7856&quot; title=&quot;Tidy up exception handling in AngularJS UI&quot; class=&quot;issue-link&quot; data-issue-key=&quot;SOLR-7856&quot;&gt;&lt;del&gt;SOLR-7856&lt;/del&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is dealt with, it should function well in most cases. I propose that, as soon as 5.3 has been released, we make the Angular UI default, ready for the 5.4 release. We can then fix any more bugs as they are found, but more importantly start working on the features that were the reason for doing this work in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

                            <comment id="14743281" author="upayavira" created="Mon, 14 Sep 2015 09:50:32 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;I&apos;m pretty much ready to switch to the Angular UI for 5.4. With the attached patch, I&apos;ll add links between the old and new UIs in case people find issues in the new one. I&apos;ve added an &lt;img class=&quot;emoticon&quot; src=&quot;https://issues.apache.org/jira/images/icons/emoticons/information.png&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; width=&quot;16&quot; align=&quot;absmiddle&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot;/&gt; information link that will, I&apos;m planning, link to a wiki page (not confluence) describing the change between them, asking for people to report issues in the new one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am also planning that &lt;a href=&quot;https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SOLR-4388&quot; title=&quot;Admin UI - SolrCloud - expose Collections API&quot; class=&quot;issue-link&quot; data-issue-key=&quot;SOLR-4388&quot;&gt;&lt;del&gt;SOLR-4388&lt;/del&gt;&lt;/a&gt; be completed for 5.4, at least a first pass.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&apos;d appreciate a few votes for this ticket - to tell me that some people have actually played with the new UI rather than just liking the idea!!&lt;/p&gt;</comment>

Are you able to repeat them here? (in terms of which URLs are used, and for what).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My proposal would be to leave the current UI as index.html, and have /solr/ point at it, and then move admin.html to original.html, such that /solr/original.html will point to the old UI.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>

The number of times that I&apos;ve seen this on the mailing list and the IRC channel is an indication that the users are being easily confused.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having something like &quot;admin#&quot; or &quot;admin/#/&quot; (whatever makes sense for the code) in the URL would likely eliminate that confusion for most people.  Even &quot;index.html&quot; in the URL (which the new UI has now) would be helpful, but using the word &quot;admin&quot; in some way would be better.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chris Hostetter I recall you had suggestions as to how we go about releasing the new UI, but I haven&apos;t been able to track them down. ...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/lucene-dev/201504.mbox/%3Calpine.DEB.2.02.1504301121010.19000@frisbee%3E&quot; class=&quot;external-link&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;http://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/lucene-dev/201504.mbox/%3Calpine.DEB.2.02.1504301121010.19000@frisbee%3E&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My suggestion, along the lines of what we did with the previous UI &lt;br/&gt;
change...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1) ensure that the new UI is fully functional in 5x using an alt path &lt;br/&gt;
(believe this is already true?)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2) add an &quot;Upgrading&quot; note to CHANGES.txt for 5.2 directing people to &lt;br/&gt;
the new &quot;experimental&quot; UI and the URL to access it, note that it &lt;br/&gt;
will likely become the default in 5.3 and users are encouraged to try it &lt;br/&gt;
out and file bugs if they notice any problems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3) update trunk so that it &lt;b&gt;is&lt;/b&gt; the default UI, and make the old UI &lt;br/&gt;
available at some alternate path (eg &quot;/solr/old_ui&quot;).  Add an Upgrading &lt;br/&gt;
note pointing out that the URLs may be slightly different, and how to &lt;br/&gt;
access the old UI if they have problems&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;backport trunk changes (#3) to 5x for 5.3 (or later if problems/delays&lt;br/&gt;
pop up)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And: &lt;a href=&quot;http://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/lucene-dev/201504.mbox/%3Calpine.DEB.2.02.1504301414460.19000@frisbee%3E&quot; class=&quot;external-link&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;http://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/lucene-dev/201504.mbox/%3Calpine.DEB.2.02.1504301414460.19000@frisbee%3E&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;...&lt;br/&gt;
We might want to tweak those URLs slightly to be a little less confusing &lt;br/&gt;
... ie &quot;old.html&quot; and &quot;new.html&quot; (at least until after 5.3) ... i mean, i &lt;br/&gt;
just the paragraph you rwote above, but w/o looking at it i&apos;ve already &lt;br/&gt;
forgoten if &quot;index.html&quot; is hte new one or hte old one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So imagine if a 5.2 user has in their browser...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;	&lt;a href=&quot;http://localhost:8983/solr/admin.html#/collection1&quot; class=&quot;external-link&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;http://localhost:8983/solr/admin.html#/collection1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;...and is trying to remember if this is the new one (that they should get &lt;br/&gt;
use to / help test) or the fuly qualified name of the old one that is &lt;br/&gt;
going away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Likewise imagine if a 5.42 user sees the same URL, and reads a note that &lt;br/&gt;
the &quot;old UI&quot; is going to be removed in 6.0 and is trying to figure out if &lt;br/&gt;
that affects him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few followup comments...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;a) that &quot;step 3&quot; above (changing hte defualt on trunk first) is &lt;b&gt;really&lt;/b&gt; important ... you want that change to sit on trunk for a good while, so that devs working on trunk and manually testing things are &lt;b&gt;using&lt;/b&gt; the new UI anytime they run stuff on trunk, and helping to find problems &amp;#8211; even if no users &quot;try&quot; the new UI in the released versions of Solr&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;b) not sure why i didn&apos;t mention it before, but adding a generic header to all of the &quot;old&quot; UI pages warning people that they are using the old UI and here is a link to the new UI is something that should definitely be added once the default is changed (it could be added even before the default is changed with ome wording tweaks: &quot;Please try the new UI..&quot; vs &quot;You are looking at the old deprecated UI, please switch to....&quot;) to help reduce the # of bug reports / feature requests we get about the old UI and to reduce user frustration (ie; they see in some future release notes that there is a new collection admin screen, but they can&apos;t find it when they load &quot;the admin UI&quot; bookmark they have.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Having something like &quot;admin#&quot; or &quot;admin/#/&quot; (whatever makes sense for the code) in the URL would likely eliminate that confusion for most people. Even &quot;index.html&quot; in the URL (which the new UI has now) would be helpful, but using the word &quot;admin&quot; in some way would be better.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the long term, I don&apos;t know if this is will actually help things or decrease novice user confusion (the URLs, when loaded in a browser, is already clearly a UI, will making the UI urls longer really help people notice &quot;oh hey, maybe this UI based URL isn&apos;t a URL that programtic client code should talk to&quot; ?)  but if this approach is taken it should be &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; carefully considered in terms of how it impacts &quot;reserved words&quot; for things like collection names.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&apos;s annoying enough if we (in the short term) have reserved paths like &quot;/old.ui.html&quot; but if you try to use &quot;/admin&quot; as a prefix to indicate that it&apos;s for the UI, you&apos;ll probably break things like /admin/cores and /admin/collections &amp;#8211; let alone the long term impacts of saying something like &quot;You can&apos;t have a collection named &apos;ui&apos; because of the &apos;/ui&apos;.&quot; etc...&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="14902247" author="upayavira" created="Tue, 22 Sep 2015 08:51:38 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;Thanks &lt;a href=&quot;https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/ViewProfile.jspa?name=hossman_lucene%40fucit.org&quot; class=&quot;user-hover&quot; rel=&quot;hossman_lucene@fucit.org&quot;&gt;hossman_lucene@fucit.org&lt;/a&gt; for your rich perspective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Firstly, to answer your question: yes, the new UI has been in trunk/5x since 5.2. As to whether it has been functional, there are a lot less bugs than there were, although you are right to observe that it needs usage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;= o =&lt;br/&gt;
URLs:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In your comments you were concerned about how a user would be able to find out which UI they are using and what the purpose of the change is. I&apos;ve added links at the top right of the old, and new UIs to switch between them, and a &lt;img class=&quot;emoticon&quot; src=&quot;https://issues.apache.org/jira/images/icons/emoticons/help_16.png&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; width=&quot;16&quot; align=&quot;absmiddle&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot;/&gt; link that points to a wiki page explaining further. I hope this does sufficient in terms of messaging - although your suggestion of a banner saying &quot;this is the old UI, go try the new one--&amp;gt;&quot; seems like a good idea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Personally, I&apos;d support a redirect from &lt;a href=&quot;http://localhost:8983/&quot; class=&quot;external-link&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;http://localhost:8983/&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://localhost:8983/solr/&quot; class=&quot;external-link&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;http://localhost:8983/solr/&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=&quot;http://localhost:8983/solr/admin/&quot; class=&quot;external-link&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;http://localhost:8983/solr/admin/&lt;/a&gt; and host the entire UI there. You mention the risk of URL overlap, but we already have that issue, in more dangerous ways, with files in the UI using the URL space that end-users access. At least if we switched to /admin/, we would only be in conflict with ourselves, in which case it is infinitely more manageable. And, it is already pretty much a given that &apos;admin&apos; wouldn&apos;t work as a collection name.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would, however, suggest we keep this for trunk/6.0. As a code change, it is small. As a usability one, it is much bigger.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;= o =&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Based upon your suggestions, my release proposal and schedule would be:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;5x already has links between old/new UIs so users of 5.4 will be able to get to the new one easily&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;There is also a ? link that points to a wiki page explaining the change and asking for bug reports&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Add a banner saying &quot;go try the new UI&quot; on the old one, both in trunk and 5x&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Change URLs in trunk straight away so that the new UI is the default (old one as /original-ui.html)&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Add a note in CHANGES.txt for 5.4 stating clearly that it will become default in 5.5.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Assuming no major clangers, for 5.5, change the URLs to make the new default (old one is /original-ui.html)&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;For trunk, change the UI to serve from /admin/. Files remain in the same location.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

The UI is something that could live in a special dir such as &lt;tt&gt;/solr/_admin/index.html&lt;/tt&gt; or &lt;tt&gt;/solr/_ui/index.html&lt;/tt&gt;. All the other files also must move out of the top level . For instance, js , css and images also move under the path &lt;tt&gt;/solr/_admin/&lt;/tt&gt; or &lt;tt&gt;/solr/_ui/&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We should make these changes in 5x itself and keep redirect rules for old-&amp;gt; new. In 6.0 we should get rid of the rules as well&lt;/p&gt;

As I understand it, you and one other have had a private discussion and on the basis of that some public discussion has occurred, without a conclusion as yet. That doesn&apos;t, to me, constitute a community wide agreement that the URL structure will be changing according to your proposal, does it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your suggestion is not that different to what I have already proposed - that everything (css/etc too) live under /admin, along with the admin APIs. The only URL we need to keep consistent is the /solr/ one, which must redirect somewhere sensible, which could be _admin/ or _ui/ or whatever.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>

&lt;p&gt;&quot;we&quot; means Solr project. If a feature is built and committed, it is a part of the project. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;As I understand it, you and one other have had a private discussion and on the basis of that some public discussion has occurred, without a conclusion as yet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aren&apos;t all features built like that? . one developer coming up with a suggestion and then the interested developers would comment/vote on the idea. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;That doesn&apos;t, to me, constitute a community wide agreement that the URL structure will be changing according to your proposal, does it?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The proposal was for v2 APIs . The idea is to have fewer top level names that could conflict with collection names. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What do you mean when you say community wide agreement? I don&apos;t think any feature gets all people to vote for it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Your suggestion is not that different to what I have already proposed - that everything (css/etc too) live under /admin, along with the admin APIs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, we are not suggesting very different things. The reason I prepended an underscore is to avoid conflicts with real collection names. In that aspect &lt;tt&gt;/_admin/&lt;/tt&gt; is better than &lt;tt&gt;admin&lt;/tt&gt; .&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the sort of thing that needs to be tracked down and found before we switch the new UI to the default, as it will severely impact on user experience if we don&apos;t.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>

&lt;p&gt;Firstly, I failed to commit changes to web.xml that were needed, which broke the build.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At least the build is fixed. I will revert the remaining changes soon, and commit them against the correct ticket.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
