This is done similiarly with the PrepareForTest annotation in PowerMockito.\n\nBest,\nDaniel\n","closed_by":{"login":"ekuefler","id":666477,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2NjQ3Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/666477?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ekuefler","html_url":"https://github.com/ekuefler","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ekuefler/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ekuefler/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ekuefler/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ekuefler/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ekuefler/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ekuefler/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ekuefler/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ekuefler/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ekuefler/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google/gwtmockito/issues/23/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google/gwtmockito/issues/23/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
