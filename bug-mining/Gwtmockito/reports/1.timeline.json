What the `@GwtMock` annotation does is instructs the test to return that object whenever anyone calls `GWT.create`, so it doesn't make sense to have multiple GwtMocks for the same type, even with name.\n\nI think you probably just mean to use a normal `@Mock` annotation in this case if you're passing the mocks into your test object (I should probably update the error message to suggest this). If you're creating the widgets with UiBinder you don't have to declare your own mock fields at all. Does this help?\n","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google/gwtmockito/issues/comments/33928764/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"ekuefler","id":666477,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2NjQ3Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/666477?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ekuefler","html_url":"https://github.com/ekuefler","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ekuefler/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ekuefler/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ekuefler/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ekuefler/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ekuefler/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ekuefler/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ekuefler/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ekuefler/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ekuefler/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":90263675,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDkwMjYzNjc1","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google/gwtmockito/issues/events/90263675","actor":{"login":"ekuefler","id":666477,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2NjQ3Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/666477?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ekuefler","html_url":"https://github.com/ekuefler","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ekuefler/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ekuefler/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ekuefler/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ekuefler/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ekuefler/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ekuefler/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ekuefler/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ekuefler/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ekuefler/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"bfee374c88e4675f2a0a73b809611bb3927d8022","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google/gwtmockito/commits/bfee374c88e4675f2a0a73b809611bb3927d8022","created_at":"2014-02-03T07:14:25Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google/gwtmockito/issues/comments/34104664","html_url":"https://github.com/google/gwtmockito/issues/24#issuecomment-34104664","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google/gwtmockito/issues/24","id":34104664,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM0MTA0NjY0","user":{"login":"atamur","id":315072,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxNTA3Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/315072?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/atamur","html_url":"https://github.com/atamur","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/atamur/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/atamur/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/atamur/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/atamur/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/atamur/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/atamur/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/atamur/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/atamur/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/atamur/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-02-04T20:42:27Z","updated_at":"2014-02-04T20:42:27Z","body":"Oh, this whole thing is really confusing (at least to me), because we're mixing together 3 concepts calling all of them \"mocks\":\n1) normal mockito mocks, that you define with @Mock\n2) gwtmockito mocks that happen automagically on GWT.create calls and as can be accessed (but not created?) by @GwtMock\n3) stubs that gwtmockito sometimes inserts (if a FakeProvider is defined)\n\nIn my particular case I originally wanted left and right to be gwtmockito magic mocks.
