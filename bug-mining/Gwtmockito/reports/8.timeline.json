I've been having to add workarounds whenever people run into trouble, so thanks a lot for reporting these.\n\nI've fixed the issue with Anchor and ListBox and uploaded a new snapshot version - can you confirm that this fixes things for you? Are there any other ClassCast problems you're seeing?\n\nA way you can deal with this problem in general is to use UiBinder or dependency injection. If you use \"new\" to create widgets, you'll get real widgets that might have surprising behavior when you try to use them from a unit test. If you create your widgets via UiBinder and @UiField, then GwtMockito will automatically inject them with Mockito mocks that you have full control over. Similarly, you can inject the widgets directly into your class yourself and pass your own mocks in tests. So you might be able to work around some of these problems by restructuring a bit, but please do continue reporting them so I can find and fix them.\n","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google/gwtmockito/issues/comments/47505587/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"ekuefler","id":666477,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2NjQ3Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/666477?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ekuefler","html_url":"https://github.com/ekuefler","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ekuefler/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ekuefler/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ekuefler/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ekuefler/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ekuefler/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ekuefler/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ekuefler/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ekuefler/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ekuefler/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google/gwtmockito/issues/comments/47777351","html_url":"https://github.com/google/gwtmockito/issues/33#issuecomment-47777351","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google/gwtmockito/issues/33","id":47777351,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ3Nzc3MzUx","user":{"login":"DKnight2014","id":7968897,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5Njg4OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7968897?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/DKnight2014","html_url":"https://github.com/DKnight2014","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DKnight2014/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DKnight2014/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DKnight2014/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DKnight2014/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DKnight2014/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DKnight2014/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DKnight2014/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DKnight2014/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DKnight2014/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-07-02T13:45:22Z","updated_at":"2014-07-02T13:45:22Z","body":"hey, thank you so much.
