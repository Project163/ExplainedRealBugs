GwtMockito plugs in its own classloader while running tests [here](https://github.com/google/gwtmockito/blob/master/gwtmockito/src/main/java/com/google/gwtmockito/GwtMockitoTestRunner.java#L105). This is necessary since Mockito creates mocks using the context classloader, and if that's different from the classloader used to load the test there will be conflicts. The GwtMockito classloader is probably using the system classloader as its parent, so if the framework is setting things up via the context classloader it might not be able to find the right classes.\n\nAs a quick experiment, you could try modifying the [GwtMockitoClassLoader constructor](https://github.com/google/gwtmockito/blob/master/gwtmockito/src/main/java/com/google/gwtmockito/GwtMockitoTestRunner.java#L131) to use the context classloader as the parent by adding this line:\n\n``` java\nsuper(Thread.currentThread().getContextClassLoader(), null);\n```\n\nIf that fixes things then we know what the issue is and can probably fix it.\n\nWhat do you mean about invoking the testrunner programmatically? The following seems to work for me:\n\n``` java\nResult result = new JUnitCore().run(GwtMockitoTest.class);\n```\n\nAssuming `GwtMockitoTest` is annotated with `@RunWith(GwtMockitoTestRunner.class)`, this will respect the annotation and use GwtMockito. Are you trying to do something more complex than that?\n","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google/gwtmockito/issues/comments/18802981/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"ekuefler","id":666477,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2NjQ3Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/666477?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ekuefler","html_url":"https://github.com/ekuefler","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ekuefler/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ekuefler/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ekuefler/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ekuefler/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ekuefler/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ekuefler/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ekuefler/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ekuefler/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ekuefler/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google/gwtmockito/issues/comments/18824532","html_url":"https://github.com/google/gwtmockito/issues/5#issuecomment-18824532","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google/gwtmockito/issues/5","id":18824532,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE4ODI0NTMy","user":{"login":"bwolff","id":1532631,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MzI2MzE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1532631?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bwolff","html_url":"https://github.com/bwolff","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bwolff/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bwolff/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bwolff/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bwolff/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bwolff/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bwolff/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bwolff/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bwolff/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bwolff/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2013-06-03T06:52:22Z","updated_at":"2013-06-03T06:52:22Z","body":"Hi Erik,\n\nthanks for the response. I already tried your suggestions by modifying the GwtMockitoClassLoader class. However, the problem is that the [ClassPool instance in the onLoad() method](https://github.com/google/gwtmockito/blob/master/gwtmockito/src/main/java/com/google/gwtmockito/GwtMockitoTestRunner.java#L155) can't load the class. I spent some time with the Javassist API docs to find a way to pass a parent classloader to the ClassPool, but eventually I only found the option of adding a single classpath resource to the ClassPool using the #appendClassPool() method. Just a a test I added the path to my compile test class using this method and then the class was found, but it then failed with another ClassNotFound, so I would have to add every class output folder and library to it, which is not really feasible.\n\nThe short snippet you provided is a good start, but how do you actually run this code? I assume that your system classloader is aware of all your classes (GwtMockitoTest, GwtMockito, etc.)? How would the code behave if you put your test class somewhere else, and resolve it at runtime by using a context classloader, for example?\n\nA mechanism to specify a \"parent classloader\" for the custom GwtMockitoClassLoader would be very nice in order to allow the integration into other frameworks that work with assembling the full classpath at runtime (due to convention over configuration source folders etc.).\n\nI'll try to look more into this when I find the time. Thanks!\n\nCheers,\nBen\n","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google/gwtmockito/issues/comments/18824532/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"bwolff","id":1532631,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MzI2MzE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1532631?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bwolff","html_url":"https://github.com/bwolff","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bwolff/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bwolff/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bwolff/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bwolff/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bwolff/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bwolff/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bwolff/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bwolff/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bwolff/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google/gwtmockito/issues/comments/19161096","html_url":"https://github.com/google/gwtmockito/issues/5#issuecomment-19161096","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google/gwtmockito/issues/5","id":19161096,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE5MTYxMDk2","user":{"login":"ekuefler","id":666477,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2NjQ3Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/666477?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ekuefler","html_url":"https://github.com/ekuefler","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ekuefler/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ekuefler/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ekuefler/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ekuefler/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ekuefler/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ekuefler/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ekuefler/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ekuefler/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ekuefler/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2013-06-09T05:19:04Z","updated_at":"2013-06-09T05:19:04Z","body":"It's a bit hard to provide configuration options to GwtMockitoTestRunner, since the @RunWith annotation doesn't allow you to pass additional arguments.
