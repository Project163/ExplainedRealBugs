My hope with getClassesToStub was that projects would figure out which classes they needed to add and then define their own extension of GwtMockitoTestRunner and use that in all of their tests such that they didn't have to duplicate the classes all over the place. But I agree this is a little cumbersome if you only have a test or two that care about extra stub classes.
