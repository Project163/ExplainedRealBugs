There are classes and interfaces in these packages. These classes and interfaces are considered as API so clients will use them. There are a lot of methods in API that returns instances of private, not API classes or takes them as parameters. This situation prevents clients from using such API methods in a modular environment.\r\n\r\nFor instance:\r\nPackage org.jfree.chart.plot is exported because it contains API.\r\nSo public class org.jfree.chart.plot.SpiderWebPlot is an API.\r\npublic method org.jfree.chart.plot.SpiderWebPlot#getLabelGenerator returns org.jfree.chart.labels.CategoryItemLabelGenerator\r\nBut org.jfree.chart.labels is not considered as an API in module-info.","closed_by":{"login":"jfree","id":1835893,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MzU4OTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1835893?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jfree","html_url":"https://github.com/jfree","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jfree/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jfree/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jfree/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jfree/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jfree/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jfree/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jfree/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jfree/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jfree/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jfree/jfreechart/issues/214/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jfree/jfreechart/issues/214/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
