Snyk, our security scanner, is flagging that our class implements `equals()` but not `hashcode()`.  \r\n\r\nWe would appreciate it if this class and its parents implemented both methods.  \r\n\r\nWe use Lombok which provides a helpful `@EqualsAndHashCode` implementation which generates these methods correctly for you based on the fields of the class.  That may be the easiest way to implement both methods.
