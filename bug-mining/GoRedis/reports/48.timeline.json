Expected Behavior\r\n\r\nWhen using the GCP MemoryStore redis cluster, the credentials only last for about an hour. therefore, the same option added in https://github.com/redis/go-redis/pull/2097 needs to be added to the ClusterOptions and passed through to the underlying NewRedis call's Options object.\r\n\r\n## Current Behavior\r\n\r\nThere is only the static Username and Password options on the ClusterOptions; because of this, cluster clients may only be used for up to an hour and then need to be replaced with a new one.\r\n\r\n## Possible Solution\r\n\r\nAdd and curry/copy the CredentialsProvider option to the NewRedis call. Maybe also provide an option that provides a method that takes a Context and returns error as suggested in https://github.com/redis/go-redis/issues/2681\r\n\r\n## Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\nJust try to invent a way to change the password periodically and see that you can't without getting very deep in the guts with reflection and changing things around.\r\n\r\n## Context (Environment)\r\n\r\nThis is blocking or at least hindering use of this client with GCP MemoryStore redis cluster; possible workaround is to replace the entire client with a frequency more than the expiration duration.\r\n\r\n<!--- Providing context helps us come up with a solution that is most useful in the real world -->\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/redis/go-redis/pull/2097 solved this for redis instance.\r\n\r\n<!--- Provide a general summary of the issue in the Title above -->\r\n\r\n## Detailed Description\r\n\r\n<!--- Provide a detailed description of the change or addition you are proposing -->\r\n\r\n## Possible Implementation\r\n\r\nProvide the same option in the cluster options and ensure that gets to the underlying redis client's Options.\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/redis/go-redis/issues/2888/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/redis/go-redis/issues/2888/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"not_planned"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/redis/go-redis/issues/comments/2128204642","html_url":"https://github.com/redis/go-redis/issues/2681#issuecomment-2128204642","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/redis/go-redis/issues/2681","id":2128204642,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAE8G285-2dNi","user":{"login":"AzureMarker","id":4417660,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0MTc2NjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4417660?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AzureMarker","html_url":"https://github.com/AzureMarker","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AzureMarker/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AzureMarker/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AzureMarker/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AzureMarker/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AzureMarker/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AzureMarker/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AzureMarker/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AzureMarker/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AzureMarker/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-05-23T23:37:49Z","updated_at":"2024-05-23T23:45:52Z","body":"This
