Our redis server is configured with `timeout`, when connections are idle for longer, we get an `EOF` error on the next request. We tried to lower/set the `IdleTimeout` option, but it causes a deadlock.\n\nHow to reproduce:\n1. Start redis-server with `--timeout 5`\n2. `go run` the code snippets below\n\n``` go\npackage main\n\nimport (\n    \"fmt\"\n    redis \"github.com/vmihailenco/redis/v2\"\n    \"time\"\n)\n\nfunc main() {\n    red := redis.NewTCPClient(&redis.Options{Addr: \"localhost:6379\"})\n    for {\n        val := red.Ping()\n        fmt.Println(val)\n        time.Sleep(6 * time.Second)\n    }\n}\n```\n\n``` go\npackage main\n\nimport (\n    \"fmt\"\n    redis \"github.com/vmihailenco/redis/v2\"\n    \"time\"\n)\n\nfunc main() {\n    red := redis.NewTCPClient(&redis.Options{Addr: \"localhost:6379\", IdleTimeout: 3})\n    for {\n        val := red.Ping()\n        fmt.Println(val)\n        time.Sleep(6 * time.Second)\n    }\n}\n```\n","closed_by":{"login":"vmihailenco","id":290976,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5MDk3Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/290976?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vmihailenco","html_url":"https://github.com/vmihailenco","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vmihailenco/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vmihailenco/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vmihailenco/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vmihailenco/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vmihailenco/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vmihailenco/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vmihailenco/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vmihailenco/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vmihailenco/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/redis/go-redis/issues/25/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/redis/go-redis/issues/25/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
