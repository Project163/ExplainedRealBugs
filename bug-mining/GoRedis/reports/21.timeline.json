If I care about some information, I should log it. It's not like you're logging something that I don't have access to. Whenever I use the failover-enabled client, I get some noisy log messages telling me what's the Redis endpoint for a given master name. Logging errors in a library also doesn't make sense, as you're returning then later, so it should be a decision of the calling code whether to log or do something else, specially because you're logging to a shared resource (the global logger). If you have a library-wise logger, that would be fine for me.\n\nSeems like you don't agree with me on this point, which is definitely fine. Having a global Logger would solve the issue as well. Thank you very much for your time.\n","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/redis/go-redis/issues/comments/178768460/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"fsouza","id":108725,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwODcyNQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/108725?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fsouza","html_url":"https://github.com/fsouza","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fsouza/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fsouza/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fsouza/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fsouza/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fsouza/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fsouza/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fsouza/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fsouza/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fsouza/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":536360375,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50NTM2MzYwMzc1","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/redis/go-redis/issues/events/536360375","actor":{"login":"vmihailenco","id":290976,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5MDk3Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/290976?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vmihailenco","html_url":"https://github.com/vmihailenco","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vmihailenco/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vmihailenco/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vmihailenco/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vmihailenco/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vmihailenco/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vmihailenco/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vmihailenco/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vmihailenco/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vmihailenco/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2016-02-02T19:19:55Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":536360376,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDUzNjM2MDM3Ng==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/redis/go-redis/issues/events/536360376","actor":{"login":"vmihailenco","id":290976,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5MDk3Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/290976?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vmihailenco","html_url":"https://github.com/vmihailenco","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vmihailenco/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vmihailenco/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vmihailenco/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vmihailenco/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vmihailenco/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vmihailenco/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vmihailenco/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vmihailenco/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vmihailenco/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2016-02-02T19:19:55Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/redis/go-redis/issues/comments/179216786","html_url":"https://github.com/redis/go-redis/issues/250#issuecomment-179216786","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/redis/go-redis/issues/250","id":179216786,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE3OTIxNjc4Ng==","user":{"login":"fsouza","id":108725,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwODcyNQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/108725?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fsouza","html_url":"https://github.com/fsouza","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fsouza/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fsouza/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fsouza/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fsouza/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fsouza/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fsouza/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fsouza/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fsouza/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fsouza/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-02-03T13:01:57Z","updated_at":"2016-02-03T13:01:57Z","body":"Ahh,
