In my case one of the corresponding hashes is missing one of the fields which causes an error to be thrown (specifically from the isNilReply method which was moved to the readLine in the referenced ticket above)\n\nI'm looking to be able to still return the results with missing fields having an empty string since the redis result will do the same. \n\nie: SORT things1 GET things2:*->somefield GET things2:*->missingfield    \n\n(An empty row is still returned for the missing field)\n\nIs this something that could be addressed? (or since I am new to redis, is there another way to do this?)\n","closed_by":{"login":"vmihailenco","id":290976,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5MDk3Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/290976?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vmihailenco","html_url":"https://github.com/vmihailenco","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vmihailenco/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vmihailenco/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vmihailenco/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vmihailenco/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vmihailenco/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vmihailenco/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vmihailenco/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vmihailenco/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vmihailenco/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/redis/go-redis/issues/246/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/redis/go-redis/issues/246/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
