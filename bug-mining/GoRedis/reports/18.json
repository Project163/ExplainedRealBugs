I initialize the connection like so:\n\n```\nvar (\n    Queues  *redis.Client\n    Tracker *redis.Client\n)\n\nfunc Connect(url string) {\n    // cut away redis://\n    url = url[8:]\n\n    // connect to db #0\n    Queues = redis.NewClient(&redis.Options{\n        Addr:     url,\n        Password: \"\",\n        DB:       0,\n    })\n\n    _, err := Queues.Ping().Result()\n    if err != nil {\n        panic(err)\n    }\n\n    // connect to db #1\n    Tracker = redis.NewClient(&redis.Options{\n        Addr:     url,\n        Password: \"\",\n        DB:       1,\n    })\n\n    _, err = Tracker.Ping().Result()\n    if err != nil {\n        panic(err)\n    }\n}\n```\n\nAbeit in an upcoming patch (sysadmin is deploying a Redis cluster) it will be like so:\n\n```\nvar (\n    Cluster *redis.ClusterClient\n)\n\nfunc ConnectCluster(cluster, password string) {\n    addresses := strings.Split(cluster, \",\")\n    Cluster = redis.NewClusterClient(&redis.ClusterOptions{\n        Addrs: addresses,\n        // Password: password,\n    })\n\n    _, err := Cluster.Ping().Result()\n    if err != nil {\n        panic(err)\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThe above code gets run once when service boots up `in main.go` and the `*redis.ClusterClient` is being used for the lifetime of the process.\n\nI realize there is an iherent problem with this approach, which is manifesting itself in connections timing out after a few days, and crashing the application:\n`redis: connection pool timeout`\n[See logs here](http://i.imgur.com/zlOCV2y.png)\n\nPlease advise, what would be a proper approach to use go-redis in this situation?\n","closed_by":{"login":"vmihailenco","id":290976,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5MDk3Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/290976?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vmihailenco","html_url":"https://github.com/vmihailenco","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vmihailenco/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vmihailenco/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vmihailenco/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vmihailenco/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vmihailenco/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vmihailenco/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vmihailenco/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vmihailenco/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vmihailenco/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/redis/go-redis/issues/195/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/redis/go-redis/issues/195/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
