the problem here is that\r\n\r\n```\r\npubsub := client.Subscribe(...)\r\nerr := client.Publish(...)\r\n```\r\n\r\ndoes not guarantee that `Subscribe` is executed before `Publish`, because go-redis does not read reply from Redis that `Subscribe` succeeded. So I guess that kernel can buffer writes to different connections and deliver them in arbitrary order. So to fix your program you need to write it like this\r\n\r\n```\r\npubsub := client.Subscribe(...)\r\n_, err := pubsub.Receive() // wait for subscription to be created and ignore the message\r\nerr := client.Publish(...)\r\n```\r\n\r\nSuch program always works correctly.\r\n\r\nPS AFAIK other clients have exactly the same
