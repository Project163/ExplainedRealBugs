This includes explicitly configuring the TLS settings for use with `client.DialWithDialerTLS()`, vs using the `client.DialTLS()` wrapper method (both from the `emersion/go-imap` package).\r\n\r\nAs part of this work, I'm setting `tls.Config.MinVersion` to TLS v1.2, vs the default TLS v1.0 value. This resolves a `gosec` warning.\r\n\r\nIdeally this would be user configurable, so I'm filing this issue as a reminder to add this support in the future.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atc0005/check-mail/issues/169/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/atc0005/check-mail/issues/169/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":5089847978,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDUwODk4NDc5Nzg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/redis/go-redis/issues/events/5089847978","actor":{"login":"monkey92t","id":23448594,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzNDQ4NTk0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/23448594?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/monkey92t","html_url":"https://github.com/monkey92t","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/monkey92t/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/monkey92t/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/monkey92t/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/monkey92t/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/monkey92t/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/monkey92t/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/monkey92t/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/monkey92t/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/monkey92t/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"913aba43f9e3451f9d147f2a939c66e61da715b4","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/monkey92t/redis/commits/913aba43f9e3451f9d147f2a939c66e61da715b4","created_at":"2021-07-30T07:10:56Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":5090166386,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDUwOTAxNjYzODY=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/redis/go-redis/issues/events/5090166386","actor":{"login":"monkey92t","id":23448594,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzNDQ4NTk0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/23448594?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/monkey92t","html_url":"https://github.com/monkey92t","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/monkey92t/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/monkey92t/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/monkey92t/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/monkey92t/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/monkey92t/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/monkey92t/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/monkey92t/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/monkey92t/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/monkey92t/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"9d9e290d3fb8c0fff6caa02a860c41685c7d6643","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/monkey92t/redis/commits/9d9e290d3fb8c0fff6caa02a860c41685c7d6643","created_at":"2021-07-30T08:24:19Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"actor":{"login":"monkey92t","id":23448594,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzNDQ4NTk0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/23448594?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/monkey92t","html_url":"https://github.com/monkey92t","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/monkey92t/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/monkey92t/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/monkey92t/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/monkey92t/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/monkey92t/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/monkey92t/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/monkey92t/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/monkey92t/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/monkey92t/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-07-30T08:37:37Z","updated_at":"2021-07-30T08:37:37Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/redis/go-redis/issues/1842","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/redis/go-redis","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/redis/go-redis/issues/1842/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/redis/go-redis/issues/1842/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/redis/go-redis/issues/1842/events","html_url":"https://github.com/redis/go-redis/pull/1842","id":956534380,"node_id":"MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0NzAwMTE0MDQ1","number":1842,"title":"adjust
