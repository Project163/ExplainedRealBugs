(Confidence: HIGH, Severity: HIGH)\r\n\r\n\r\n## Expected Behavior\r\nWhen running inside project the following:\r\n`gosec -quiet -confidence high -severity high ./...`\r\nIt should return 0 issues with high severity and confidence\r\n## Current Behavior\r\nWhen running inside project the following:\r\n`gosec -quiet -confidence high -severity high ./...`\r\nIt returns:\r\n```\r\n[/path/to/repo/redis/options.go:249] - G402 (CWE-295): TLS MinVersion too low.

I personally set the cursor for failure if any issue with HIGH confidence and HIGH severity are found. I was thinking it could impact other people in the same way.\r\n\r\n## Possible implementation:\r\nEither:\r\n1. Disable the check of this line using `// #nosec G402` like they did [here](https://github.com/RedHatInsights/insights-operator-controller/pull/381/files)\r\nOR\r\n2.
