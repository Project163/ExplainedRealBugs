It seems that the connection \"dies\" if unused with err = EOF.\n\nWhat is the suggested mechanism to re-connect transparently and to prevent failure for the failing initial request? Can the library auto-reconnect in case of failed connection?\n\nThe code is super-simple. It does a MGET command for several keys. Redis connection is initialized using:\n\n``` go\nfunc InitRedis(host string, db int64) {\n    client = redis.NewClient(&redis.Options{\n        Network:\"tcp4\",\n        Addr: host,\n        DB: db,\n    })\n}\n\n//request to get\n  v, err := client.MGet(\"cp:\"+date, \"ob:\" + date).Result()\n    if(err!=nil || err == redis.Nil){\n        log.Println(\"Error while getting Redis keys: \", err)\n        panic(err)\n    }\n\n```\n\nThanks,\nRobert\n","closed_by":{"login":"vmihailenco","id":290976,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5MDk3Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/290976?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vmihailenco","html_url":"https://github.com/vmihailenco","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vmihailenco/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vmihailenco/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vmihailenco/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vmihailenco/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vmihailenco/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vmihailenco/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vmihailenco/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vmihailenco/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vmihailenco/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/redis/go-redis/issues/84/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/redis/go-redis/issues/84/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
