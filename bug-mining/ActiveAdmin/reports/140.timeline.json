problem is that #5867 calls input_html_options which uses `Formtastic::Inputs::Base` methods to generate option keys (id, placeholder, maxlength, size, required, autofocus, readonly).\r\nThe result is the duplication of id for both inputs (and other wrong options).\r\nDateRangeInput is special, because for one input it generates two separate inputs (is there any other input, which consists of multiple sub-inputs?). It cannot use default Formtastic options and override DateRangeInput's default options and propagate them to all sub-inputs.\r\nI suggest overriding default options not by calling Formtastic's input_html_options, but by calling `(options[:input_html] || {})`. In this way the programmer still can override options. The missing options are filled by ActionView in render method. E.g. the id is generated from method_name (gt_input_name and lt_input_name respectively) here:
