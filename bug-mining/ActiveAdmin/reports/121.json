Filter search status\r\n\r\nI have filters listed out for a page:\r\n\r\n```\r\nfilter :id\r\nfilter :user_id, label: \"User ID\"\r\nfilter :user_username, as: :string\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut when they're

filters\r\n\r\nPer advice here (https://github.com/activeadmin/activeadmin/issues/2122) I see how to turn off filters:\r\n\r\n/config/initializers/active_admin.rb\r\n```\r\n   config.current_filters = false #or true\r\n```\r\n\r\nI tried following additional advice there and move that to a registered page and it doesn't work on a per-page basis and was informed to create an issue for it.\r\n\r\nDoesn't work:\r\n```\r\nActiveAdmin.register MyModule::MyThing, as: \"MyThing\" do\r\n   config.current_filters = false #or true\r\nend\r\n```\r\n\r\nThanks and keep up the great work!","closed_by":{"login":"timoschilling","id":165599,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NTU5OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/165599?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/timoschilling","html_url":"https://github.com/timoschilling","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timoschilling/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timoschilling/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timoschilling/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timoschilling/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timoschilling/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timoschilling/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timoschilling/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timoschilling/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timoschilling/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/activeadmin/activeadmin/issues/4757/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/activeadmin/activeadmin/issues/4757/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
