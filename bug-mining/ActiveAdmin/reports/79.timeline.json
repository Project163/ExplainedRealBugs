In Firefox, the image (if huge) will make the panel on the left be huge, and the second panel will be offscreen and you need to scroll to see it. To fix this in Firefox, I simply overrode the `#wrapper` to use `display: block;`, and that was enough to make Firefox and Chrome display them the way I expected. I'll be keeping my eye out, but I have yet to see any adverse reactions.\n\nOn this note, I think it would be an interesting exercise to go through the stylings and attempt to standardize things. Especially standardizing colors, making it easier to add different themes to the AA interface. A lot of colors have variables in one place or another, but a lot of others don't, and they probably could.\n","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/activeadmin/activeadmin/issues/comments/26191204/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"shekibobo","id":293858,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5Mzg1OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/293858?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/shekibobo","html_url":"https://github.com/shekibobo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shekibobo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shekibobo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shekibobo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shekibobo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shekibobo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shekibobo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shekibobo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shekibobo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shekibobo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/activeadmin/activeadmin/issues/comments/26204638","html_url":"https://github.com/activeadmin/activeadmin/issues/2553#issuecomment-26204638","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/activeadmin/activeadmin/issues/2553","id":26204638,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2MjA0NjM4","user":{"login":"seanlinsley","id":688886,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4ODg4Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/688886?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanlinsley","html_url":"https://github.com/seanlinsley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanlinsley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanlinsley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanlinsley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanlinsley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanlinsley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanlinsley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanlinsley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanlinsley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanlinsley/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2013-10-12T19:51:11Z","updated_at":"2013-10-12T19:51:11Z","body":"I'm definitely +1 on standardizing AA styles\n\nIt's been two years.
