The resulting output shows that `load!` is called twice.\r\n\r\nI'm also going to send a PR soon that includes a test case.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"javierjulio","id":198547,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5ODU0Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/198547?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/javierjulio","html_url":"https://github.com/javierjulio","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javierjulio/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javierjulio/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javierjulio/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javierjulio/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javierjulio/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javierjulio/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javierjulio/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javierjulio/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/javierjulio/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/activeadmin/activeadmin/issues/5739/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/activeadmin/activeadmin/issues/5739/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
