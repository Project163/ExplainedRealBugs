a resource belongs to parent, duplicate routes are generated for parent, which breaks custom collection actions. Here's an example.\n\n``` ruby\nActiveAdmin.register Store do\n  belongs_to :batch, :optional => true\nend\n\nActiveAdmin.register Batch do\n\n  # show csv import form\n  collection_action :import_csv do\n  end\n\n  # process csv import form\n  collection_action :import_csv_save, :method => :post do\n  end\nend\n```\n\nHere are the routes that are generated in this case: https://gist.github.com/1390730. If you look carefully, you'll notice that `/admin/batches/:id(.:format)` takes precedence over `/admin/batches/import_csv(.:format)` which results in an error when `/admin/batches/import_csv` is hit. The reason for this is the code that the router generates:\n\n``` ruby\n# for batches\nresources :batch\n   # ...\nend\n\n# for stores\nresources :batch\n  resources :store\nend\n```\n\nThe fix seems pretty easy, just add `:only` in `active_admin/router.rb`, line 63:\n\n``` ruby\nresources config.belongs_to_config.target.underscored_resource_name.pluralize, :only => [] do\n  instance_eval &routes_for_belongs_to\nend\n```\n","closed_by":{"login":"gregbell","id":719,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcxOQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/719?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gregbell","html_url":"https://github.com/gregbell","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gregbell/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gregbell/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gregbell/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gregbell/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gregbell/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gregbell/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gregbell/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gregbell/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gregbell/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/activeadmin/activeadmin/issues/782/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/activeadmin/activeadmin/issues/782/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
