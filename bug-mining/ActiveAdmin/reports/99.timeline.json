Before\n\nBefore this PR the index action DSL is quite different and partly very dirty.\n### There are two problems:\n#### 1. actions _with dropdown_ and custom actions has a different mark up than actions _without dropdown_ and custom actions\n\n``` ruby\nactions dropdown: true do |admin_user|\n  item 'Grant Admin', grant_admin_admin_user_path(admin_user)\n  # here you need to use `item`\nend\n\nactions do |admin_user|\n  link_to 'Grant Admin', grant_admin_admin_user_path(admin_user)\n  # here you need to use a string retuning method\nend\n```\n#### 2. If you want to show two custom actions (without dropdown), you need to do a very dirty thing:\n\n``` ruby\nactions do |resource|\n  (link_to \"Foo\", foo_admin_resource_path(resource)) + \" \" +\n  (link_to \"Bar\", bar_admin_resource_path(resource))\nend\n```\n## After\n\nAfter this PR both actions types use the same DSL and you don't need to concat strings to display 2 custom actions\n\n``` ruby\nactions do |resource|\n  item \"Foo\", foo_admin_resource_path(resource)\n  item \"Bar\", bar_admin_resource_path(resource)\nend\n\nactions dropdown: true do |resource|\n  item \"Foo\", foo_admin_resource_path(resource)\n  item \"Bar\", bar_admin_resource_path(resource)\nend\n\n# You can use the arbre too:\nactions dropdown: true do |resource|\n  a \"Foo\", href: foo_admin_resource_path(resource)\n  a \"Bar\", href: bar_admin_resource_path(resource)\nend\n```\n\nNOTE: the old way still works, but should be depreciated\n\nThis PR fix
