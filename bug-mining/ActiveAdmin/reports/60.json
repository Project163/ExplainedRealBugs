Here's my attempt; the question is where should it go in our current docs? Resource Customization? One of the Index docs?\n### Associated Sorting\n\nOn an index page you're normally able to sort columns alphabetically, but by default you can't sort by associated objects. Though with a few simple changes, you can.\n\nAssuming you're on the Books index page, and Book has_one Publisher:\n\n``` ruby\ncontroller do\n  def scoped_collection\n    resource_class.includes(:publisher)\n  end\nend\n```\n\nThen it's simple to sort by any Publisher attribute from within the index table:\n\n``` ruby\nindex do\n  column :publisher, sortable: 'publishers.name'\nend\n```\n","closed_by":{"login":"seanlinsley","id":688886,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4ODg4Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/688886?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanlinsley","html_url":"https://github.com/seanlinsley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanlinsley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanlinsley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanlinsley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanlinsley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanlinsley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanlinsley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanlinsley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanlinsley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanlinsley/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/activeadmin/activeadmin/issues/1977/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/activeadmin/activeadmin/issues/1977/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
