It _is_ a security risk because of the hard-coded password. +1 for Sean's idea of an interactive installer. It should prompt if \n\nHowever, I do question the AdminUser being in a migration file. It seems better suited for a seeds file.\n\nEither way, an experienced ActiveAdmin developer should already be aware of the default user and make changes to the email address and password. Having used ActiveAdmin for countless projects, the default user has not posed an issue for me. It certainly makes it easy to teach ActiveAdmin to noobs.\n","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/activeadmin/activeadmin/issues/comments/127811619/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"scarver2","id":2336088,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMzYwODg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2336088?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/scarver2","html_url":"https://github.com/scarver2","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scarver2/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scarver2/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scarver2/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scarver2/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scarver2/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scarver2/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scarver2/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scarver2/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scarver2/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":384904003,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50Mzg0OTA0MDAz","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/activeadmin/activeadmin/issues/events/384904003","actor":{"login":"timoschilling","id":165599,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NTU5OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/165599?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/timoschilling","html_url":"https://github.com/timoschilling","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timoschilling/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timoschilling/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timoschilling/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timoschilling/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timoschilling/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timoschilling/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timoschilling/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timoschilling/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timoschilling/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":"3fb69f21426a53947bb645170409ca722de7ec15","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/activeadmin/activeadmin/commits/3fb69f21426a53947bb645170409ca722de7ec15","created_at":"2015-08-18T02:36:43Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/activeadmin/activeadmin/issues/comments/132256782","html_url":"https://github.com/activeadmin/activeadmin/issues/3988#issuecomment-132256782","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/activeadmin/activeadmin/issues/3988","id":132256782,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEzMjI1Njc4Mg==","user":{"login":"scarver2","id":2336088,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMzYwODg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2336088?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/scarver2","html_url":"https://github.com/scarver2","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scarver2/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scarver2/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scarver2/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scarver2/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scarver2/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scarver2/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scarver2/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scarver2/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scarver2/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-08-18T15:51:42Z","updated_at":"2015-08-18T15:55:26Z","body":":tada: Works like a champ and removes the security issue that was present in the migration file.
