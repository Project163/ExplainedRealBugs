You have to successfully deploy and run migrations once. So if you _haven't_ done so and have an ActiveAdmin app you'd like to deploy, `user-env-compile` by itself won't save you. _However_, you can manually set the `DATABASE_URL` config var by copying the `HEROKU_POSTGRESQL_COLOR_URL` config var, which _is_ set when you provision the addon. This will let your app connect to the database backend and allow your deployment to succeed.\n> \n> TL;DR:\n> \n> `$ heroku labs:enable user-env-compile`\n> `$ heroku config:add DATABASE_URL=$(heroku config | awk '/HEROKU_POSTGRESQL.*:/ {print $2}')`\n","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/activeadmin/activeadmin/issues/comments/23109359/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"DanielWright","id":642817,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0MjgxNw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/642817?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/DanielWright","html_url":"https://github.com/DanielWright","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DanielWright/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DanielWright/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DanielWright/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DanielWright/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DanielWright/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DanielWright/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DanielWright/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DanielWright/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DanielWright/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/activeadmin/activeadmin/issues/comments/23109493","html_url":"https://github.com/activeadmin/activeadmin/issues/2342#issuecomment-23109493","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/activeadmin/activeadmin/issues/2342","id":23109493,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIzMTA5NDkz","user":{"login":"joallard","id":949482,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk0OTQ4Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/949482?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/joallard","html_url":"https://github.com/joallard","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joallard/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joallard/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joallard/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joallard/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joallard/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joallard/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joallard/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joallard/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joallard/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2013-08-22T17:23:19Z","updated_at":"2013-08-22T17:23:19Z","body":"Correct.
