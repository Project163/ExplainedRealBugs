I'm on the Rails4 branch. In compiling the slug, the app compiles the slug without access to things such as the DB.\n\nHowever, when calling:\n\n```\n# config/routes.rb\nActiveAdmin.routes(self)\n```\n\nIt then opens `app/admin/#{model}.rb` which attempts to connect to the DB. Which should fail.\n\nOn Heroku, this will cause the compilation to fail and the push to be rejected.
