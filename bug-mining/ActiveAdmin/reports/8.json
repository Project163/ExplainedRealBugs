using a model with some scopes involving joins. For example:\n\n```\nclass User < ActiveRecord::Base\n...\n  def self.popular\n    joins('LEFT JOIN followings ON users.id = followings.followee_id').\n    group('users.id').\n    where('COUNT(users.id) > 10')\n  end\n...\nend\n```\n\nIf I add this scope to my ActiveAdmin config, I get the following error when viewing the Users index:\n\n```\nMysql2::Error: Column 'id' in order clause is ambiguous: SELECT COUNT(*) AS count_all, users.id AS users_id FROM `users` LEFT JOIN followings ON users.id = followings.followee_id GROUP BY users.id WHERE COUNT(users.id) > 10 ORDER BY id desc\n```\n\nThis appears to be because in [<code>lib/active_admin.rb</code>](https://github.com/gregbell/active_admin/blob/master/lib/active_admin.rb#L51) the default sort order is set to \"id_desc\", which doesn't then get scoped with the appropriate table name - hence the ambiguous query error.\n\nThere's a gist [here](https://gist.github.com/972217) with the full stack trace in case it's useful...\n\nCheers,\nSimon\n\np.s. thanks for a wonderful tool, by the way - I'm really loving what I've seen of it so far.\n","closed_by":{"login":"pcreux","id":45299,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1Mjk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/45299?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pcreux","html_url":"https://github.com/pcreux","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pcreux/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pcreux/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pcreux/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pcreux/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pcreux/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pcreux/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pcreux/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pcreux/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pcreux/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/activeadmin/activeadmin/issues/38/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/activeadmin/activeadmin/issues/38/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
