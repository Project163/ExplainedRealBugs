\r\n\r\n`ActiveFilter` was added to make the current filter sidebar a bit more humanized. It adds some cool things like smart, humanized filter names and, where possible, link to related resources with human readable names! Very cool. However, there's a few issues I saw when messing around a bit.\r\n\r\n1. If a filter with a related class (as `ActiveFilter` defines it) is given conditions that have no matching records in the related class, `ActiveFilter` produces an `ActiveRecord::RecordNotFound` when trying to generate a set of values to display in the \"Current Filters\" sidebar.\r\n2. If a filter is added to the resource that has a label specified, `ActiveFilter` ignores it in favor of pulling from `i18n`. This doesn't seem too terrible but can pose problems to the developer (see below)\r\n\r\nThe first issue I believe to be a regression. Even though, truthfully, there *is* no related record matching the filter criteria (and thus no resource records either), AA would display a blank slate in all other cases where a filter(s) produces no matching records.\r\n\r\nThe second issue, is more subtle. Most cases of custom labels are covered by the current implementation of `ActiveFilter`. After all, if you want the label of `Post#title` to be something other than \"Title\" just put it inside of `en.yml`, and `ActiveFilter` will do as you command. Here's the rub, imagine a more complex translation situation:\r\n\r\n```yaml\r\n# en.yml\r\nen:\r\n   activerecord:\r\n      attributes:\r\n         user:\r\n            external_id: \"%{client_name} External ID\" \r\n#...\r\n```\r\n```ruby\r\nActiveAdmin.register User do\r\n#...\r\nfilter :external_id, label: config.resource_class.human_attribute_name(:external_id, client_name: ENV[\"CLIENT\"])\r\nend\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn this example, we have an interpolation within our translation because the translation changes based on who's bought our super shiny app. In this situation, `ActiveFilter` would produce a `I18n::MissingInterpolationArgument` when trying to render the Current Filter sidebar with this attribute.\r\n\r\nWhile this example is a bit contrived, IMHO it's better to go with whatever the developer specifies as the attribute name. If the label on the filter is set, then that's takes precedence. If not, then the translations are certainly the next best thing.\r\n\r\nRelated issues:\r\n- #5164
