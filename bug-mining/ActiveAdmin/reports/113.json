We believe that this is completely unnecessary and a huge security risk in the (perhaps rare) case that the developers forget to either remove the user or change its credentials after deploying the app to a production environment. We find it much safer (and more natural) that the first admin user must be explicitly created through something like a console session.\n\nTracked down the line of code that adds the user creation to the Devise migration here, just so there's no confusion as to what I'm talking about here:\n\nhttps://github.com/activeadmin/activeadmin/blob/9c46b14ea0d9b3aaaa3d7520555c9959d06ce7f3/lib/generators/active_admin/devise/devise_generator.rb#L60\n\nThanks. :smiley: \n","closed_by":{"login":"timoschilling","id":165599,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NTU5OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/165599?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/timoschilling","html_url":"https://github.com/timoschilling","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timoschilling/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timoschilling/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timoschilling/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timoschilling/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timoschilling/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timoschilling/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timoschilling/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timoschilling/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timoschilling/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/activeadmin/activeadmin/issues/3988/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/activeadmin/activeadmin/issues/3988/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
