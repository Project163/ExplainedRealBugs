I changed `batch_action_path` in lib/active_admin/resource/batch_actions.rb from this:\n\n``` ruby\n# Path to the batch action itself\ndef batch_action_path\n  if belongs_to?\n    [:batch_action, namespace.name, belongs_to_config.target.underscored_resource_name, plural_underscored_resource_name]          \n  else\n    [:batch_action, namespace.name, plural_underscored_resource_name]\n  end\nend\n```\n\nto this:\n\n``` ruby\n# Path to the batch action itself\ndef batch_action_path\n  temp = if namespace.name == :root then nil else namespace.name end\n  if belongs_to?\n    [:batch_action, temp, belongs_to_config.target.underscored_resource_name, plural_underscored_resource_name]          \n  else\n    [:batch_action, temp, plural_underscored_resource_name]\n  end\nend\n```\n\nThe problem is that even though the batch_action route has been made properly, this part of the code only works when using a non-root configuration. So`namespace.name`  always has the value of your namespace (admin, pinky, brain, or even root) so the original code worked fine for any namespace of your choice... except root because root isn't a subdirectory like all others.\n","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/activeadmin/activeadmin/issues/comments/4142012/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"seanlinsley","id":688886,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4ODg4Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/688886?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanlinsley","html_url":"https://github.com/seanlinsley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanlinsley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanlinsley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanlinsley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanlinsley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanlinsley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanlinsley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanlinsley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanlinsley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanlinsley/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":10344170,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDEwMzQ0MTcw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/activeadmin/activeadmin/issues/events/10344170","actor":{"login":"mattvague","id":64985,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0OTg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/64985?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattvague","html_url":"https://github.com/mattvague","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattvague/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattvague/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattvague/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattvague/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattvague/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattvague/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattvague/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattvague/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattvague/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"8b9c3fe971f65d20d7f230115f4cabcbafc1131e","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mattvague/active_admin/commits/8b9c3fe971f65d20d7f230115f4cabcbafc1131e","created_at":"2012-02-28T03:47:54Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":10344177,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MTAzNDQxNzc=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/activeadmin/activeadmin/issues/events/10344177","actor":{"login":"mattvague","id":64985,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0OTg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/64985?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattvague","html_url":"https://github.com/mattvague","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattvague/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattvague/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattvague/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattvague/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattvague/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattvague/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattvague/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattvague/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattvague/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2012-02-28T03:48:03Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/activeadmin/activeadmin/issues/comments/4218612","html_url":"https://github.com/activeadmin/activeadmin/issues/1060#issuecomment-4218612","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/activeadmin/activeadmin/issues/1060","id":4218612,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQyMTg2MTI=","user":{"login":"seanlinsley","id":688886,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4ODg4Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/688886?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanlinsley","html_url":"https://github.com/seanlinsley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanlinsley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanlinsley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanlinsley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanlinsley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanlinsley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanlinsley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanlinsley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanlinsley/events{/privacy}
