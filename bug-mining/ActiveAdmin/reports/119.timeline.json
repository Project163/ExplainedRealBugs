It seems because the `select_and_search` css class is not added to the field.\nThis comes from this line from ActiveAdmin source: `(opts[:class] ||= '') << ' select_and_search' unless seems_searchable?`\n\nThe method `seems_searchable?` returns true if there is a ransacker defined with that name, I think that is causing the issue. Maybe it was bugged after ransack was introduced? I think the metasearch methods were named like `field_equals` but in ransacker it's just
