recently used ruby-prof to look at reload performance, like so:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nrequire 'ruby-prof'\r\n\r\nresult = RubyProf.profile do\r\n  Rails.application.reloader.reload!\r\nend\r\nprinter = RubyProf::MultiPrinter.new(result)\r\nprinter.print(path: \"/path/to/output\", profile: \"reload-profile\")\r\n```\r\n\r\nDoing so revealed that `ActiveAdmin.application.load!` is called twice. Since that method accounts for a substantial portion of the time it takes to reload our app, this seems quite wasteful.\r\n\r\nThe reason is that the `prepare` callback is invoked twice, from here:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/rails/rails/blob/v5.2.3/activesupport/lib/active_support/reloader.rb#L46\r\n\r\nand from here:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/rails/rails/blob/v5.2.3/activesupport/lib/active_support/reloader.rb#L59\r\n\r\nFor the \"load\" callback alone this wouldn't be a problem because it only calls `load!` if the application is not already loaded. However, the \"unload\" callback also uses the `prepare` callback, which results in the following order of callbacks:\r\n1. unload\r\n2. load\r\n3. unload\r\n4. load\r\n\r\nThat defeats the `loaded?` guard because by the time the \"load\" callback is invoked a second time, the application has been unloaded again.\r\n\r\nThis PR attempts to solve the problem by using the `class_unload` event instead of the `prepare` event for the \"unload\" callback. That event is only invoked once per reload.\r\n\r\nIt also removes the compatibility layer in `reloader.rb`. As far as I can tell, it is no longer needed now that support for Rails 4.x has been dropped.\r\n\r\nIt also simplifies the logic for registering the \"unload\" callback because the same callback works regardless of the setting for `reload_classes_only_on_change`.\r\n\r\nCloses #5739 \r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/activeadmin/activeadmin/issues/5740/reactions","total_count":4,"+1":4,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/activeadmin/activeadmin/issues/5740/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/activeadmin/activeadmin/issues/comments/482800958","html_url":"https://github.com/activeadmin/activeadmin/issues/5739#issuecomment-482800958","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/activeadmin/activeadmin/issues/5739","id":482800958,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ4MjgwMDk1OA==","user":{"login":"jscheid","id":3514,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1MTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3514?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jscheid","html_url":"https://github.com/jscheid","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jscheid/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jscheid/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jscheid/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jscheid/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jscheid/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jscheid/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jscheid/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jscheid/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jscheid/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-04-13T11:27:04Z","updated_at":"2019-04-13T11:27:04Z","body":"@deivid-rodriguez ah, I was looking but for some reason missed that one.\r\n\r\nI can't tell, it might be related?

Expected behavior\r\n\r\nWe were hoping the release 2 would bring some reload performance improvements in development mode.\r\n\r\n### Actual behavior\r\n\r\nReload performance (after touching some class in development mode) has become extremely slow. Strange enough enough, initial load is still about the same speed. \r\n\r\n## Context\r\n\r\n- rails 5.2.x\r\n- ruby 2.6.x\r\n- tested on 2 mac's : i5 / 16gb ram\r\n\r\n## analysis\r\n\r\nfrom the logs it seems that active admin now somehow triggers a multitude of the same class reloads, below just an extract of one request log that appears to trigger class reloading of the same classes multiple times (and the amount of times seems to be increasing per request)\r\n\r\n```\r\n/Users/koen/Personal/allcrux/app/admin/customer.rb:66: warning: already initialized constant
