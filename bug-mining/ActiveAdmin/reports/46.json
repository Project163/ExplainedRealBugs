using scope to restrict the records shown to the user:\n\n```\nscope_to :current_user, :association_method => :managed_reservations\n```\n\nThe method `managed_reservations` calls a query\n\n```\nReservation.joins(:user).select(\"reservations.*, (users.location_id = #{location_id}) AS local\").order('local DESC')\n```\n\nThe key problem here is that there's an ordering by a virtual column `local`. For its internal queries ActiveAdmin replaces select statement with '1' (perhaps to check if any records exist), but doesn't replace the order statement which is then referencing a non-existent column and thus fails. The resulting SQL looks like:\n\n```\nSELECT  1 FROM \"reservations\" INNER JOIN \"users\" ... ORDER BY local DESC, \"reservations\".id desc LIMIT 1 OFFSET 0\n```\n\nSo I suggest to replace the order statement in such queries too. For now I'm reverting to 0.3.4 which seems to not having this issue.\n","closed_by":{"login":"gregbell","id":719,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcxOQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/719?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gregbell","html_url":"https://github.com/gregbell","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gregbell/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gregbell/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gregbell/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gregbell/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gregbell/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gregbell/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gregbell/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gregbell/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gregbell/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/activeadmin/activeadmin/issues/994/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/activeadmin/activeadmin/issues/994/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
