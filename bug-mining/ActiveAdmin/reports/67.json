The resulting code looked something like this:\n\n``` RUBY\nf.inputs \"Preferences\" do \n  Customer::PREFERENCES.map{ |pref| f.input pref, as: :boolean }\nend\n```\n\nBecause of the `@inputs_with_block` instance variable, I can't do this without having the content repeat itself `Customer::PREFERENCES.length` times. As a work-around, I thought to implement something like the following method inside ActiveAdmin::FormBuilder:\n\n``` RUBY\n# If this `input` call is inside a `inputs` block, return it directly.\ndef input!(method, *args)\n  # Temporarily set @inputs_with_block false and call `input` method\nend\n```\n\nThis allows the initial code to be written like this:\n\n``` RUBY\nf.inputs \"Preferences\" do \n  Customer::PREFERENCES.map{ |pref| f.input! pref, as: :boolean }\nend\n```\n\nI feel that this is non-invasive and allows some flexibility in how AA forms are defined.\n\nIf this is something welcome / desired, I'll open up a pull-request.\n","closed_by":{"login":"seanlinsley","id":688886,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4ODg4Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/688886?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanlinsley","html_url":"https://github.com/seanlinsley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanlinsley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanlinsley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanlinsley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanlinsley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanlinsley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanlinsley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanlinsley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanlinsley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanlinsley/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/activeadmin/activeadmin/issues/2192/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/activeadmin/activeadmin/issues/2192/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
