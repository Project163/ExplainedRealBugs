I've spent many hours trying to get around limitations only to bump up against another every time. It's also hard to justify the risk of time given that the master branch might diverge even further from what I might expect.\n\nThe architecture of this gem is quite clever and I like a lot about it, including the arbre library (which I would love to see extracted for use externally). But, as an example, I think the choice to use a DSL to generate an application layout assumes a very narrow use-case, diverges too far from the Rails Way and makes it very difficult (or at least non-DRY) to integrate into, at least, my projects and leverage a consistent user experience. The master branch focus has some basic assumptions that don't yet allow for as much flexibility as my projects require, and I think there are still some critically hooks as well. I do expect that to improve, but, the layout issue still troubles me a lot and prevents me from confidently embracing it as a key component of my apps.\n\nSo, I assume the present goals of the project are for it to be a sidelined admin interface. Best use is to not fight the defaults, and wait for the it to
