Expected behavior\r\n\r\nWhat do you think should happen?\r\n\r\nRails 4.2, Active Admin 1.0 @ Master, June 1st.

Once upgraded to master, it no longer works with a route as http://myresource.com/admin/titles.json (with an authenticated admin user) to return a json list of titles. \r\n\r\nIn migration docs, I was unable to find this change.  \r\n\r\n### Actual behavior\r\n\r\nWhat actually happens?\r\n\r\n It presents as \"Unauthorized\".  \r\n\r\n### How to reproduce\r\n\r\nCreate a new rails app and set up activeadmin.  Migrate at least one field and create the admin interface.  Browse to the index view and then add .json to the route.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/activeadmin/activeadmin/issues/5080/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/activeadmin/activeadmin/issues/5080/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
