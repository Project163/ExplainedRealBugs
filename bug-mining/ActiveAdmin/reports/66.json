These filenames are in singular form.\n\nWhen the `active_admin:resource` generator is ran with the parameter `MyModel`, it creates a file in `app/admin/` with `my_models.rb`. This filename is [made plural in the resource generator](https://github.com/gregbell/active_admin/blob/02960bb5f81e43dbd5c02f870fd07d4c77bf5ab8/lib/generators/active_admin/resource/resource_generator.rb#L11).\n\nAs evidenced in issues #1960 and #1961, it seems the _de facto_ standard is to use the singular form for naming. Is this an oversight in the resource generator where the filenames should actually be in singular form?\n","closed_by":{"login":"seanlinsley","id":688886,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4ODg4Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/688886?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanlinsley","html_url":"https://github.com/seanlinsley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanlinsley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanlinsley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanlinsley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanlinsley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanlinsley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanlinsley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanlinsley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanlinsley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanlinsley/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/activeadmin/activeadmin/issues/2249/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/activeadmin/activeadmin/issues/2249/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
