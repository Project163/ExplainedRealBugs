#542. Devise has been removed from gemspec and the integration will not be enabled by default when the generator is run. Default behaviour will be the equivalent of --skip-users \n\nTo use devise integration, the user will have to add it to Gemfile and then run the generator with the --devise option. \n\nI didn't find any tests for --skip-users. I was not very sure of how to add tests for without devise integration. So I have modified the test template to enable devise integration by default. \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/activeadmin/activeadmin/issues/1149/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/activeadmin/activeadmin/issues/1149/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":12274693,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDEyMjc0Njkz","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/activeadmin/activeadmin/issues/events/12274693","actor":{"login":"kstevens715","id":1191305,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExOTEzMDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1191305?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kstevens715","html_url":"https://github.com/kstevens715","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kstevens715/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kstevens715/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kstevens715/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kstevens715/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kstevens715/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kstevens715/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kstevens715/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kstevens715/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kstevens715/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2012-03-28T16:51:30Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":14750146,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MTQ3NTAxNDY=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/activeadmin/activeadmin/issues/events/14750146","actor":{"login":"j-manu","id":72501,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcyNTAx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/72501?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/j-manu","html_url":"https://github.com/j-manu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/j-manu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/j-manu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/j-manu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/j-manu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/j-manu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/j-manu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/j-manu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/j-manu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/j-manu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2012-05-04T07:21:54Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
