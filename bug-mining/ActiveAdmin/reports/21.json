active_admin stylesheets reference images from css with a simple url('/images/...') expression, but that is not where the images are when using the asset pipeline. Presumably in production this would double-fail because of the sprockets-computed hash-keyed name for the asset. \n\nI messed around with renaming _base and _header to have an erb suffix and using image_path, but I wasn't able to get it to work. Not sure if that's to do with how sprockets works with rails engines or just how the sass compiles (I'm not very familiar with sass). \n\nI was able to work around this in my rails app without copying the images into public by just overriding the background-image properties in app/assets/stylesheets/active_admin.css.scss.erb: https://gist.github.com/1059513\n","closed_by":{"login":"gregbell","id":719,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcxOQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/719?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gregbell","html_url":"https://github.com/gregbell","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gregbell/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gregbell/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gregbell/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gregbell/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gregbell/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gregbell/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gregbell/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gregbell/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gregbell/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/activeadmin/activeadmin/issues/246/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/activeadmin/activeadmin/issues/246/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
