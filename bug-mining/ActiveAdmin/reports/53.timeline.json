how I would approach it: don't use default scopes for sort order. And for the admin section, make it possible to specify a preferred sort order right in the active_admin DSL file. That should be pretty easy to implement.\n\nIt doesn't solve the case where the default_scope's sort order is set anyway. However IMHO, default_scope should be used only for critical stuff, like \"don't display unpublished posts\".\n\nIf you use it to sort, you're going to have to override it explicitly any time you need a different sort order. And doing that doesn't simply entail tacking on another order() clause to override it. It means, as tobyhede pointed out, that you have to start from scratch with `with_exclusive_scope` and then re-apply the critical parts of the default_scope if there's any. Which is annoying and error-prone.\n\nJust my 2¢
