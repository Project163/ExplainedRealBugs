believe this is the expected behavior for `new_record: false`. If you want to limit the form to only having one nested resource, I would recommend doing one of two things:\n1. Build the new associated resource in your `new` action or `after_initialize` in your model. If you do this, you will get the form to show up on the page, but the `new_record` button will not be there.\n2. Use your nested resource limit as a conditional for the `new_record` option, and also hook into the `before/after add/remove` javascript hooks that AA provides to hide or show the `new_record` button:\n\n``` ruby\n# form\nform do |f|\n  f.has_many :booking_prices, new_record: (f.object.booking_prices.count < 3) do |pf|\n    pf.inputs\n  end\nend\n```\n\n``` coffeescript\n# Coffeescript\n# Note, you should target a more specific container than I do here or it will apply to all of them\n\n$(document).on 'has_many_add:after', '.has_many_container', (e, fieldset) ->\n  fieldset.find('.has_many_remove').hide() if $(@).children('fieldset').length >= 3\n\n$(document).on 'has_many_remove:after', '.has_many_container', (e, fieldset) ->\n  fieldset.find('.has_many_remove').show() if $(@).children('fieldset').length < 3\n```\n","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/activeadmin/activeadmin/issues/comments/30934497/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"shekibobo","id":293858,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5Mzg1OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/293858?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/shekibobo","html_url":"https://github.com/shekibobo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shekibobo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shekibobo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shekibobo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shekibobo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shekibobo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shekibobo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shekibobo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shekibobo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shekibobo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/activeadmin/activeadmin/issues/comments/30947347","html_url":"https://github.com/activeadmin/activeadmin/issues/2773#issuecomment-30947347","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/activeadmin/activeadmin/issues/2773","id":30947347,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMwOTQ3MzQ3","user":{"login":"djpate","id":512939,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxMjkzOQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/512939?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/djpate","html_url":"https://github.com/djpate","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/djpate/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/djpate/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/djpate/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/djpate/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/djpate/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/djpate/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/djpate/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/djpate/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/djpate/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2013-12-19T17:16:55Z","updated_at":"2013-12-19T17:16:55Z","body":"I don't agree.
