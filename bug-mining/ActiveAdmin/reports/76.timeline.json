\n\nI believe this issue should be reopened. It's not a case of just customizing default behavior, but the default behaviour itself seems to be wrong.\n\nSee, if you go to http://demo.activeadmin.info/admin/products/new you'll notice that there's no \"New Product\" button visible. Great.\n\nBut if try to create an empty product, the path will change to http://demo.activeadmin.info/admin/products and \"New Product\" button will be visible.\n\nEither you should be redirected back to .../new or the fix suggested by @bubaz should be applied.\n\nOBS: The same behaviour occurs when you try to edit an existing product with validation
