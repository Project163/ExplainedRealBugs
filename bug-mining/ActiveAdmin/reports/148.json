The package.json you linked shows the package's name is \"@activeadmin/activeadmin\" (line 2) and it lists the exact same string in dependencies (line 47). That is a self-dependency.\n\nWhy that’s problematic\n- npm/yarn resolve dependencies from the registry, not from your working tree. Installing this package from source can cause the package manager to fetch the published @activeadmin/activeadmin@^3.3.0 from the registry instead of using the local code.\n- It will create a nested/duplicate copy of the package (the published ^3.3.0) under node_modules, which is confusing and can lead to runtime/version-mismatch bugs.\n- It’s semantically redundant: a package doesn’t need to depend on itself. It also creates a circular/self reference which offers no benefit in normal setups.\n\nWhen it might be intentional\n- If there were two different packages with the same scope but different names (e.g., @activeadmin/core vs @activeadmin/activeadmin) a dependency would make sense — but here the names are identical.\n- In a monorepo you might depend on another workspace package; that still requires a different package name or using workspace:file: or workspace: protocol. It would not use the same package name as the current package.json.\n\nWhat I recommend\n- Remove the \"@activeadmin/activeadmin\": \"^3.3.0\" entry unless there is a documented reason for it.\n- If they intended to depend on a different package, change the dependency to the correct package name/version.\n- If they intended to require a peer-provided version, use peerDependencies.\n- If you want, I can: (a) search the git history to see who/when this line was added, or (b) prepare a small PR to remove it. Which would you prefer?","closed_by":{"login":"tagliala","id":556268,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1NjI2OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/556268?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tagliala","html_url":"https://github.com/tagliala","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tagliala/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tagliala/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tagliala/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tagliala/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tagliala/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tagliala/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tagliala/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tagliala/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tagliala/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/activeadmin/activeadmin/issues/8846/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/activeadmin/activeadmin/issues/8846/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
