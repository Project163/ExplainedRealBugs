However, the config option still seems to indicate that the option name (for enabling/disabling comments) is 'admin_notes'. If you choose to disable admin_notes right now in the initializer (as shown below), it'll break, as ShowPageHelper is looking for active_admin_config.comments? rather than active_admin_config.admin_notes?\n\n```\nActiveAdmin.setup do |config|\n    config.admin_notes = true\nend\n```\n\nI fixed this in our fork by reverting to the admin_notes option that's already available. However, I assume the right thing to do is to update the rest of the project to use 'comments'. Didn't want to make that change without discussing it first though, as I wasn't sure what the intentions were. And I also seem to have failures on the master branch atm (on both Rails 3.0.7 and 3.1.0 edge).\n\nhttps://github.com/wantful/active_admin/commit/78e8778949a1407d48293afe9d9ccb396fffa65d\n","closed_by":{"login":"gregbell","id":719,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcxOQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/719?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gregbell","html_url":"https://github.com/gregbell","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gregbell/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gregbell/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gregbell/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gregbell/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gregbell/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gregbell/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gregbell/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gregbell/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gregbell/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/activeadmin/activeadmin/issues/73/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/activeadmin/activeadmin/issues/73/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
