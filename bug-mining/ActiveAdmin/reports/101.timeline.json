Environment\r\n\r\n- Ruby 3.3.4\r\n- Rails 7.2.1\r\n- Devise 4.9.4\r\n\r\n## Current behavior\r\n\r\nWhen using `timeoutable`, a time out results in two messages being assigned to flash, an alert (expected) and a message of type `\"timedout\"` with value `true` (unexpected).\r\n\r\n## Expected behavior\r\n\r\nThat the Flash will only contain notices and alerts.\r\n\r\nI realise this has been raised previously (multiple times, see below) and the most prominent one was marked as \"resolved\" (https://github.com/heartcombo/devise/pull/1993) but I wonder if, 10-15 years later, we can revisit the decision since it's still tripping people up?\r\n\r\nThe [documentation](https://api.rubyonrails.org/v7.2.1/classes/ActionDispatch/Flash.html) refers to \"notices and alerts\" and specifically calls out that the flash is automatically exposed to the template. Tutorials ([RubyGuides](https://www.rubyguides.com/2019/11/rails-flash-messages/), [Rapid Ruby](https://rapidruby.com/lessons/22-flash-messages-with-hotwire), [Reinteractive](https://reinteractive.com/articles/how-to-create-flash-messages-in-Rails-7) [and](https://www.hotrails.dev/turbo-rails/flash-messages-hotwire) [many](https://bootrails.com/blog/how-to-use-rails-flash-messages/) [more](https://dev.to/bdavidxyz/rails-flash-messages-and-ux-3kep)) almost always assume the Flash will only contain user facing messages that have been exposed to the template. It seems like a pretty solid convention.\r\n\r\nFor over a decade, and to this day, people have been:\r\n\r\n-  asking about it on Stackoverflow ([1](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/12256203/devise-timedout-error-showing-true), [2](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/27538622/message-true-flashes-on-main-page-after-session-timeout), [3](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/31600512/devise-3-5-x-on-rails-4-2-x-timeout-prints-true-underneath-timeout-flash-messa))\r\n- raising issues in this repo ([1](https://github.com/heartcombo/devise/issues/193), [2](https://github.com/heartcombo/devise/issues/219), [3](https://github.com/heartcombo/devise/issues/1777), [4](https://github.com/heartcombo/devise/issues/2417), [5](https://github.com/heartcombo/devise/issues/2787))\r\n- discussing it and working around it in other repos ([Active Admin](https://github.com/activeadmin/activeadmin/issues/3316), [The Odin Project](https://github.com/TheOdinProject/theodinproject/pull/4564) [and](https://github.com/leonid-shevtsov/unobtrusive_flash) [many](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/Claim-for-Crown-Court-Defence/pull/5203) [more](https://github.com/tramlinehq/tramline/pull/140)), with many references to this as a bug in Devise\r\n\r\n## Workaround\r\n\r\nIn case the decision stands and someone else stumbles across this in the future and isn't helped by the terse message in the readme (https://github.com/heartcombo/devise/pull/1993), I've worked around it by skipping messages of type \"timedout\" (`next if type == \"timedout\"`). Another suggestion is to check if the message/value is a string (`next unless message.is_a? String`).\r\n\r\nHere is that line with a bit more context from my view partial in case it's helpful:\r\n\r\n```rb\r\n# app/views/shared/_flash_messages.html.erb\r\n<% if flash.any? %>\r\n  <div class=\"inset-0 p-2 items-start justify-end\">\r\n    <div class=\"flex flex-col items-center justify-center\">\r\n      <% flash.each do |type, message| %>\r\n        <% next if type == \"timedout\" %>\r\n        <div class=\"<%= flash_colour_class(type.to_sym) %> border-2 px-4 py-3 mb-4 rounded relative\" role=\"alert\">\r\n          <strong class=\"font-bold\"><%= \"#{type.capitalize}\" %></strong>\r\n          <span class=\"block sm:inline\"><%= message %></span>\r\n        </div>\r\n      <% end %>\r\n    </div>\r\n  </div>\r\n<% end %>\r\n```","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/heartcombo/devise/issues/5722/reactions","total_count":5,"+1":5,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/heartcombo/devise/issues/5722/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":15572947361,"node_id":"SE_lADOAAlWUc4CW5eczwAAAAOgOFGh","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/activeadmin/activeadmin/issues/events/15572947361","actor":null,"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2024-12-08T14:28:13Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
