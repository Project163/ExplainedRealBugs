There is the following deprecation warning flooding our logs:\n\n```\nWARNING: The box-sizing mixin is deprecated and will be removed in the next major version release. This property can now be used un-prefixed.\non line 410 of /var/www/production/shared/bundle/ruby/2.2.0/gems/bourbon-4.2.1/app/assets/stylesheets/_bourbon-deprecated-upcoming.scss, \nin `box-sizing' from line 4 of /var/www/production/releases/20150305084947/vendor/cache/activeadmin-e27ccba8a7ea/app/assets/stylesheets/active_admin/structure/_title_bar.scss ...\n```\n\nAs the message tells and as it can be seen at http://caniuse.com/#search=box-sizing, there is no need for prefixing any more. My suggestion is to remove the mixin in https://github.com/activeadmin/activeadmin/blob/6bde1f57ec5f9b724c21e5af146678f4ade839bc/app/assets/stylesheets/active_admin/mixins/_utilities.scss#L11 and change all places where it is used. A quick search in the compiled CSS file showed 15 of them.\n\nIf you agree, I am happy to send a PR.\n\nCheers\n\nAndy\n","closed_by":{"login":"timoschilling","id":165599,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NTU5OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/165599?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/timoschilling","html_url":"https://github.com/timoschilling","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timoschilling/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timoschilling/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timoschilling/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timoschilling/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timoschilling/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timoschilling/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timoschilling/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timoschilling/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timoschilling/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/activeadmin/activeadmin/issues/3832/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/activeadmin/activeadmin/issues/3832/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
