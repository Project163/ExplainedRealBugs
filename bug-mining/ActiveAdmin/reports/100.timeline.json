The proposal is still a work in progress and is still undergoing significant changes before being finalized. However, the first iteration has already been shipping in Chromium-based browsers for a while, and the second iteration has landed in V8 and is now shipping in node, so it makes sense for esbuild to support it. Here are the two major iterations of this proposal (so far):</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Import assertions (deprecated, will not be standardized)</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Uses the <code>assert</code> keyword</li>\n<li>Does <em>not</em> affect module resolution</li>\n<li>Causes an error if the assertion fails</li>\n<li>Shipping in Chrome 91+ (and in esbuild 0.11.22+)</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Import attributes (currently set to become standardized)</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Uses the <code>with</code> keyword</li>\n<li>Affects module resolution</li>\n<li>Unknown attributes cause an error</li>\n<li>Shipping in node 21+</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>You can already use esbuild to bundle code that uses import assertions (the first iteration). However, this feature is mostly useless for bundlers because import assertions are not allowed to affect module resolution. It's basically only useful as an annotation on external imports, which esbuild will then preserve in the output for use in a browser (which would otherwise refuse to load certain imports).</p>\n<p>With this release, esbuild now supports bundling code that uses import attributes (the second iteration). This is much more useful for bundlers because they are allowed to affect module resolution, which means the key-value pairs can be provided to plugins. Here's an example, which uses esbuild's built-in support for the upcoming <a href=\"https://snyk.io/redirect/github/tc39/proposal-json-modules\">JSON module standard</a>:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight highlight-source-js notranslate position-relative overflow-auto\" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content=\"// On static imports\nimport foo from './package.json' with { type: 'json' }\nconsole.log(foo)\n\n// On dynamic imports\nconst bar = await import('./package.json', { with: { type: 'json' } })\nconsole.log(bar)\"><pre><span class=\"pl-c\">// On static imports</span>\n<span class=\"pl-k\">import</span> <span class=\"pl-s1\">foo</span> <span class=\"pl-k\">from</span> <span class=\"pl-s\">'./package.json'</span> <span class=\"pl-s1\">with</span> <span class=\"pl-kos\">{</span> <span class=\"pl-s1\">type</span>: '<span class=\"pl-s1\">json</span>' <span class=\"pl-kos\">}</span>\n<span class=\"pl-smi\">console</span><span class=\"pl-kos\">.</span><span class=\"pl-en\">log</span><span class=\"pl-kos\">(</span><span class=\"pl-s1\">foo</span><span class=\"pl-kos\">)</span>\n\n<span class=\"pl-c\">// On dynamic imports</span>\n<span class=\"pl-k\">const</span> <span class=\"pl-s1\">bar</span> <span class=\"pl-c1\">=</span> <span class=\"pl-k\">await</span> <span class=\"pl-k\">import</span><span class=\"pl-kos\">(</span><span class=\"pl-s\">'./package.json'</span><span class=\"pl-kos\">,</span> <span class=\"pl-kos\">{</span> <span class=\"pl-c1\">with</span>: <span class=\"pl-kos\">{</span> <span class=\"pl-c1\">type</span>: <span class=\"pl-s\">'json'</span> <span class=\"pl-kos\">}</span> <span class=\"pl-kos\">}</span><span class=\"pl-kos\">)</span>\n<span class=\"pl-smi\">console</span><span class=\"pl-kos\">.</span><span class=\"pl-en\">log</span><span class=\"pl-kos\">(</span><span class=\"pl-s1\">bar</span><span class=\"pl-kos\">)</span></pre></div>\n<p>One important consequence of the change in semantics between import assertions and import attributes is that two imports with identical paths but different import attributes are now considered to be different modules. This is because the import attributes are provided to the loader, which might then use those attributes during loading. For example, you could imagine an image loader that produces an image of a different size depending on the import attributes.</p>\n<p>Import attributes are now reported in the <a href=\"https://esbuild.github.io/api/#metafile\" rel=\"nofollow\">metafile</a> and are now provided to <a href=\"https://esbuild.github.io/plugins/#on-load\" rel=\"nofollow\">on-load plugins</a> as a map in the <code>with</code> property. For example, here's an esbuild plugin that turns all imports with a <code>type</code> import attribute equal to <code>'cheese'</code> into a module that exports the cheese emoji:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight highlight-source-js notranslate position-relative overflow-auto\" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content=\"const cheesePlugin = {\n  name: 'cheese',\n  setup(build) {\n    build.onLoad({ filter: /.*/ }, args =&gt; {\n      if (args.with.type === 'cheese') return {\n        contents: `export default &quot;🧀&quot;`,\n      }\n    })\n  }\n}\n\nrequire('esbuild').build({\n  bundle: true,\n  write: false,\n  stdin: {\n    contents: `\n      import foo from 'data:text/javascript,' with { type: 'cheese' }\n      console.log(foo)\n    `,\n  },\n  plugins: [cheesePlugin],\n}).then(result =&gt; {\n  const code = new Function(result.outputFiles[0].text)\n  code()\n})\"><pre><span class=\"pl-k\">const</span> <span class=\"pl-s1\">cheesePlugin</span> <span class=\"pl-c1\">=</span> <span class=\"pl-kos\">{</span>\n  <span class=\"pl-c1\">name</span>: <span class=\"pl-s\">'cheese'</span><span class=\"pl-kos\">,</span>\n  <span class=\"pl-en\">setup</span><span class=\"pl-kos\">(</span><span class=\"pl-s1\">build</span><span class=\"pl-kos\">)</span> <span class=\"pl-kos\">{</span>\n    <span class=\"pl-s1\">build</span><span class=\"pl-kos\">.</span><span class=\"pl-en\">onLoad</span><span class=\"pl-kos\">(</span><span class=\"pl-kos\">{</span> <span class=\"pl-c1\">filter</span>: <span class=\"pl-pds\"><span class=\"pl-c1\">/</span>.<span class=\"pl-c1\">*</span><span class=\"pl-c1\">/</span></span> <span class=\"pl-kos\">}</span><span class=\"pl-kos\">,</span> <span class=\"pl-s1\">args</span> <span class=\"pl-c1\">=&gt;</span> <span class=\"pl-kos\">{</span>\n      <span class=\"pl-k\">if</span> <span class=\"pl-kos\">(</span><span class=\"pl-s1\">args</span><span class=\"pl-kos\">.</span><span class=\"pl-c1\">with</span><span class=\"pl-kos\">.</span><span class=\"pl-c1\">type</span> <span class=\"pl-c1\">===</span> <span class=\"pl-s\">'cheese'</span><span class=\"pl-kos\">)</span> <span class=\"pl-k\">return</span> <span class=\"pl-kos\">{</span>\n        <span class=\"pl-c1\">contents</span>: <span class=\"pl-s\">`export default \"🧀\"`</span><span class=\"pl-kos\">,</span>\n      <span class=\"pl-kos\">}</span>\n    <span class=\"pl-kos\">}</span><span class=\"pl-kos\">)</span>\n  <span class=\"pl-kos\">}</span>\n<span class=\"pl-kos\">}</span>\n\n<span class=\"pl-en\">require</span><span class=\"pl-kos\">(</span><span class=\"pl-s\">'esbuild'</span><span class=\"pl-kos\">)</span><span class=\"pl-kos\">.</span><span class=\"pl-en\">build</span><span class=\"pl-kos\">(</span><span class=\"pl-kos\">{</span>\n  <span class=\"pl-c1\">bundle</span>: <span class=\"pl-c1\">true</span><span class=\"pl-kos\">,</span>\n  <span class=\"pl-c1\">write</span>: <span class=\"pl-c1\">false</span><span class=\"pl-kos\">,</span>\n  <span class=\"pl-c1\">stdin</span>: <span class=\"pl-kos\">{</span>\n    <span class=\"pl-c1\">contents</span>: <span class=\"pl-s\">`</span>\n<span class=\"pl-s\">      import foo from 'data:text/javascript,' with { type: 'cheese' }</span>\n<span class=\"pl-s\">      console.log(foo)</span>\n<span class=\"pl-s\">    `</span><span class=\"pl-kos\">,</span>\n  <span class=\"pl-kos\">}</span><span class=\"pl-kos\">,</span>\n  <span class=\"pl-c1\">plugins</span>: <span class=\"pl-kos\">[</span><span class=\"pl-s1\">cheesePlugin</span><span class=\"pl-kos\">]</span><span class=\"pl-kos\">,</span>\n<span class=\"pl-kos\">}</span><span class=\"pl-kos\">)</span><span class=\"pl-kos\">.</span><span class=\"pl-en\">then</span><span class=\"pl-kos\">(</span><span class=\"pl-s1\">result</span> <span class=\"pl-c1\">=&gt;</span> <span class=\"pl-kos\">{</span>\n  <span class=\"pl-k\">const</span> <span class=\"pl-s1\">code</span> <span class=\"pl-c1\">=</span> <span class=\"pl-k\">new</span> <span class=\"pl-v\">Function</span><span class=\"pl-kos\">(</span><span class=\"pl-s1\">result</span><span class=\"pl-kos\">.</span><span class=\"pl-c1\">outputFiles</span><span class=\"pl-kos\">[</span><span class=\"pl-c1\">0</span><span class=\"pl-kos\">]</span><span class=\"pl-kos\">.</span><span class=\"pl-c1\">text</span><span class=\"pl-kos\">)</span>\n  <span class=\"pl-s1\">code</span><span class=\"pl-kos\">(</span><span class=\"pl-kos\">)</span>\n<span class=\"pl-kos\">}</span><span class=\"pl-kos\">)</span></pre></div>\n<p>Warning: It's possible that the second iteration of this feature may change significantly again even though it's already shipping in real JavaScript VMs (since it has already happened once before). In that case, esbuild may end up adjusting its implementation to match the eventual standard behavior. So keep in mind that by using this, you are using an unstable upcoming JavaScript feature that may undergo breaking changes in the future.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Adjust TypeScript experimental decorator behavior (<a href=\"https://snyk.io/redirect/github/evanw/esbuild/issues/3230\" data-hovercard-type=\"issue\" data-hovercard-url=\"/evanw/esbuild/issues/3230/hovercard\">#3230</a>, <a href=\"https://snyk.io/redirect/github/evanw/esbuild/issues/3326\" data-hovercard-type=\"issue\" data-hovercard-url=\"/evanw/esbuild/issues/3326/hovercard\">#3326</a>, <a href=\"https://snyk.io/redirect/github/evanw/esbuild/issues/3394\" data-hovercard-type=\"issue\" data-hovercard-url=\"/evanw/esbuild/issues/3394/hovercard\">#3394</a>)</p>\n<p>With this release, esbuild will now allow TypeScript experimental decorators to access both static class properties and <code>#private</code> class names.

Previously esbuild evaluated TypeScript decorators outside of the class body, so it didn't allow decorators to access <code>Foo</code> or <code>#foo</code>. Now esbuild does something different, although it's hard to concisely explain exactly what esbuild is doing now (see the background section below for more information).</p>\n<p>Note that TypeScript's experimental decorator support is currently buggy: TypeScript's compiler passes this test if only the first <code>@ check</code> is present or if only the second <code>@ check</code> is present, but TypeScript's compiler fails this test if both checks are present together. I haven't changed esbuild to match TypeScript's behavior exactly here because I'm waiting for TypeScript to fix these bugs instead.</p>\n<p>Some background: TypeScript experimental decorators don't have consistent semantics regarding the context that the decorators are evaluated in. For example, TypeScript will let you use <code>await</code> within a decorator, which implies that the decorator runs outside the class body (since <code>await</code> isn't supported inside a class body), but TypeScript will also let you use <code>#private</code> names, which implies that the decorator runs inside the class body (since <code>#private</code> names are only supported inside a class body). The value of <code>this</code> in a decorator is also buggy (the run-time value of <code>this</code> changes if any decorator in the class uses a <code>#private</code> name but the type of <code>this</code> doesn't change, leading to the type checker no longer matching reality). These inconsistent semantics make it hard for esbuild to implement this feature as decorator evaluation happens in some superposition of both inside and outside the class body that is particular to the internal implementation details of the TypeScript compiler.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Forbid <code>--keep-names</code> when targeting old browsers (<a href=\"https://snyk.io/redirect/github/evanw/esbuild/issues/3477\" data-hovercard-type=\"issue\" data-hovercard-url=\"/evanw/esbuild/issues/3477/hovercard\">#3477</a>)</p>\n<p>The <code>--keep-names</code> setting needs to be able to assign to the <code>name</code> property on functions and classes. However, before ES6 this property was non-configurable, and attempting to assign to it would throw an error. So with this release, esbuild will no longer allow you to enable this setting while also targeting a really old browser.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n      </li>\n      <li>\n        <b>0.19.6</b> - <a href=\"https://snyk.io/redirect/github/evanw/esbuild/releases/tag/v0.19.6\">2023-11-19</a></br><a href=\"https://snyk.io/redirect/github/evanw/esbuild/releases/tag/v0.19.6\"> Read more </a>\n      </li>\n      <li>\n        <b>0.19.5</b> - <a href=\"https://snyk.io/redirect/github/evanw/esbuild/releases/tag/v0.19.5\">2023-10-17</a></br><ul>\n<li>\n<p>Fix a regression in 0.19.0 regarding <code>paths</code> in <code>tsconfig.json</code> (<a href=\"https://snyk.io/redirect/github/evanw/esbuild/issues/3354\" data-hovercard-type=\"issue\" data-hovercard-url=\"/evanw/esbuild/issues/3354/hovercard\">#3354</a>)</p>\n<p>The fix in esbuild version 0.19.0 to process <code>tsconfig.json</code> aliases before the <code>--packages=external</code> setting unintentionally broke an edge case in esbuild's handling of certain <code>tsconfig.json</code> aliases where there are multiple files with the same name in different directories. This release adjusts esbuild's behavior for this edge case so that it passes while still processing aliases before <code>--packages=external</code>.

With this release, esbuild will now quote all bundled asset references in <code>url()</code> tokens to avoid this problem. This only affects assets loaded using the <code>file</code> and <code>copy</code> loaders.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Fix invalid CSS <code>url()</code> tokens in <code>@ import</code> rules (<a href=\"https://snyk.io/redirect/github/evanw/esbuild/issues/3426\" data-hovercard-type=\"issue\" data-hovercard-url=\"/evanw/esbuild/issues/3426/hovercard\">#3426</a>)</p>\n<p>In the future, CSS <code>url()</code> tokens may contain additional stuff after the URL. This is irrelevant today as no CSS specification does this. But esbuild previously had a bug where using these tokens in an <code>@ import</code> rule resulted in malformed output. This bug has been fixed.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Fix <code>browser</code> + <code>false</code> + <code>type: module</code> in <code>package.json</code> (<a href=\"https://snyk.io/redirect/github/evanw/esbuild/issues/3367\" data-hovercard-type=\"issue\" data-hovercard-url=\"/evanw/esbuild/issues/3367/hovercard\">#3367</a>)</p>\n<p>The <code>browser</code> field in <code>package.json</code> allows you to map a file to <code>false</code> to have it be treated as an empty file when bundling for the browser. However, if <code>package.json</code> contains <code>\"type\": \"module\"</code> then all <code>.js</code> files will be considered ESM, not CommonJS. Importing a named import from an empty CommonJS file gives you undefined, but importing a named export from an empty ESM file is a build error. This release changes esbuild's interpretation of these files mapped to <code>false</code> in this situation from ESM to CommonJS to avoid generating build errors for named imports.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Fix a bug in top-level await error reporting (<a href=\"https://snyk.io/redirect/github/evanw/esbuild/issues/3400\" data-hovercard-type=\"issue\" data-hovercard-url=\"/evanw/esbuild/issues/3400/hovercard\">#3400</a>)</p>\n<p>Using <code>require()</code> on a file that contains <a href=\"https://v8.dev/features/top-level-await\" rel=\"nofollow\">top-level await</a> is not allowed because <code>require()</code> must return synchronously and top-level await makes that impossible. You will get a build error if you try to bundle code that does this with esbuild. This release fixes a bug in esbuild's error reporting code for complex cases of this situation involving multiple levels of imports to get to the module containing the top-level await.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Update to Unicode 15.1.0</p>\n<p>The character tables that determine which characters form valid JavaScript identifiers have been updated from Unicode version 15.0.0 to the newly-released Unicode version 15.1.0.

With this release, esbuild will now bundle <code>@ import</code> rules with these trailing tokens and will wrap the imported files in the corresponding rules. Note that this now means a given imported file can potentially appear in multiple places in the bundle. However, esbuild will still only load it once (e.g. on-load plugins will only run once per file, not once per import).</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n      </li>\n    </ul>\n    from <a href=\"https://snyk.io/redirect/github/evanw/esbuild/releases\">esbuild GitHub release notes</a>\n  </details>\n</details>\n\n\n<details>\n  <summary><b>Commit messages</b></summary>\n  </br>\n  <details>\n    <summary>Package name: <b>esbuild</b></summary>\n    <ul>\n      <li><a href=\"https://snyk.io/redirect/github/evanw/esbuild/commit/a7773b340bb216d053df91b7479b5aa2a152b0de\">a7773b3</a> publish 0.19.7 to npm</li>\n      <li><a href=\"https://snyk.io/redirect/github/evanw/esbuild/commit/2886b5db37d8f9b85547788a905e863d98151a5b\">2886b5d</a> more adjustments to import assertions/attributes</li>\n      <li><a href=\"https://snyk.io/redirect/github/evanw/esbuild/commit/2dad8309fcec8f668abe0619f531cf0375da2e7b\">2dad830</a> add basic support for import assertions</li>\n      <li><a href=\"https://snyk.io/redirect/github/evanw/esbuild/commit/6b9737a67f1ae51cea68c830937004a2031f96e6\">6b9737a</a> fix test262 crash in v8 due to renamed test</li>\n      <li><a href=\"https://snyk.io/redirect/github/evanw/esbuild/commit/0d9f7652efb71f2c0cfc0b6ccbe5796c9dddc66a\">0d9f765</a> fix #3230, fix #3326, fix #3394: update decorators</li>\n      <li><a href=\"https://snyk.io/redirect/github/evanw/esbuild/commit/9fc1ed379c82645a656ec0cce534c27f244a658d\">9fc1ed3</a> ast helpers: use a context object</li>\n      <li><a href=\"https://snyk.io/redirect/github/evanw/esbuild/commit/00fa0107ed4fd2b363e2fa3cd2160aeb2f787fc3\">00fa010</a> tree shaking: handle destructuring of an array</li>\n      <li><a href=\"https://snyk.io/redirect/github/evanw/esbuild/commit/f361c7fe557586aa696b5db262b724ce6b241aa0\">f361c7f</a> fix #3477: forbid &#x60;--keep-names&#x60;
