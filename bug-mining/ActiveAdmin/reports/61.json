The scope I have by default for admins is different from my intern role, since the admins will have access to much more information.\n\n``` ruby\nActiveAdmin.register User do\n  scope :all, :default => proc{current_user.intern?}\n  scope :business_users, :default => proc{current_user.admin?}\n  scope :super_users\n  scope_to :current_user, association_method: :managed_users\n```\n\nI'm trying to do something like above, which doesn't work. The reason why I don't want to make :all default for both roles is that for Users, we're looking to have easily thousands/tens of thousands that are viewable by the admin. The intern role, however will not due to the scope_to.\n\nAnd I'm going to hide the unnecessary scopes from the intern role. Right now, if I do that, then the default has to be on a scope that has information for the intern (which is :all).\n","closed_by":{"login":"macfanatic","id":162970,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2Mjk3MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/162970?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/macfanatic","html_url":"https://github.com/macfanatic","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/macfanatic/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/macfanatic/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/macfanatic/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/macfanatic/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/macfanatic/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/macfanatic/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/macfanatic/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/macfanatic/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/macfanatic/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/activeadmin/activeadmin/issues/1670/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/activeadmin/activeadmin/issues/1670/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
