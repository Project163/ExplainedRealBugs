 First I wanted to say thanks for making such a great gem.  AA is really awesome.\n\nYesterday I discovered some really odd behavior when dealing with renamed resources.\n\nI have 2 models, users:\n\n```\nActiveAdmin.register User do\n...\nend\n```\n\nand then invites.  I am using devise_invitable which adds columns to the users table for invites, so I did the following\n\n```\nActiveAdmin.register User, :as => \"Invite\" do\n...\nend\n```\n\nAll seems correct but I noticed if the \"invites\" get loaded before the \"users\" then active admin goes into a really bad state.  Users never shows up in the menu and routing gets trampled.  References to the users admin page return undefined methods:\n\n```\nundefined method `admin_user_path' for #<ActiveAdmin::Views::IndexAsTable:0x007f9d08673ca0>).   \n```\n\nHere is an example with screenshots:\n\nWorking:\n![users___groundfloor_and_user_invites rb__developers](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/4898672/1334171/4958b08a-35a4-11e3-81a6-a397c2403341.png)\n\nNot
