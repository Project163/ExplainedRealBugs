Rails app has been working great with ActiveAdmin..but now i am facing an issue ..which seems very hard to resolve.\r\n\r\nThe only reason i can see is my Gemfile.\r\n`gem 'activeadmin', github: 'activeadmin'`\r\n\r\nwhich always points to master,when i took a look at the previous working app..it had version of `1.0.0.pre2` and now it has `pre5`.Should i use a version number or Is there a fix for this issue.?\r\n\r\nany help will be appreciated\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nActionView::Template::Error (undefined method `order_clause' for #<ActiveAdmin::Page:0x0000000971c650>):\r\n    1: insert_tag
