folks, I've ran into a problem where serialization in Xamarin/Mono is exhibiting different behaviour from .NET. In my case, I have:\n\n```\npublic class A<T>\n{\n  public virtual IList<T> Property { get; set; }\n}\n\npublic class B : A<C>\n{\n  [JsonProperty(PropertyName=\"Name\")]\n  public virtual IList<C> Property {get; set;}\n}\n\npublic class C {\n  public string Name => \"Bob\";\n}\n```\n\nSerializing B in .NET generates the appropriate object \n\n```\n{\n  \"Name\":[{\"Name\":\"Bob\"}]\n}\n```\n\n but Serializing B under Mono generates a duplicate property like so:\n\n```\n{\n  \"Name\":[{\"Name\":\"Bob\"}]\n  \"Property\":[{\"Name\":\"Bob\"}]\n}\n```\n\nI've confirmed that the problem is rooted in differences in reflection by comparing the ContractResolver instance cache's property data for class `B` between .NET and Mono. In the latter it has an extra entry for `Property` with the property name `Property` as declared by type `A`, in addition to the entry for `Property` with property name `Name` as declared by type `B`.\n\nI'm under deadline and will be working around this problem, but wanted to put it on your radar. I'll see if I can take some time to create a sample project in Mono to duplicate this problem.\n\nThis may be related to Issue #726 .\n\nPackages:\nNewtonsoft.Json, Version 8.0.3\nXamarin.Forms, Version 2.2.0.31\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/JamesNK/Newtonsoft.Json/issues/897/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/JamesNK/Newtonsoft.Json/issues/897/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
