There are 2 issues with the current implementation that should be addressed.\n\nFirst, when searching for an assembly that was dynamically loaded to the current app domain it checks only for a match with a fully qualified assembly name instead of also for a match with the partial name which is the default output of Json.NET.\n\nSecondly, if the type is generic and one of it's generic type parameters is defined within a separate dynamically loaded assembly it will fail to resolve the type. Instead, when it fails to find the type and it determines that the type is generic it should retrieve the generic type definition and then parse the type parameters in a recursive way and resolve the closed type using the MakeGenericType method.\n\nI have done both of these in my custom SerializationBinder but believe this behavior should be included in the DefaultSerializationBinder. I'd gladly submit a pull request for this if you agree this should be done.\n","closed_by":{"login":"JamesNK","id":303201,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwMzIwMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/303201?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JamesNK","html_url":"https://github.com/JamesNK","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JamesNK/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JamesNK/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JamesNK/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JamesNK/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JamesNK/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JamesNK/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JamesNK/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JamesNK/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JamesNK/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/JamesNK/Newtonsoft.Json/issues/926/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/JamesNK/Newtonsoft.Json/issues/926/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
