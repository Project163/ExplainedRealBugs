We need to support re-resolution of DNS names when the JVM is configured to do so.\r\n\r\n## References\r\n- see **InetAddress Caching** under https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/net/InetAddress.html","closed_by":{"login":"hft-team-city","id":7127206,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcxMjcyMDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7127206?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hft-team-city","html_url":"https://github.com/hft-team-city","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hft-team-city/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hft-team-city/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hft-team-city/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hft-team-city/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hft-team-city/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hft-team-city/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hft-team-city/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hft-team-city/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hft-team-city/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenHFT/Chronicle-Network/issues/168/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenHFT/Chronicle-Network/issues/168/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
