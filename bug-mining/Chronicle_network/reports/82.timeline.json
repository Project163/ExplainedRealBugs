@nicktindall Is there any more to do for this issue?\r\n\r\nI made a fix in Queue Enterprise which fixes the problem specifically when the ServerThreadingStrategy is not CONCURRENT. Which is an improvement, because I tried and its reasonably difficult to use CONCURRENT (you need to override the default EventGroup).\r\n\r\nThe problem in general is still there, and I'm not sure how to fix it generally. The issue is the TcpEventHandler manages the NetworkContext so if you call ConnectionManager.addListener and it ends up being executed synchronously on the calling thread there's a chance you'll be provided with a NetworkContext that is in the process of being closed.\r\n\r\nThere is an example of how to do this in a thread-safe manner [here](https://github.com/OpenHFT/Chronicle-Threads/blob/0ea446c474bbf23551f211eec09052fe002190d3/src/main/java/net/openhft/chronicle/threads/MediumEventLoop.java#L220) but its a bit more complicated in the case of the ConnectionManager because there's a chance that the ServerThreadingStrategy is CONCURRENT and each of the NetworkContexts is \"owned\" by a different

#109 \r\n\r\n## Main points\r\n- State required for idempotency moved out of ConnectionManager (would have been a small(?) memory leak previously)\r\n- Will work with any ServerThreadingStrategy (including concurrent)\r\n- Checks for new listeners should be fast in the event there are none (just an integer comparison, synchronized block only entered if there are new listeners to execute)\r\n- onConnectionChanged should now only enter synchronized block if the state has actually changed\r\n\r\n## Note to reviewers\r\nOne thing that I thought might be a risk was this implementation associates the state required for idempotency with the UberHandler (the `eventEmitterToken` field), where previously the last known state was stored in a map keyed by `NetworkContext`. If a single `NetworkContext` was able to be associated with multiple `UberHandlers` (simultaneously or sequentially) then that would be a change in behaviour, and potentially not idempotent. But from what I can see this is not the case and `UberHandlers` are 1:1 with
