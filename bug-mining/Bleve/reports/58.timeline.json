The index sub-package does expose such functionality through the FieldReader interface.  This lets you iterate through all terms used in a particular field in the index.  Currently its only used by the fuzzy search implementation internally.\n\nThe reason I did not directly expose this yet at the top-level is that I thought users would actually want a more proper Suggestion interface, and not access the terms directly.  I'm not opposed to adding it if there is a good reason to do so, but I don't want bloat the API with this if a suggestion API is what you really want.\n\nCan you share how you plan on using the terms?

I've given it a lot of thought, and implemented a few things I didn't like enough to push.\n\nI've decided now that there is a lot of utility in having access to the terms (and their frequency) outside of bleve.  Mainly this is because even for suggestion interfaces you often want to supplement the data, or augment scoring with other information (like search logs).\n\nSo I'm now in the process of wiring this up.  Its not quite as simple as I'd like because our row encoding format doesn't give us terms in lexigraphical order (needed by many, but not all consumers of this data)\n","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/blevesearch/bleve/issues/comments/66813196/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"mschoch","id":298143,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5ODE0Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/298143?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mschoch","html_url":"https://github.com/mschoch","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mschoch/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mschoch/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mschoch/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mschoch/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mschoch/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mschoch/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mschoch/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mschoch/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mschoch/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":249638077,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MjQ5NjM4MDc3","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/blevesearch/bleve/issues/events/249638077","actor":{"login":"mschoch","id":298143,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5ODE0Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/298143?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mschoch","html_url":"https://github.com/mschoch","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mschoch/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mschoch/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mschoch/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mschoch/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mschoch/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mschoch/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mschoch/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mschoch/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mschoch/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":"522f9d5cc7cf698cf9e0d288ea4a04b45489d4fd","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/blevesearch/bleve/commits/522f9d5cc7cf698cf9e0d288ea4a04b45489d4fd","created_at":"2015-03-10T20:25:54Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/blevesearch/bleve/issues/comments/78140850","html_url":"https://github.com/blevesearch/bleve/issues/127#issuecomment-78140850","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/blevesearch/bleve/issues/127","id":78140850,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc4MTQwODUw","user":{"login":"mschoch","id":298143,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5ODE0Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/298143?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mschoch","html_url":"https://github.com/mschoch","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mschoch/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mschoch/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mschoch/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mschoch/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mschoch/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mschoch/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mschoch/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mschoch/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mschoch/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-03-10T20:27:36Z","updated_at":"2015-03-10T20:27:36Z","body":"The new methods available on the Index interface to support enumerating terms used in a field are:\n\n```\n    FieldDict(field string) (index.FieldDict, error)\n    FieldDictRange(field string, startTerm []byte, endTerm []byte) (index.FieldDict, error)\n    FieldDictPrefix(field string, termPrefix []byte) (index.FieldDict, error)\n```\n\nThese all return an index.FieldDict interface, which returns terms using the Next() method.
