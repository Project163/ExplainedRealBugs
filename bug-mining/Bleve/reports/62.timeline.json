It will work much like the simple implementation we have of Fuzzy search today.\n\nMy reasons for not making it higher priority are:\n1.  Its not particularly fast.  We basically have to have to enumerate (sometimes large) sections of the dictionary to find terms matching the pattern.\n2.  In my experience, normal users don't think in terms of wildcards the way developers do.  So, when I talk to other engineers, they always want wildcards, but when I talk to other people, it doesn't come up.  For normal users, having good text analysis and possibly some fuzziness, you can usually match what they're looking for.\n\nAll that said, I'm not saying we don't need wildcard support, just that it hasn't been highest priority.\n\nIf this is something you wanted to take a crack at here is how I would approach it.\n1.  Copy search_fuzzy.go over to search_wildcard.go\n2.  Write a function that builds a golang regexp from the wildcard expression.\n3.  Change the code to use this function to check terms for a match instead of the levenshtein distance.\n4.  Optimization -- if the wildcard pattern has a non-wildcard prefix, we can use this when enumerating the terms to greatly cut-down the number of terms we have to look at.\n","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/blevesearch/bleve/issues/comments/72946032/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"mschoch","id":298143,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5ODE0Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/298143?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mschoch","html_url":"https://github.com/mschoch","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mschoch/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mschoch/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mschoch/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mschoch/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mschoch/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mschoch/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mschoch/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mschoch/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mschoch/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":250442446,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MjUwNDQyNDQ2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/blevesearch/bleve/issues/events/250442446","actor":{"login":"mschoch","id":298143,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5ODE0Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/298143?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mschoch","html_url":"https://github.com/mschoch","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mschoch/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mschoch/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mschoch/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mschoch/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mschoch/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mschoch/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mschoch/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mschoch/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mschoch/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":"a41f229b14679e3377f5569629a78c72b7266842","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/blevesearch/bleve/commits/a41f229b14679e3377f5569629a78c72b7266842","created_at":"2015-03-11T20:58:12Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
