At the time had proposed a new method to create in-memory only indexes.\n\nI'm a bit reluctant to add a new method for this as it seems a bit wasteful to me.  But I agree that it is not obvious, and many users have asked this question (most recently from @AlexanderDaw on gitter).\n\nMy proposal is to add a constant to the bleve package, like:\n\n```\nconst InMemory = \"\"\n```\n\nThen the code to create a new in-memory index would look like:\n\n```\nindex, err := bleve.New(bleve.InMemory, NewIndexMapping())\n```\n\nI think this does address the issue of code readability, but I'm willing to consider other ideas.\n\nThoughts?\n","closed_by":{"login":"mschoch","id":298143,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5ODE0Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/298143?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mschoch","html_url":"https://github.com/mschoch","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mschoch/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mschoch/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mschoch/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mschoch/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mschoch/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mschoch/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mschoch/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mschoch/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mschoch/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/blevesearch/bleve/issues/427/reactions","total_count":3,"+1":3,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/blevesearch/bleve/issues/427/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
