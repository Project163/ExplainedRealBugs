provide a method for people to side-step the issue where other options are infeasible.\n\nIf you were to also introduce a new classifier, I'd strongly recommend deprecating the old one so that it can be phased out, since there may also be a method conflict on `Type()`, where the return value might be unacceptable as a doc type
