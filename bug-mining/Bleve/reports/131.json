The IndexSnapshot and Segment's are intended to be immutable and safe for multiple reader threads.  Of note, a zap Segment has a map of docValueReaders...\r\n\r\n  fieldDvReaders map[uint16]*docValueReader\r\n\r\nBut, it looks like a docValueReader has mutable state, where it has curChunkNum/curChunkData fields.  See the loadDvChunk() method here...\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/blevesearch/bleve/blob/master/index/scorch/segment/zap/docvalues.go#L116\r\n\r\nThis can cause problems if multiple threads are concurrently accessing the doc values.","closed_by":{"login":"steveyen","id":30640,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwNjQw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/30640?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveyen","html_url":"https://github.com/steveyen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveyen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveyen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveyen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveyen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveyen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveyen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveyen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveyen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveyen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/blevesearch/bleve/issues/893/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/blevesearch/bleve/issues/893/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
