In this mode we only index the fields that you explicitly map.

You just have to configure the appropriate datetime parser.  If you didn't provide an explicit mapping for the field, we first try to parse it with the default datetime_parser.  If that succeeds its indexed as a datetime.  If that fails we proceed to just index it as a string.

I think I eventually stumbled across the float64 restriction in the mailing list.\nMaybe an error should be set if an explicitly-defined fieldmapping encounters a datatype it doesn't handle? (although I realise it could be fiddly distinguishing between explicitly-set and default fieldmappings). I'll have a bit of a poke about in the code and see if I can come up with some more concrete thoughts.\n\nThanks for pointing out the custom datetime parsing (the `DateFormat` field in `FieldMapping`, I assume) - I'd missed that!\n","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/blevesearch/bleve/issues/comments/127688926/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"bcampbell","id":99150,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk5MTUw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/99150?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bcampbell","html_url":"https://github.com/bcampbell","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bcampbell/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bcampbell/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bcampbell/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bcampbell/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bcampbell/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bcampbell/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bcampbell/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bcampbell/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bcampbell/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/blevesearch/bleve/issues/comments/127689960","html_url":"https://github.com/blevesearch/bleve/issues/106#issuecomment-127689960","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/blevesearch/bleve/issues/106","id":127689960,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEyNzY4OTk2MA==","user":{"login":"mschoch","id":298143,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5ODE0Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/298143?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mschoch","html_url":"https://github.com/mschoch","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mschoch/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mschoch/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mschoch/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mschoch/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mschoch/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mschoch/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mschoch/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mschoch/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mschoch/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-08-04T17:48:02Z","updated_at":"2015-08-04T17:48:02Z","body":"Yep, great point.
