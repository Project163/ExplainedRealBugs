The reason is that when we rewrite this to a BooleanQuery, there are no MUST or SHOULD clauses, and this violates a pre-condition of the BooleanQuery.\n\nWhen I originally ported this from Lucene I thought this was the corresponding behavior.  However, after this issue was raised on the bleve list, I checked Elasticsearch, and I observe different behavior.
