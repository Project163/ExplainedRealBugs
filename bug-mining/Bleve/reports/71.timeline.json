Though there is no guarantee this will always be the case.\n\nOne sort of hackish solution is to not fail on the first error, keep a list of the ones that failed and try them again after defining the others.  Then go through the list of failures with the same process.  And keep going as long as the list of errors is getting shorter.  If you ever go through the loop and don't make progress then there is some unsatisfied dependency.\n\nOr, we could have a more strongly typed error indicating the name of the thing we depended on that we couldn't find, and then we could immediately see if we have some way to resolve that.  Thats a bit cleaner, but only works for first level dependency issues.\n","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/blevesearch/bleve/issues/comments/101462624/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"mschoch","id":298143,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5ODE0Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/298143?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mschoch","html_url":"https://github.com/mschoch","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mschoch/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mschoch/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mschoch/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mschoch/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mschoch/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mschoch/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mschoch/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mschoch/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mschoch/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":304879394,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MzA0ODc5Mzk0","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/blevesearch/bleve/issues/events/304879394","actor":{"login":"mschoch","id":298143,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5ODE0Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/298143?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mschoch","html_url":"https://github.com/mschoch","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mschoch/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mschoch/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mschoch/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mschoch/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mschoch/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mschoch/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mschoch/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mschoch/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mschoch/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":"580d9013b213a318194b6e844d693cad9c49aff7","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/blevesearch/bleve/commits/580d9013b213a318194b6e844d693cad9c49aff7","created_at":"2015-05-14T13:51:01Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
