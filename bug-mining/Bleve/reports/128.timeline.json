 If a bug is left open, then generally that means we intend to fix it.\r\n\r\n2.  What you've proposed is more of a workaround than a solution, because there is a deeper problem.  Is the contents of the request (containing []string) intended to be immutable?  Probably yes, and the searcher currently violates this, but this is just one known instance, we may have others or introduce others in the future if we don't think about this and clarify it. Second, by applying this specific change, we copy the slice in a cases, even when it is the only one being sorted.  And in cases where there are multiple shards, we end up copying and sorting each copy of the list, when ideally we would just sort it up front.  Then we don't even need to copy it because the sorting was the only reason to mutate it in the first place.  But, there is no convenient place to put this logic either unless we hard-code some ID search logic inside the multi-search method.  So, that is the reason we did not rush ahead with a quick fix like this.\r\n\r\nHowever, I sense no strong momentum to figure out a proper fix, so I will code up a workaround like this
