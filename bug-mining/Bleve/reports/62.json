I need wildcards for this to work properly\". Sigh.\n\nAny chance the priority of wildcard implementation could be moved up? Even if the initial implementation is only \"_\" and it can only be at the end of a partial term, i.e.  \"_foo\"  not allowed, but \"foo*\" allowed.\n\nCould you indicate when wildcards might be implemented?  (Sorry, no pressure!)  :-)\n\nAnd yes, I owe you a beer!  :-)\n","closed_by":{"login":"mschoch","id":298143,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5ODE0Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/298143?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mschoch","html_url":"https://github.com/mschoch","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mschoch/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mschoch/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mschoch/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mschoch/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mschoch/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mschoch/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mschoch/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mschoch/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mschoch/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/blevesearch/bleve/issues/152/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/blevesearch/bleve/issues/152/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
