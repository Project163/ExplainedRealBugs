Folding Filter reimplemented in Go based on Lucene's AsciiFoldingFilter.\r\n\r\n**Notice:** It does fold German Umlauts `ä -> a` and **not** `ä -> ae` like mentioned in the referenced issue. Reason for that is to keep the filter generic for all languages and work the same way as the Lucene implementation.\r\nBy adding a few regexp filters to the chain (before this Ascii folding filter), above umlaut filtering can easily be achieved.\r\n\r\nfixes #957 ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/blevesearch/bleve/issues/1070/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/blevesearch/bleve/issues/1070/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":2014530430,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MjAxNDUzMDQzMA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/blevesearch/bleve/issues/events/2014530430","actor":{"login":"abhinavdangeti","id":1863456,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NjM0NTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1863456?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/abhinavdangeti","html_url":"https://github.com/abhinavdangeti","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abhinavdangeti/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abhinavdangeti/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abhinavdangeti/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abhinavdangeti/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abhinavdangeti/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abhinavdangeti/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abhinavdangeti/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abhinavdangeti/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abhinavdangeti/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-12-09T19:31:21Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
