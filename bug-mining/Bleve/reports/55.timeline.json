The problem we have is that \"took\" is not really the full search time anyway, its just the time it took to find/score results.\n\nSo, I could change the alias code to produce a more meaningful value (by say timing how long it takes to query all the constituents).  But, then its a fundamentally different metric than what is returned for non-aliased indexes.\n\nI think first we should agree on what \"took\" should mean, and then apply it to all implementations.\n","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/blevesearch/bleve/issues/comments/74854071/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"mschoch","id":298143,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5ODE0Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/298143?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mschoch","html_url":"https://github.com/mschoch","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mschoch/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mschoch/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mschoch/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mschoch/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mschoch/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mschoch/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mschoch/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mschoch/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mschoch/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":238193440,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MjM4MTkzNDQw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/blevesearch/bleve/issues/events/238193440","actor":{"login":"mschoch","id":298143,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5ODE0Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/298143?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mschoch","html_url":"https://github.com/mschoch","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mschoch/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mschoch/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mschoch/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mschoch/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mschoch/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mschoch/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mschoch/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mschoch/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mschoch/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":"0771f813ce27f58e001d9ea0ceba1e4afc180146","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/blevesearch/bleve/commits/0771f813ce27f58e001d9ea0ceba1e4afc180146","created_at":"2015-02-19T06:42:50Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
