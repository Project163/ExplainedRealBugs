read-only capability of Bleve, when using the upsidedown index type (default) is provided by the underlying K/V store.  This support sometimes has limitations.  In the case of BoltDB, the documentation is clear:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/etcd-io/bbolt#read-only-mode\r\n\r\nWhen opening BoltDB in read-only mode, a shared-lock is acquired.  This means you could have multiple processes open the index in read-only mode at the same time, but NO process will be able to open it in read-write mode until all the read-only instances have exited.\r\n\r\nThe situation isn't yet any better with the scorch index-type, but there is hope to fix it one day (still uses BoltDB internally for managing some metadata).  Essentially, Bleve was not designed to support multiple processes working with the index data.  It's something we can eventually fix, but it requires many other things be cleaned up
