I imagine 3 cases:\n1- Debugging. No problem, you can just hack bleve source code and revert later\n2- Exploring low level data stored in the index. Obviously depends on the index structure, so no big deal if such tools break when the index changes. These tools are useful to understand how the index works, how it interacts with the backend and \"feel\" the dataset size. They also lead to [3].\n3- Explore high level properties of the index. The term histogram may belongs to this category, it helps tuning the analysis process and gives domain specific information about the dataset. And that regardless of the index structure. It might be worth adding and supporting dedicated APIs to expose such features.\n\nMy small frustration with [2] is I see no good reason to hide the internal index structure, provided it is advertized as completely unstable. But hiding it hampers exploration which might lead to [3].\n\nFor now I have reverted my local changes and partially reimplemented the key/value decoding logic, so I have a workaround.\n","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/blevesearch/bleve/issues/comments/153454294/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"pmezard","id":1430779,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MzA3Nzk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1430779?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pmezard","html_url":"https://github.com/pmezard","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pmezard/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pmezard/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pmezard/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pmezard/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pmezard/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pmezard/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pmezard/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pmezard/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pmezard/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/blevesearch/bleve/issues/comments/153455465","html_url":"https://github.com/blevesearch/bleve/issues/268#issuecomment-153455465","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/blevesearch/bleve/issues/268","id":153455465,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE1MzQ1NTQ2NQ==","user":{"login":"mschoch","id":298143,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5ODE0Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/298143?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mschoch","html_url":"https://github.com/mschoch","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mschoch/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mschoch/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mschoch/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mschoch/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mschoch/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mschoch/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mschoch/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mschoch/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mschoch/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-11-03T19:03:24Z","updated_at":"2015-11-03T19:03:24Z","body":"I'm not saying we have to hide it.
