The only reservation I have is that sometimes these really generic interfaces get used for different/multiple purposes.  So, today it solves your problem, but then tomorrow someone has a structure that uses TextMarshaler in a different way, and they really do want to index the contents of the structure itself.  We already encountered a similar problem by using the json struct tags to set field names, but in some cases users wanted the Bleve field names to be different than their JSON field names.\n\nAnother question I wonder, what is special about TextMarshaler, why not Stringer?  I can certainly think of a lot more counter-examples where Stringer is not what you want to index, but to me that just emphasizes the point.  Why do we think the output of TextMarshaler is suitable for indexing?\n","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/blevesearch/bleve/issues/comments/157763879/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"mschoch","id":298143,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5ODE0Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/298143?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mschoch","html_url":"https://github.com/mschoch","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mschoch/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mschoch/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mschoch/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mschoch/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mschoch/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mschoch/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mschoch/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mschoch/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mschoch/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/blevesearch/bleve/issues/comments/157800143","html_url":"https://github.com/blevesearch/bleve/issues/281#issuecomment-157800143","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/blevesearch/bleve/issues/281","id":157800143,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE1NzgwMDE0Mw==","user":{"login":"mmindenhall","id":1106269,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMDYyNjk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1106269?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmindenhall","html_url":"https://github.com/mmindenhall","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmindenhall/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmindenhall/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmindenhall/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmindenhall/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmindenhall/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmindenhall/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmindenhall/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmindenhall/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmindenhall/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-11-18T17:53:02Z","updated_at":"2015-11-18T17:53:02Z","body":"A few thoughts.  \n\nSure, these interfaces can get used in all sorts of strange ways, but I think the package descriptions shed some light.\n\nTextMarshaler is within the encoding package, intended to \"convert data to and from byte-level and textual representations\".  So it seems that when implementing this interface, more care should be taken to define a correct and concise text encoding for the type.  \n\nStringer is in the fmt package, intended for \"formatted I/O with functions analogous to C's printf and scanf\".  I think Stringer is most commonly used to produce human-readable output (e.g., for debugging), and less thought goes into the format/representation of the data.  Usually (at least for me), it's good enough if I can use it to determine something about the state of the system at some point in execution.\n\nMaybe someone out there is using TextMarshaler already in a different way, and introducing this support would break their search index.  In that case, perhaps it could be treated similar to an Analyzer, which has a default that can be overridden at the IndexMapping, DocumentMapping, or FieldMapping?  For the reasons given above, I think TextMarshaler should be the default, unless explicitly overridden.  Also, if TextMarshaler isn't implemented, obviously the current Stringer behavior should apply.\n","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/blevesearch/bleve/issues/comments/157800143/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"mmindenhall","id":1106269,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMDYyNjk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1106269?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmindenhall","html_url":"https://github.com/mmindenhall","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmindenhall/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmindenhall/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmindenhall/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmindenhall/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmindenhall/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmindenhall/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmindenhall/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmindenhall/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mmindenhall/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/blevesearch/bleve/issues/comments/157805901","html_url":"https://github.com/blevesearch/bleve/issues/281#issuecomment-157805901","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/blevesearch/bleve/issues/281","id":157805901,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE1NzgwNTkwMQ==","user":{"login":"mschoch","id":298143,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5ODE0Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/298143?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mschoch","html_url":"https://github.com/mschoch","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mschoch/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mschoch/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mschoch/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mschoch/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mschoch/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mschoch/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mschoch/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mschoch/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mschoch/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-11-18T18:11:08Z","updated_at":"2015-11-18T18:11:08Z","body":"Yeah, I'm inclined to agree, but I think we'll need some way to override it in the mapping as you suggest.\n\nJust to be clear, there is no current behavior for Stringer, in fact I think it would break most use cases if we did.

you have structs which contain data which isn't\r\nexported, or for which the correct data to index isn't just the\r\ncontents of it's exported fields.  In these cases your struct\r\ncan implement TextMarshaler to return a suitable text\r\nrepresentation.\r\n\r\nPreviously bleve did not recognize this interface and do anything\r\nto use it.  Now, if the field containing such a struct is\r\nexplicitly mapped as \"text\" and if the struct (or pointer to it)\r\nimplements TextMarshaler, we index a text field with the\r\ncontents returned by MarshalText().\r\n\r\nFor backwards compatibilty, dynamic mappings will never use\r\nthis feature, and will continue to traverse into the struct\r\nand index the exported fields directly.\r\n\r\nfixes

the field is not a pointer (time.Time) things work fine.\r\n\r\nThe problem arises due to special case handling added to support encoding.TextMarshaler (see #281).  A field of type *time.Time does satisfy the encoding.TextMarshaler interface, which triggers the special logic.  This logic then gets the text produced by MarshalText() method, and if there is no error AND if this field has an explicit mapping OF TYPE TEXT, it is indexed correctly.\r\n\r\nHowever, if the user had specified an explicit mapping of type DateTime (likely) the field ends up dropped.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/blevesearch/bleve/issues/1152/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/blevesearch/bleve/issues/1152/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
