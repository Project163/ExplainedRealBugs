The typical answer is that your generated code should be properly formatted too. You can achieve this by either modifying the generator to directly produce well-formatted code, or by running the formatter after it, like:\r\n\r\n```\r\n//go:generate some-generator -out gen.go\r\n//go:generate gofumpt -w gen.go\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, I'm having second thoughts given the proposed feature to split long lines in #2. Long lines in a generated file aren't necessarily a bad thing, especially when generated files are bundling binary data or assets.\r\n\r\nOne possible solution here is to skip any file that has the magic `Code generated by` comment near the top. However, that could be counter-intuitive; running `gofumpt -w gen.go` might not do anything just because that file has that special comment. Perhaps we can add this restriction only when formatting entire directories.","author_association":"OWNER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mvdan/gofumpt/issues/comments/627912942/reactions","total_count":3,"+1":3,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"mvdan","id":3576549,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1NzY1NDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3576549?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mvdan","html_url":"https://github.com/mvdan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mvdan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mvdan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mvdan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mvdan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mvdan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mvdan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mvdan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mvdan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mvdan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":3331547497,"node_id":"MDE3OlJlbmFtZWRUaXRsZUV2ZW50MzMzMTU0NzQ5Nw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mvdan/gofumpt/issues/events/3331547497","actor":{"login":"mvdan","id":3576549,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1NzY1NDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3576549?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mvdan","html_url":"https://github.com/mvdan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mvdan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mvdan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mvdan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mvdan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mvdan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mvdan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mvdan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mvdan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mvdan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"renamed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-05-13T11:09:43Z","rename":{"from":"How
