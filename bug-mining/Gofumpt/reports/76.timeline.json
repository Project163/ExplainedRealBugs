For example:\r\n\r\n```\r\n//go:generate some-generator -o out.go\r\n//go:generate gofumpt -w out.go\r\n```\r\n\r\nThat is what I would personally do. It does add an automated step to your `go generate`, but the end result is nice and doesn't require any special cases or custom configuration.\r\n\r\n> Taking file path input from a (temporary) file would also work for us, that would be welcome to have.\r\n\r\nDoing it seems like a good idea in any case.

We do already skip `vendor` directories unless they are explicitly given, so perhaps we could do the same for `node_modules`, with the assumption that it wouldn't be a regression for existing users or for users who come from `gofmt`.

Similarly, the added rules do not apply to generated Go files unless they are given as explicit arguments.\r\n\r\nThe magic string is https://github.com/mvdan/gofumpt/blob/3d971cbff40ecf22e0488b299a26fa66bb175604/gofmt.go#L117\r\n\r\n@weeco like you point out, your case is broken by design: it's likely that many other existing Go tools, like `gofmt -l .` or `go build ./...`, would similarly get confused by the not-actually-Go file. I'd suggest filing the issue upstream in the project that wants that file to exist.\r\n\r\n> I'm sure there are more legitimate usecases which would benefit from an exclude parameter.\r\n\r\nThe only other use case mentioned here is generated files, which is already handled per the above. If Go tools in general come up with a standard in https://github.com/golang/go/issues/42965, I'll be happy to follow. I'm reluctant to make up my own standard in the meantime.","author_association":"OWNER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mvdan/gofumpt/issues/comments/1348191229/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":1,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"mvdan","id":3576549,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1NzY1NDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3576549?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mvdan","html_url":"https://github.com/mvdan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mvdan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mvdan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mvdan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mvdan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mvdan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mvdan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mvdan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mvdan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mvdan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":8024160765,"node_id":"MEE_lADOCqWoQc5UM2dozwAAAAHeRvn9","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mvdan/gofumpt/issues/events/8024160765","actor":{"login":"silverwind","id":115237,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTIzNw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/115237?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/silverwind","html_url":"https://github.com/silverwind","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/silverwind/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/silverwind/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/silverwind/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/silverwind/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/silverwind/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/silverwind/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/silverwind/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/silverwind/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/silverwind/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-12-13T11:02:01Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":8024160784,"node_id":"SE_lADOCqWoQc5UM2dozwAAAAHeRvoQ","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mvdan/gofumpt/issues/events/8024160784","actor":{"login":"silverwind","id":115237,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTIzNw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/115237?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/silverwind","html_url":"https://github.com/silverwind","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/silverwind/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/silverwind/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/silverwind/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/silverwind/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/silverwind/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/silverwind/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/silverwind/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/silverwind/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/silverwind/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-12-13T11:02:01Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":8024160802,"node_id":"MEE_lADOCqWoQc5UM2dozwAAAAHeRvoi","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mvdan/gofumpt/issues/events/8024160802","actor":{"login":"weeco","id":23424570,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzNDI0NTcw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/23424570?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/weeco","html_url":"https://github.com/weeco","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weeco/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weeco/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weeco/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weeco/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weeco/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weeco/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weeco/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weeco/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weeco/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-12-13T11:02:01Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":8024160814,"node_id":"SE_lADOCqWoQc5UM2dozwAAAAHeRvou","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mvdan/gofumpt/issues/events/8024160814","actor":{"login":"weeco","id":23424570,"node_id":"MDQ6

The summary of the accepted proposal at: https://github.com/golang/go/issues/42965#issuecomment-1974089649.\r\n\r\n- - -\r\n\r\n\r\n## Problem\r\n\r\nFor non-trivial (often multi-language) projects it's often desirable to make all the Go tools (including `gopls`) ignore certain directories.\r\n\r\nSome of the examples could be the huge amount of files within `node_modules`, or `bazel-*` directories generated by Bazel. This causes many operations with `./...` wildcards taking longer than desired. Also `gopls` often eats up a lot of CPU in VS Code depending on what you are doing.\r\n\r\n## Prior Art\r\n\r\nThis is something that has been discussed in several issues before, but seems like people couldn't get agree on a solution.\r\n\r\n- https://github.com/golang/go/issues/30058\r\n- https://github.com/golang/go/issues/35914\r\n- https://github.com/golang/go/issues/42473\r\n\r\nSome tools started to have their own solutions which causes fragmentation and is cumbersome.\r\n\r\nFor example `goimports` have its own machinery for this - `.goimportsignore` file in this case. But it's not working with Go Modules.\r\n\r\nOther tools have a hard-coded list of directories to ignore, like `.git` and so on.\r\n\r\nIt seems like having a global solution that all the Go ecosystem could understand would make sense to solve this kind of problem.\r\n\r\nRecently a workaround for this was to place a dummy `go.mod` file in the directories you wanted to ignore. But this is not easily portable between users of the project, because often these directories can be re-created on the user's machine and aren't even checked-in. Asking people to sprinkle some `go.mod` files all around every time is cumbersome.\r\n\r\n@robpike was against of creating more dot files (https://github.com/golang/go/issues/30058#issuecomment-475003231).\r\n\r\n## Proposed Solution\r\n\r\nHere're some of the options that this could be implemented with.\r\n\r\n1. ~~Use `go.mod` file for specifying directories to ignore.~~ (Rejected because `go.mod` is not a catch-all config file like `package.json` in NodeJS).\r\n2. ~~Use a separate `.goignore` file.~~ (This would go against Rob's desire to avoid new dot files, and although being in the spirit with other tools: `.dockerignore`, `.gitignore`, `.bazelignore`, etc. is concerning. The concerns are discussed in this thread).\r\n3. Use the `go.work` file that's coming in the next Go 1.18 release.\r\n4.
