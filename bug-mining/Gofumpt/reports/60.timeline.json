If this is your first pull request for Fyne please read the contributor docs at:\r\nhttps://github.com/fyne-io/fyne/wiki/Contributing.\r\nBe sure that your work is based off `develop` branch. --> \r\n\r\n### Description:\r\n<!-- A summary of the change included and which issue it addresses.\r\nPlease include any relevant motivation and background. -->\r\n\r\nI want to open this for various suggested changes regarding the linting we do as part of the CI checks. My suggestion is to replace `goimports` with [gofumpt](https://github.com/mvdan/gofumpt) and to stop using golint. As for the former, I think the stricter formatting is doing a great job (see diff for more info) and for the latter, it [has been deprecated](https://github.com/golang/lint/blob/master/README.md) for a while now. Most of what golint did (if not even everything) is handled by `go vet` and `staticcheck` already.\r\n\r\nThese changes should also make the static analysis quite a bit faster.\r\n\r\n### Checklist:\r\n<!-- Please tick these as appropriate using [x] -->\r\n\r\n- [ ] Tests included.\r\n- [x] Lint and formatter run with no errors.\r\n- [x] Tests all pass.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/fyne-io/fyne/issues/2855/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/fyne-io/fyne/issues/2855/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":6275051571,"node_id":"REFE_lADOCqWoQc5GAL8JzwAAAAF2BbAz","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mvdan/gofumpt/issues/events/6275051571","actor":{"login":"tsnewaz","id":17308333,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MzA4MzMz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17308333?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tsnewaz","html_url":"https://github.com/tsnewaz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tsnewaz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tsnewaz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tsnewaz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tsnewaz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tsnewaz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tsnewaz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tsnewaz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tsnewaz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tsnewaz/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"dad8329bf0042fb13ab50921878e4174855614ae","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tsnewaz/gofumpt/commits/dad8329bf0042fb13ab50921878e4174855614ae","created_at":"2022-03-21T12:23:54Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"actor":{"login":"tsnewaz","id":17308333,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MzA4MzMz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17308333?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tsnewaz","html_url":"https://github.com/tsnewaz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tsnewaz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tsnewaz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tsnewaz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tsnewaz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tsnewaz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tsnewaz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tsnewaz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tsnewaz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tsnewaz/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-03-21T12:24:29Z","updated_at":"2022-03-21T12:24:29Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mvdan/gofumpt/issues/214","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mvdan/gofumpt","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mvdan/gofumpt/issues/214/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mvdan/gofumpt/issues/214/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mvdan/gofumpt/issues/214/events","html_url":"https://github.com/mvdan/gofumpt/pull/214","id":1175307721,"node_id":"PR_kwDOCqWoQc40vGtJ","number":214,"title":"format:
