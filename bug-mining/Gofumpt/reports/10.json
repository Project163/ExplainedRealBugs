However, when I have only a single const that gets coalesced to `const foo = \"bar\"`, the per-block comment doesn't really apply to a block anymore:\r\n\r\n```diff\r\ndiff --git a/main.go b/main.go\r\nindex 283ba85..1e04736 100644\r\n--- a/main.go\r\n+++ b/main.go\r\n@@ -4,15 +4,13 @@ import \"fmt\"\r\n \r\n // All the things that can go wrong.\r\n // TODO: add more\r\n-const (\r\n-\tInvalidID = \"invalid ID number given\"\r\n-)\r\n+\r\n+const InvalidID = \"invalid ID number given\"\r\n \r\n // Message IDs that map to beautiful, long-winded status messages.\r\n // TODO: add more\r\n-const (\r\n-\tWelcomeBack = iota // Welcome the user back after a long time being away.\r\n-)\r\n+\r\n+const WelcomeBack = iota // Welcome the user back after a long time being away.\r\n \r\n func main() {\r\n \tfmt.Println(\"Hello, world!\")\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis leaves me with a floating comment per former block that no longer obviously applies to anything in particular:\r\n\r\n```go\r\npackage main\r\n\r\nimport \"fmt\"\r\n\r\n// All the things that can go wrong.\r\n// TODO: add more\r\n\r\nconst InvalidID = \"invalid ID number given\"\r\n\r\n// Message IDs that map to beautiful, long-winded status messages.\r\n// TODO: add more\r\n\r\nconst WelcomeBack = iota // Welcome the user back after a long time being away.\r\n\r\nfunc main() {\r\n\tfmt.Println(\"Hello, world!\")\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nI don't have much of a problem assigning to _ to temporarily silence unused-variable errors for fifteen minutes while I debug something.
