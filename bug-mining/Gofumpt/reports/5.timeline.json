far as I know, the main reason to support a fork of goimports was because multiple editor integrations only allow running gofmt or goimports, not both at the same time. Thus, if one wanted to use gofumpt while also getting the benefits of goimports, gofumports was useful.\r\n\r\nHowever, a lot has changed in the past year; gopls has come a long way, and most major editors have good gopls integrations by now. They will also add gofumpt soon: https://github.com/golang/go/issues/39805\r\n\r\nSo I see less reason to support a fork of goimports on top of a fork of gofmt. If someone really wants to get the best of both worlds from the command line, they can just run both tools one after the other, like: `goimports -l -w . && gofumpt -l -w .`\r\n\r\nThere are several advantages to dropping the goimports fork:\r\n\r\n* goimports is big and complex, making this module very large (I have to copy a dozen internal packages)\r\n* Given the point above, it's also extra work to maintain the project, especially in the long run\r\n* goimports is not a superset of gofmt; for example, the `-s` flag does not exist there, and we want to start enforcing it\r\n* Encouraging the use of a single formatter for all needs is a losing game - as long as gofumpt and goimports don't contradict each other, we are OK\r\n\r\nWill leave this issue open for a couple of weeks to see what others think. I'll wait for the gopls issue to be fixed and released, in any case.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mvdan/gofumpt/issues/75/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":0,"-1":1,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mvdan/gofumpt/issues/75/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
