It may even be technically infeasible for reasons I haven't been able to imagine yet. So this is as much an RFC as a proposal.\r\n\r\n## Proposal\r\n\r\nBut to the meat of the matter:  I'm proposing that `gofumpt` rewrite naked returns to no longer be naked.  I _think_ this can be a simple matter of copying the names of return values from the function signature to any naked return statements.  Example:\r\n\r\n```golang\r\nfunc sum(a, b int) (result int) {\r\n    result = a+b\r\n    return\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nwould be rewritten to:\r\n\r\n```golang\r\nfunc sum(a, b int) (result int) {\r\n    result = a+b\r\n    return result\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Rationale\r\n\r\nIMHO, naked returns are one of the worst features of Go.  I know I'm not alone in this, although I haven't done any sort of formal survey. For a language that values readability, this feature seemingly always goes against that ideal.  Granted, for trivially short functions (like my example above), the naked return doesn't _really_ hurt readability that much. The problems arise for much longer functions. But even in these short cases, adding the return result doesn't seem to hurt readability, either.\r\n\r\nThe only argument I can think of in favor of naked returns is the popular \"less typing\".  But by having a tool like `gofumpt` do this, those who like less typing can still have their way, without hurting readability.\r\n\r\n## Possible Problems\r\n\r\nI've spent some time trying to find places where the simple rule of \"copy the named return values to the naked return statement\" might break things.  I can't think of any. There are a few places where a naked return might be ambiguous, with regard to shadowed variables, but these are already prohibited by the compiler.  So I think we can assume that any valid Go code can apply this rule safely.","closed_by":{"login":"mvdan","id":3576549,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1NzY1NDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3576549?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mvdan","html_url":"https://github.com/mvdan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mvdan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mvdan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mvdan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mvdan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mvdan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mvdan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mvdan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mvdan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mvdan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mvdan/gofumpt/issues/285/reactions","total_count":23,"+1":20,"-1":1,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":2},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mvdan/gofumpt/issues/285/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
