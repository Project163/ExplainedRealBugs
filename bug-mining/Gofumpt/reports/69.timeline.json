files have had language version directives for a while, like `go 1.20`. In Go 1.21, they started allowing more specific versions such as `go 1.21.0` or `go 1.21rc3`.\r\n\r\nSome tools like https://github.com/mvdan/gofumpt want to fetch the language version from `go.mod`, to for example see if a module can use new syntax in Go 1.21 or not. This was easy enough when the format was `go 1.X`, where X is an integer. Now it's harder - a bit of code would have to be written to consider the trailing patch release number, pre-release suffixes like RCs or betas, etc.\r\n\r\nIn https://github.com/golang/go/issues/61692#issuecomment-1660299002, @findleyr and I seemed to agree that we should expose some API to deal with these version strings, since they are particular to Go and don't follow a standard like semver.\r\n\r\nFor example, how about a function to allow converting a Go version to semver:\r\n\r\n```\r\npackage modfile\r\n\r\nfunc SemverVersion(version string) string\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen, `SemverVersion(\"1.21rc3\") == \"v1.21-rc.3\"`, for example. It could also accept a `go` prefix, like `go1.21rc3`, since that is used in some places like git tag names - those don't appear in `go.mod` files, but I think it would be useful too.\r\n\r\nAlso see https://github.com/mvdan/gofumpt/issues/280 for the issue on gofumpt's side - it for now continues to panic if it sees any \"complex\" Go version it can't deal with.\r\n\r\ncc @dominikh since I think he also needs something like this API for staticcheck.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/golang/go/issues/62039/reactions","total_count":5,"+1":4,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":1,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/golang/go/issues/62039/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mvdan/gofumpt/issues/comments/1678709661","html_url":"https://github.com/mvdan/gofumpt/issues/280#issuecomment-1678709661","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mvdan/gofumpt/issues/280","id":1678709661,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCqWoQc5kDxOd","user":{"login":"mvdan","id":3576549,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1NzY1NDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3576549?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mvdan","html_url":"https://github.com/mvdan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mvdan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mvdan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mvdan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mvdan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mvdan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mvdan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mvdan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mvdan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mvdan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-08-15T10:11:44Z","updated_at":"2023-08-15T10:11:44Z","body":"Thanks for filing this - indeed it's on my mind, and we should have a tracking issue here.\r\n\r\nI've raised https://github.com/golang/go/issues/62039 to properly track the upstream feature request.","author_association":"OWNER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mvdan/gofumpt/issues/comments/1678709661/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"mvdan","id":3576549,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1NzY1NDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3576549?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mvdan","html_url":"https://github.com/mvdan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mvdan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mvdan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mvdan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mvdan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mvdan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mvdan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mvdan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mvdan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mvdan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mvdan/gofumpt/issues/comments/1678901649","html_url":"https://github.com/mvdan/gofumpt/issues/280#issuecomment-1678901649","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mvdan/gofumpt/issues/280","id":1678901649,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCqWoQc5kEgGR","user":{"login":"findleyr","id":57144380,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3MTQ0Mzgw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/57144380?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/findleyr","html_url":"https://github.com/findleyr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/findleyr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/findleyr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/findleyr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/findleyr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/findleyr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/findleyr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/findleyr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/findleyr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/findleyr/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-08-15T13:02:50Z","updated_at":"2023-08-15T13:02:50Z","body":"Thanks both.
