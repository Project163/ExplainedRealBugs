#285\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nAt present, this transformation ignores naked returns in functions with blank-named return values (i.e. `func() (_ int, err error)`) because rewriting them requires a literal zero value, which seemed unnecessary to evaluate the usefulness of this rule. It can be updated if we decide to move forward with this.\r\n\r\nThere's probably also room to improve the algorithm used to determine the nearest function parent to a given return statement. I didn't see any prior art within this project to copy, so I chose an easy option to implement, which I expect is enough to evaluate the usefulness. And we can optimize if deemed necessary.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mvdan/gofumpt/issues/287/reactions","total_count":4,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":2,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mvdan/gofumpt/issues/287/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":11620362768,"node_id":"CE_lADOCqWoQc50v0QPzwAAAAK0oKoQ","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mvdan/gofumpt/issues/events/11620362768","actor":{"login":"mvdan","id":3576549,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1NzY1NDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3576549?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mvdan","html_url":"https://github.com/mvdan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mvdan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mvdan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mvdan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mvdan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mvdan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mvdan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mvdan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mvdan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mvdan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":"37e046337216f326d5cd551ea0d12463919c13d0","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mvdan/gofumpt/commits/37e046337216f326d5cd551ea0d12463919c13d0","created_at":"2024-01-28T16:16:56Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mvdan/gofumpt/issues/comments/1913649014","html_url":"https://github.com/mvdan/gofumpt/issues/288#issuecomment-1913649014","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mvdan/gofumpt/issues/288","id":1913649014,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCqWoQc5yD_d2","user":{"login":"mvdan","id":3576549,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1NzY1NDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3576549?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mvdan","html_url":"https://github.com/mvdan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mvdan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mvdan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mvdan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mvdan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mvdan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mvdan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mvdan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mvdan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mvdan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-01-28T16:17:19Z","updated_at":"2024-01-28T16:17:19Z","body":"Thanks for spotting - I've never liked those line directives to be honest.
