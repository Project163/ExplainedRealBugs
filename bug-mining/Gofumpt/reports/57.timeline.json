It's also fair that we swapped the default behavior for `gofumpt -w .`, I think, because otherwise we'd be forcing every generator to follow gofumpt or have to run it afterwards.\r\n\r\nSo we need some way for you to be able to tell gofumpt \"I really do want you to format this file properly, I don't care that it's generated\".\r\n\r\nMy initial thought goes towards making `gofumpt -w generated.go` do that, whereas walking the directory via `gofumpt -w .` would disable the extra rules for that file as it does on the latest release. It's unfortunate to have this silent change of behavior, though we already do something similar for `vendor` folders; they are entirely skipped in `gofumpt -w .`, and only formatted if one explicitly does `gofumpt -w vendor`.\r\n\r\nIt still feels like too much magic, though. I think I'd be surprised as a user if running `gofumpt -w .` and then `gofumpt -w gen.go` produced changes. At least with `vendor`, the rule is easier to understand and less surprising.\r\n\r\nThe next thought that comes to mind is a flag, like `-g` or `-generated`, which would get you the old behavior for all the files being formatted. Adding more flags isn't ideal, but perhaps better than hidden magic :)

I got an interesting case which was introduced by https://github.com/mvdan/gofumpt/pull/195. \r\n\r\nI use pre-commit and more precisely [pre-commit-golang](https://github.com/TekWizely/pre-commit-golang) which provides gofumpt. gofump is executed with _a list of files_ that have changed and sometimes that list contains auto-generated files. It worked fine before but now with the new rule of formatting explicitly given files the flow is broken.\r\n\r\nOverall, I think we won't avoid having a flag that would enable/disable this behaviour globally. From my experience the most popular approaches are (1) don't touch auto-generated files ever, (2) allow formatting generated files with a flag.\r\n\r\nIMO (1) makes sense and it's a courtesy of various tools to provide (2) as well.

it.","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mvdan/gofumpt/issues/comments/1125884604/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"adambabik","id":277870,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3Nzg3MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/277870?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/adambabik","html_url":"https://github.com/adambabik","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adambabik/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adambabik/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adambabik/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adambabik/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adambabik/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adambabik/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adambabik/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adambabik/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adambabik/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":6604531870,"node_id":"MEE_lADOCqWoQc5AmXmtzwAAAAGJqSie","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mvdan/gofumpt/issues/events/6604531870","actor":{"login":"mvdan","id":3576549,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1NzY1NDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3576549?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mvdan","html_url":"https://github.com/mvdan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mvdan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mvdan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mvdan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mvdan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mvdan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mvdan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mvdan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mvdan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mvdan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-05-13T10:15:42Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":6604531878,"node_id":"SE_lADOCqWoQc5AmXmtzwAAAAGJqSim","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mvdan/gofumpt/issues/events/6604531878","actor":{"login":"mvdan","id":3576549,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1NzY1NDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3576549?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mvdan","html_url":"https://github.com/mvdan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mvdan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mvdan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mvdan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mvdan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mvdan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mvdan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mvdan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mvdan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mvdan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-05-13T10:15:42Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mvdan/gofumpt/issues/comments/1125891413","html_url":"https://github.com/mvdan/gofumpt/issues/180#issuecomment-1125891413","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mvdan/gofumpt/issues/180","id":1125891413,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCqWoQc5DG71V","user":{"login":"mvdan","id":3576549,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1NzY1NDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3576549?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mvdan","html_url":"https://github.com/mvdan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mvdan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mvdan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mvdan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mvdan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mvdan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mvdan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mvdan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mvdan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mvdan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-05-13T10:23:32Z","updated_at":"2022-05-13T10:23:32Z","body":"If

Now, if I'd like to run it only against changed files with `git status --porcelain | sed s/^...// | xargs gofumpt -l -d` it might give me a completely different result because it will inspect generated files.\r\n\r\nNot a blocker for me at this point but I wanted to share this use-case.","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mvdan/gofumpt/issues/comments/1125934774/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"adambabik","id":277870,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3Nzg3MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/277870?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/adambabik","html_url":"https://github.com/adambabik","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adambabik/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adambabik/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adambabik/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adambabik/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adambabik/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adambabik/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adambabik/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adambabik/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adambabik/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mvdan/gofumpt/issues/comments/1125978805","html_url":"https://github.com/mvdan/gofumpt/issues/180#issuecomment-1125978805","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mvdan/gofumpt/issues/180","id":1125978805,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCqWoQc5DHRK1","user":{"login":"mvdan","id":3576549,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1NzY1NDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3576549?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mvdan","html_url":"https://github.com/mvdan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mvdan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mvdan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mvdan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mvdan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mvdan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mvdan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mvdan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mvdan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mvdan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-05-13T11:55:50Z","updated_at":"2022-05-13T11:55:50Z","body":"I understand it's slightly awkward if you assume that running gofumpt on directories and files should behave the same, but that was always the case with vendor directories, and you can use a bit of shell logic to get the behavior you want.
