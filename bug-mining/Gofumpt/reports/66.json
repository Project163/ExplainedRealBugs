The current behavior:\r\n``` go\r\nvar (\r\n\tfoo = \"foo\"\r\n\t// bar = \"bar\"\r\n\t// baz = \"baz\"\r\n)\r\n```\r\n``` go\r\nvar foo = \"foo\" // bar = \"bar\"\r\n// baz = \"baz\"\r\n```\r\nIs it desired ? I would expect `gofumpt` to either keep the parentheses and comments untouched, or to format this way:\r\n``` go\r\nvar foo = \"foo\"\r\n// bar = \"bar\"\r\n// baz = \"baz\"\r\n```\r\nThis is also consistent with the behavior when  adding an inline comment:\r\n``` go\r\nvar (\r\n\tfoo = \"foo\" // foo\r\n\t// bar = \"bar\"\r\n\t// baz = \"baz\"\r\n)\r\n```\r\n``` go\r\nvar foo = \"foo\" // foo\r\n// bar = \"bar\"\r\n// baz = \"baz\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nI have no strong opinion on the matter, I just found it surprising.
