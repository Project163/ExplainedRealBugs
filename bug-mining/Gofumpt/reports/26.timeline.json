A linter that makes suggestions driven by magic comments and options would be a very different project from gofumpt. We want to stick to a design similar to `gofmt` wherever possible.\r\n\r\nHaving said all this, I do think we could make a distinction between:\r\n\r\n* Formatting rules that the vast majority of Go developers can live with, and which generally conform to \"idiomatic Go\"\r\n* Formatting rules which are more opinionated, and which might go too far for some developers\r\n\r\nThe former should be a default, while the latter could be opt-in via a flag similar to gofmt's `-s`, and it oculd include extra rules like this one. Such a flag could be enabled when trying to aggressively \"prettify\" generated or badly formatted Go code, or it could be run from time to time and selectively applied via `git add -p` or `git diff`.","author_association":"OWNER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mvdan/gofumpt/issues/comments/627998930/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"mvdan","id":3576549,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1NzY1NDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3576549?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mvdan","html_url":"https://github.com/mvdan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mvdan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mvdan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mvdan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mvdan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mvdan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mvdan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mvdan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mvdan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mvdan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mvdan/gofumpt/issues/comments/628426702","html_url":"https://github.com/mvdan/gofumpt/issues/53#issuecomment-628426702","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mvdan/gofumpt/issues/53","id":628426702,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYyODQyNjcwMg==","user":{"login":"SchumacherFM","id":372027,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3MjAyNw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/372027?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SchumacherFM","html_url":"https://github.com/SchumacherFM","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SchumacherFM/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SchumacherFM/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SchumacherFM/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SchumacherFM/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SchumacherFM/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SchumacherFM/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SchumacherFM/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SchumacherFM/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SchumacherFM/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-05-14T06:50:11Z","updated_at":"2020-05-14T06:50:51Z","body":"FYI: I've tried out the new feature from @twpayne and the new formatting breaks our code base.\r\n\r\nWe have function signatures like \r\n```\r\nfunc (s *Service) GetX(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request, token string, addrkey string) (model.Summary, error)\r\n```\r\nfrom these services a code generator creates Go RPC and Typescript code.
