some cases, it's desirable to not format certain files like test fixtures. Ignoring such files can be achieved by passing a explicit list of files to gofump, but then big projects risk into running into the maximum command line length which on Windows is only 8191 characters.\r\n\r\nI suggest to support a `-exclude` argument where users could pass individual files to exclude to the CLI. It should support both file and directory arguments. Another benefit of such a argument is to speed up the invocation by ignoring big directories like `node_modules` which often contain upwards of 100k files.\r\n\r\n```bash\r\ngo run
