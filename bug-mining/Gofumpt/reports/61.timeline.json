basically, we'd like consistent formatting of `case` values, regardless of the body of the branch.\r\n\r\nIn our projects, we have the following convention: if there is only one `case` value, leave it on the same line as `case`; otherwise, put every value on its own line.  Again, regardless of the branch body.  This is done in order to make the values more visible, make diffs cleaner (making value additions and removals more obvious), make it easier to (re)sort the values (i.e. using Vi(m)'s `:sort`), and also to make it easier to add comments to values later, if necessary.

one.","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mvdan/gofumpt/issues/comments/1087445688/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"ainar-g","id":4964986,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5NjQ5ODY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4964986?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ainar-g","html_url":"https://github.com/ainar-g","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ainar-g/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ainar-g/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ainar-g/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ainar-g/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ainar-g/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ainar-g/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ainar-g/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ainar-g/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ainar-g/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":6362230364,"node_id":"MEE_lADOCqWoQc5Gz0DvzwAAAAF7N-5c","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mvdan/gofumpt/issues/events/6362230364","actor":{"login":"mvdan","id":3576549,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1NzY1NDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3576549?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mvdan","html_url":"https://github.com/mvdan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mvdan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mvdan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mvdan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mvdan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mvdan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mvdan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mvdan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mvdan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mvdan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-04-04T11:35:05Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":6362230371,"node_id":"SE_lADOCqWoQc5Gz0DvzwAAAAF7N-5j","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mvdan/gofumpt/issues/events/6362230371","actor":{"login":"mvdan","id":3576549,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1NzY1NDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3576549?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mvdan","html_url":"https://github.com/mvdan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mvdan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mvdan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mvdan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mvdan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mvdan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mvdan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mvdan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mvdan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mvdan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-04-04T11:35:05Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mvdan/gofumpt/issues/comments/1102226571","html_url":"https://github.com/mvdan/gofumpt/issues/217#issuecomment-1102226571","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mvdan/gofumpt/issues/217","id":1102226571,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCqWoQc5BsqSL","user":{"login":"mvdan","id":3576549,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1NzY1NDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3576549?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mvdan","html_url":"https://github.com/mvdan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mvdan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mvdan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mvdan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mvdan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mvdan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mvdan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mvdan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mvdan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mvdan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-04-19T07:48:44Z","updated_at":"2022-04-19T07:48:44Z","body":"> we'd like consistent formatting of `case` values, regardless of the body of the branch.\r\n\r\nRight, and Takbir's patch fixes that. The fact that the body was part of the formatting algorithm was a bug.\r\n\r\n> if there is only one `case` value, leave it on the same line as `case`; otherwise, put every value on its own line\r\n\r\nFYI, that is not what gofumpt enforces right now (with Takbir's fix). All we do is that, if a `case` clause's expression list is short enough to fit comfortably within a single line, we remove the newlines to make it so.\r\n\r\nI can see your argument about shorter diffs and easier line-based editing, and perhaps we could tweak the formatting to not kick in when there is a newline _before the first element_, presumably meaning that the user wants this line-based formatting. However, I'll also admit I don't think this formatting really works in practice due to the trailing tokens; all elements end with a comma, except the last one, which ends in a colon.","author_association":"OWNER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mvdan/gofumpt/issues/comments/1102226571/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"mvdan","id":3576549,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1NzY1NDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3576549?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mvdan","html_url":"https://github.com/mvdan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mvdan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mvdan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mvdan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mvdan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mvdan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mvdan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mvdan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mvdan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mvdan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":6452834567,"node_id":"CE_lADOCqWoQc5Gz0DvzwAAAAGAnnEH","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mvdan/gofumpt/issues/events/6452834567","actor":{"login":"mvdan","id":3576549,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1NzY1NDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3576549?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mvdan","html_url":"https://github.com/mvdan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mvdan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mvdan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mvdan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mvdan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mvdan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mvdan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mvdan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mvdan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mvdan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-04-19T07:49:42Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":6452834675,"node_id":"REFE_lADOCqWoQc5Gz0DvzwAAAAGAnnFz","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mvdan/gofumpt/issues/events/6452834675","actor":{"login":"mvdan","id":3576549,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1NzY1NDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3576549?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mvdan","html_url":"https://github.com/mvdan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mvdan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mvdan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mvdan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mvdan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mvdan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mvdan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mvdan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mvdan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mvdan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"b5619f8b06cad833eac1c454a48024599d8f5192","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mvdan/gofumpt/commits/b5619f8b06cad833eac1c454a48024599d8f5192","created_at":"2022-04-19T07:49:43Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mvdan/gofumpt/issues/comments/1102228730","html_url":"https://github.com/mvdan/gofumpt/issues/217#issuecomment-1102228730","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mvdan/gofumpt/issues/217","id":1102228730,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCqWoQc5Bsqz6","user":{"login":"mvdan","id":3576549,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1NzY1NDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3576549?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mvdan","html_url":"https://github.com/mvdan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mvdan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mvdan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mvdan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mvdan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mvdan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mvdan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mvdan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mvdan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mvdan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-04-19T07:50:19Z","updated_at":"2022-04-19T07:50:19Z","body":"This
