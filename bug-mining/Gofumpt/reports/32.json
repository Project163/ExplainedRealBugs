Thus, if one wanted to use gofumpt while also getting the benefits of goimports, gofumports was useful.\r\n\r\nHowever, a lot has changed in the past year; gopls has come a long way, and most major editors have good gopls integrations by now. They will also add gofumpt soon: https://github.com/golang/go/issues/39805\r\n\r\nSo I see less reason to support a fork of goimports on top of a fork of gofmt. If someone really wants to get the best of both worlds from the command line, they can just run both tools one after the other, like: `goimports -l -w . && gofumpt -l -w .`\r\n\r\nThere are several advantages to dropping the goimports fork:\r\n\r\n* goimports is big and complex, making this module very large (I have to copy a dozen internal packages)\r\n* Given the point above, it's also extra work to maintain the project, especially in the long run\r\n* goimports is not a superset of gofmt; for example, the `-s` flag does not exist there, and we want to start enforcing it\r\n* Encouraging the use of a single formatter for all needs is a losing game - as long as gofumpt and goimports don't contradict each other, we are OK\r\n\r\nWill leave this issue open for a couple of weeks to see what others think. I'll wait for the gopls issue to be fixed and released, in any case.","closed_by":{"login":"mvdan","id":3576549,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1NzY1NDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3576549?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mvdan","html_url":"https://github.com/mvdan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mvdan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mvdan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mvdan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mvdan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mvdan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mvdan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mvdan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mvdan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mvdan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mvdan/gofumpt/issues/75/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":0,"-1":1,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mvdan/gofumpt/issues/75/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
