For example:\r\n\r\n* The rewrite flag, `-r`, isn't used by many people. Those who depend on it should just use `gofmt -r`.\r\n* The simplify flag, `-s`, is on by default in gofumpt. It makes little sense to allow disabling it. The only use case I can think of is the Go compiler itself, since it needs to bootstrap from a very old version of Go, which might break if `-s` removes some types which later Go versions made optional. But we could always fix that with the `-lang` flag.\r\n* The `-cpuprofile` flag is an internal performance tool, so it shouldn't really be exposed. The `-e` flag probably fits the same bill, but perhaps some users actually make use of it.","closed_by":{"login":"mvdan","id":3576549,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1NzY1NDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3576549?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mvdan","html_url":"https://github.com/mvdan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mvdan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mvdan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mvdan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mvdan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mvdan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mvdan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mvdan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mvdan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mvdan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mvdan/gofumpt/issues/105/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mvdan/gofumpt/issues/105/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
