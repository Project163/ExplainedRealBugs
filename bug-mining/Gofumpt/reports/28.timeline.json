and happy Thanksgiving. 🦃 \r\n\r\n`gofumpt` recently implemented the feature of leaving along the following code:\r\n\r\n```\r\nif longCondition1 &&\r\n\tlongCondition2 &&\r\n\tlongCondition3 &&\r\n\tlongCondition4 &&\r\n\tlongCondition5 {\r\n\r\n\treturn 123\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, it seems that `gofumpt` will still mess up code with comments.\r\nFor example, the following code:\r\n\r\n```\r\nif longCondition1 &&\r\n\tlongCondition2 &&\r\n\tlongCondition3 &&\r\n\tlongCondition4 &&\r\n\tlongCondition5 {\r\n\r\n\t// We specifically want to return 123 here because of quantum fluctuations\r\n\treturn 123\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWill be transformed into:\r\n\r\n```\r\nif longCondition1 &&\r\n\tlongCondition2 &&\r\n\tlongCondition3 &&\r\n\tlongCondition4 &&\r\n\tlongCondition5 {\r\n\t// We specifically want to return 123 here because of quantum fluctuations\r\n\treturn 123\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is undesired for the same reason as [the original issue](https://github.com/mvdan/gofumpt/issues/88).\r\nIs this a
