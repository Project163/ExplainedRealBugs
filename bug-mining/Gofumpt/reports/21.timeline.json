Like I mentioned before, the correct way to do the right thing would be to look at `go.mod`, but that would first require refactoring the tool a bit to be module-aware.\r\n\r\nHowever, I'm OK with adding a \"go version\" argument to the internal API. That way, once the external tool starts grabbing the version from `go.mod`, it can pass the version along. The same could apply to other tools like gopls, if they integrate the gofumpt internals in the future.\r\n\r\nFor now, we can just make our gofumpt tool always pass go 1.15. The format should be a string, matching what `go list -m -json` shows for a module:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ go list -m -json\r\n{\r\n\t\"Path\": \"mvdan.cc/sh/v3\",\r\n\t\"Main\": true,\r\n\t\"Dir\": \"/home/mvdan/src/sh\",\r\n\t\"GoMod\": \"/home/mvdan/src/sh/go.mod\",\r\n\t\"GoVersion\": \"1.14\"\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nSemver comparisons would be a bit awkward, but you can reuse
