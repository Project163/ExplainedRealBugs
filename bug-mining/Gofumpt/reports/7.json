The same would happen for `var n1, n2 = v1, v2`, which would become `n1, n2 := v1, v2`.\r\n\r\nExceptions:\r\n\r\n* Globals, because `name := value` is only valid as a statement\r\n* `var name Type = value` and `var name Type`\r\n\r\nThe only edge case I see is `var name = zerovalue`, like `var s = \"\"`. Rewriting that to `s := \"\"` is fine, but some people might prefer `var s string`. Then again, if people prefer that form, they can use it directly and the tool won't change it.","closed_by":{"login":"mvdan","id":3576549,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1NzY1NDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3576549?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mvdan","html_url":"https://github.com/mvdan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mvdan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mvdan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mvdan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mvdan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mvdan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mvdan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mvdan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mvdan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mvdan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mvdan/gofumpt/issues/14/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mvdan/gofumpt/issues/14/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
