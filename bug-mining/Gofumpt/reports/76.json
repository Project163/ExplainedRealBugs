Ignoring such files can be achieved by passing a explicit list of files to gofump, but then big projects risk into running into the maximum command line length which on Windows is only 8191 characters.\r\n\r\nI suggest to support a `-exclude` argument where users could pass individual files to exclude to the CLI. It should support both file and directory arguments. Another benefit of such a argument is to speed up the invocation by ignoring big directories like `node_modules` which often contain upwards of 100k files.\r\n\r\n```bash\r\ngo run mvdan.cc/gofumpt@v0.4.0 -exclude test/fixture.go,fixtures,node_modules .\r\n```","closed_by":{"login":"mvdan","id":3576549,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1NzY1NDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3576549?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mvdan","html_url":"https://github.com/mvdan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mvdan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mvdan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mvdan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mvdan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mvdan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mvdan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mvdan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mvdan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mvdan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mvdan/gofumpt/issues/250/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mvdan/gofumpt/issues/250/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
