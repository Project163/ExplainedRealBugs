However, it does not seem to account for multi-line conditionals. Consider the following:\r\n\r\n```\r\n// This return statement is intentionally spaced apart from the conditionals in order to strongly delineate\r\n// the \"if statement\" and the \"executing code block\", so to speak\r\nif longCondition1 &&\r\n\tlongCondition2 &&\r\n\tlongCondition3 &&\r\n\tlongCondition4 &&\r\n\tlongCondition5 {\r\n\r\n\treturn 123\r\n}\r\n```\r\n```\r\n// gofumpt has now made the return statement smooshed together with the conditionals,\r\n// making it hard to see, at a glance, which lines are if statement conditions, and which lines are executing code\r\nif longCondition1 &&\r\n\tlongCondition2 &&\r\n\tlongCondition3 &&\r\n\tlongCondition4 &&\r\n\tlongCondition5 {\r\n\treturn 123\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nI propose that gofumpt \"leaves alone\" this 2nd code snippet.\r\nThis would change the wording of the rule to something along the lines of:\r\n\"No empty lines around a lone statement (or comment) in a block (unless it is a multi-line conditional)\".","closed_by":{"login":"mvdan","id":3576549,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1NzY1NDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3576549?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mvdan","html_url":"https://github.com/mvdan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mvdan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mvdan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mvdan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mvdan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mvdan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mvdan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mvdan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mvdan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mvdan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mvdan/gofumpt/issues/88/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mvdan/gofumpt/issues/88/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
