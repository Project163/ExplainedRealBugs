This rule could be made stronger in the future, such as enforcing parameters to all be on separate lines\r\n\r\nI'm actually interested in writing such a lint-check for our own organization.  It would have the semantics that if a function's \"first line\" (receiver + name + parameter list + return) does not fit on one line, it requires it to be broken it up so that each parameter is on own line, and possibly each return value (and possibly the receiver) as well.  It would require, as input, a line-length limit.\r\n\r\nWould there be interest in incorporating this into gfumpt (presumably opt-in) if I wrote it?  If so I might do it that way, rather than as a separate linter.\r\n\r\n(I would write this error to be auto-fixable, if that's possible in gofumpt -- I don't know enough about the tool yet to say.
