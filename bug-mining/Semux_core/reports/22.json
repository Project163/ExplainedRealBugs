Should 'idle' gas rate hover around 238?  less?\r\n\r\nCurrently sem is around 67c-75c each.  at 0.005 sem, 238nSem/gas is $0.003, less than eth by half, but we are young, and our blocks are empty.\r\n\r\nIf blocks continue to be empty, should we put a lower limit on gas price? \r\nShould we allow validators to decide on their own what the lowest gas they'll accept is?\r\nHow should dPOS work with gas prices?  On one point, if i have a huge server, i should be free to suck up any mempool things that weak validators can't process.  And if I have a weak validator, i should only take the top X transactions to maximize what I can process and propose in the little amount of time I have to propose a block.\r\n\r\nAll ideas are open at this point.  Let's figure out what makes sense.","closed_by":{"login":"orogvany","id":24282143,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0MjgyMTQz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24282143?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/orogvany","html_url":"https://github.com/orogvany","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/orogvany/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/orogvany/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/orogvany/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/orogvany/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/orogvany/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/orogvany/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/orogvany/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/orogvany/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/orogvany/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/semuxproject/semux-core/issues/100/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/semuxproject/semux-core/issues/100/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
