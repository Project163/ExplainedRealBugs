are two paths that could lead to `enterFinalize`:\r\n- When 2/3 of the validators have signalled `COMMIT` vote (see the 2/3 vote check [here](https://github.com/semuxproject/semux-core/blob/ab431cb723deba0552dcf04b1b55670a1960f7a0/src/main/java/org/semux/consensus/SemuxBft.java#L552-L555))\r\n- Time out after the commit phase (see [this code](https://github.com/semuxproject/semux-core/blob/ab431cb723deba0552dcf04b1b55670a1960f7a0/src/main/java/org/semux/consensus/SemuxBft.java#L587-L589))\r\n\r\nCompared with the original PBFT algorithm, SemuxBFT works as follows:\r\n```\r\nPRE_PREPARE message     -> BFT_PROPOSAL message\r\n\r\nPREPARE message         -> BFT_VOTE message (VALIDATE vote)\r\n\r\n<prepared certificate>  -> 2/3 VALIATE certificate\r\n\r\nCOMMIT message          -> BFT_VOTE message (PRECOMMIT vote)\r\n\r\n<commited certificate>  -> 2/3 PRECOMMIT certificate\r\n\r\nCommit state change     -> Broadcast BFT_VOTE message (COMMIT vote)\r\n                           Wait for 2/3 COMMIT votes or timeout (whichever comes first)\r\n                           Commit state change\r\n```\r\n\r\nAs you see, the `COMMIT` votes are mainly for network synchronization purpose. It is not part of the certificates and is not related to `COMMIT` messages in

There are two paths that could lead to `enterFinalize`:\r\n> \r\n> * When 2/3 of the validators have signalled `COMMIT` vote (see the 2/3 vote check [here](https://github.com/semuxproject/semux-core/blob/ab431cb723deba0552dcf04b1b55670a1960f7a0/src/main/java/org/semux/consensus/SemuxBft.java#L552-L555))\r\n> * Time out after the commit phase (see [this code](https://github.com/semuxproject/semux-core/blob/ab431cb723deba0552dcf04b1b55670a1960f7a0/src/main/java/org/semux/consensus/SemuxBft.java#L587-L589))\r\n> \r\n> Compared with the original PBFT algorithm, SemuxBFT works as follows:\r\n> \r\n> ```\r\n> PRE_PREPARE message     -> BFT_PROPOSAL message\r\n> \r\n> PREPARE message         -> BFT_VOTE message (VALIDATE vote)\r\n> \r\n> <prepared certificate>  -> 2/3 VALIATE certificate\r\n> \r\n> COMMIT message          -> BFT_VOTE message (PRECOMMIT vote)\r\n> \r\n> <commited certificate>  -> 2/3 PRECOMMIT certificate\r\n> \r\n> Commit state change     -> Broadcast BFT_VOTE message (COMMIT vote)\r\n>                            Wait for 2/3 COMMIT votes or timeout (whichever comes first)\r\n>                            Commit state change\r\n> ```\r\n> \r\n> As you see, the `COMMIT` votes are mainly for network synchronization purpose.
