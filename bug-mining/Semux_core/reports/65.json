the change to use wei, values often exceed Long.max\r\n\r\nWhen we persist the TransactionResult, this often overflows, and stores the wrong value.\r\n\r\nThankfully, I used devnet, so i dont think i broke testnet2 already, but fixing this will break testnet without fork.\r\n\r\nIt's also slightly odd that values are interpreted as wei in contracts, so if i want to send 100 sem within a contract, I need to do\r\n```\r\n  byte[] method = HashUtil.keccak256(\"transfer(address,uint256)\".getBytes(StandardCharsets.UTF_8));\r\n        byte[] methodData = ByteArrayUtil.merge(Arrays.copyOf(method, 4),\r\n                DataWord.of(to).getData(), DataWord.of( new BigInteger(\"100000000000000000000\")).getData());\r\n```\r\ninstead of 100000000000 as I would expect.\r\n\r\nIf I retrieve internal transaction for the above, I get (converted wei to sem)\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  \"success\" : true,\r\n  \"message\" : \"successful operation\",\r\n  \"result\" : {\r\n    \"blockNumber\" : null,\r\n    \"logs\" : [ ],\r\n    \"returnData\" : \"0x\",\r\n    \"gasUsed\" : \"30986\",\r\n    \"code\" : \"SUCCESS\",\r\n    \"internalTransactions\" : [ {\r\n      \"type\" : \"CALL\",\r\n      \"from\" : \"0x5c92355fddd7639ecf6f5bfdaee33e62e808aa3c\",\r\n      \"to\" : \"0x64d04522b749b44b1bf0e1afffdd99ef2b826861\",\r\n      \"amount\" : \"7766279631\"\r\n    } ]\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\nSo it breaks on very low sem amounts (<100sem)\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"orogvany","id":24282143,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0MjgyMTQz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24282143?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/orogvany","html_url":"https://github.com/orogvany","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/orogvany/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/orogvany/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/orogvany/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/orogvany/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/orogvany/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/orogvany/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/orogvany/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/orogvany/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/orogvany/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/semuxproject/semux-core/issues/187/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/semuxproject/semux-core/issues/187/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
