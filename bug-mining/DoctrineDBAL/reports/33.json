the DBAL public API uses `PDO` constants which creates a hard dependency and makes the abstraction not that abstract. For the end user, it means that even if none of the `PDO` drivers are going to be used, the production environment still has to have `ext-pdo` installed.\r\n\r\nTo eliminate the dependency, the `PDO` constants in the method signatures should be replaced by the DBAL's own ones:\r\n\r\n1. `PDO::PARAM_*` → `Doctrine\\DBAL\\Driver\\Statement::PARAM_*`,\r\n2. `PDO::FETCH_*` → `Doctrine\\DBAL\\Driver\\ResultStatement::FETCH_*`,\r\n3. `PDO::CASE_*` → `Doctrine\\DBAL\\Driver\\ResultStatement::CASE_*`.\r\n\r\nIt can be done in phases:\r\n\r\n1. In `2.x`, introduce the new DBAL constants and assign them corresponding PDO values, e.g. `Statement::PARAM_INT = PDO::PARAM_INT`.\r\n2. Deprecate the usage of `PDO::` constants when calling the DBAL methods.\r\n3. In `3.0`, replace the `PDO` constants with their integer values, e.g. `Statement::PARAM_INT = 1`\r\n4. Remove the dependency.","closed_by":{"login":"Ocramius","id":154256,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1NDI1Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/154256?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ocramius","html_url":"https://github.com/Ocramius","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ocramius/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ocramius/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ocramius/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ocramius/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ocramius/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ocramius/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ocramius/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ocramius/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ocramius/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doctrine/dbal/issues/2953/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doctrine/dbal/issues/2953/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
