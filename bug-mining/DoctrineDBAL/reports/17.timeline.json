Actually, the default for Oracle is using these type of connect descriptors (or easy connect, they use both terms) in `tnsnames.ora` or related files (see the [Oracle Naming doc](https://docs.oracle.com/cd/B19306_01/network.102/b14212/naming.htm) & [Oracle ID/Access database doc](https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E11882_01/network.112/e41945/concepts.htm)).\n\nSo, at the moment the default method for providing the connection info for Oracle DBs is not supported, although it is being used internally. PDO is the PHP solution for connecting to databases, which means that it is not the default for sharing the connections details. That way, there is a significant difference between the two.\n\nI will make a PR soon (it doesn't need that much change
