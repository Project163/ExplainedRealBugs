successful insert example, to show that all columns get overwritten:\nhttps://github.com/pdgcvs/DoctrineInsertPHP7\n\nWhen trying to use persist method with OCI8 driver on PHP 7 all the column values got overwritten by one.\nThis also leads to many format validation errors preventing the data from being inserted into table.\n\nThe problem seems to be on OCI8Statement->bindValue function when the local variable $value is passed as reference to bindParam.\n\nI tried to make a simple fix by storing values of bind call in an array (instance member) before passing it as reference to bindParam.\n\nSo far it seems to be working.\n\nhttps://github.com/pdgcvs/dbal/commit/4906c6518e09d56063c6c1e9594987467071bc35
