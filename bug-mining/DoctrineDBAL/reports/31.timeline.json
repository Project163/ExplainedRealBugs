support for MariaDB 10.2.7+.\r\n\r\n> Doctrine currently does not support MariaDB 10.2.7+. Schema creation/update is triggering infinite schema diffs\r\n\r\n**Updated**: Title updated from 'MariaDB 10.2 support (will also fix version detection), version detection should be considered as new feature.\r\n  \r\n## Features \r\n\r\n- [x] 1. MariaDb version detection (strip '5.5.5-' prefix)\r\n\r\n> To circumvent a limitation in the replication protocol, MariaDB 10+\r\n> use a prefixed version with '5.5.5-' (for instance `5.5.5-Mariadb-10.0.8-xenial`).\r\n> This cause issues with the current detection mechanism with both Mysqli and PDOMysql\r\n> dbal implementations (always detect 5.5.5). While mariadb strips the prefix \r\n> automatically in their `libmariadb-client`, most (if not all) of php installations\r\n> relies on `mysqlnd`, so the removal of the prefix `5.5.5-` must be made\r\n> in userland (MysqliConnection.php and AbstractMySQLDriver.php).\r\n> See https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-4088 for reference.    \r\n\r\n- [x] ~2. MariaDb 10.2 support `BLOB/TEXT` defaults values (since 10.2.1).~\r\n\r\n**Update:** Removed from this P/R... will be made available in a subsequent P/R (due to architecture decision to be made - current doctrine implementation needs to be reworked)\r\n      \r\n> Note that Mysql (as of 5.7.19) is not yet supporting defaults for BLOB and TEXT.    \r\n> See https://mariadb.com/kb/en/library/blob-and-text-data-types\r\n  \r\n- [x] **UPDATED** ~3. MariaDb 10.2 support `JSON` type.~       \r\n\r\nRemoved from P/R by @lcobucci, probably to reflect the fact that MariaDB alias JSON to MEDIUMTEXT\r\n      \r\n> ~The JSON type have been introduced in 10.2.7 as an alias to LONGTEXT.\r\n> See https://mariadb.com/kb/en/library/json-data-type/\r\n> To ensure portability between MySQL/Mariadb, the best is to prefer TEXT type over JSON when defining schema (till a *real* JSON type appears in Maria).~  \r\n\r\n- [x] 4. MariaDb 10.2 supports `CURRENT_TIME`, `CURRENT_DATE` as default values\r\n\r\n> Note that MySQL (as of 5.7.19) does *not* support default values CURRENT_TIME and\r\n> CURRENT_DATE as default values for TIME and DATE columns (CURRENT_TIMESTAMP\r\n> for DATETIME is supported). \r\n \r\n- [x] ~5. Default literal values must be escaped.~\r\n\r\n**Update:** Removed from this PR in favor of #2850...  Current doctrine implementation does not handle escaping of defaults (backslashes...), adding it in this P/R should be done for all platforms at once and thus introduce more BC-risks (bugs...). Implementing separately looks safer and should help having this P/R sooner. Both P/R can be done independently.\r\n\r\n> ~While table comments are automatically quoted (`MySQLPlatform::quoteStringLiteral()`) the\r\n> default column values were not. Defaults values for string literals are now properly quoted.~\r\n\r\n- [x] 6. MariaDB 10.2.7 information changes schema for default values.\r\n\r\n> In order to allow [expressions](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-10134) as default values and distinguish them \r\n> from literals, Mariadb now quotes default values in `information_schema.column` table. \r\n> This changes brings a lot of incompatibilities between the (Oracle-)Mysql/MariaDB platforms.\r\n>\r\n> Instead of creating a specific SchemaManager for MariaDB, the solution taken in this P/R is to map\r\n> the introduced changes in the current `MySQLSchemaManager` (method: getMariaDb1027ColumnDefault()). \r\n> \r\n> From MariaDB 10.2.7, information schema changes includes:\r\n> - NULL is now quoted as 'NULL' (see exceptions in  https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-14053. Unquoted null is technically possible)\r\n> - String defaults are quoted (To save the string 'NULL', set the default as ''NULL'').\r\n> - CURRENT_TIMESTAMP, CURRENT_DATE, CURRENT_TIME defaults are silently changed to 'current_timestamp()', 'currdate()', 'currtime()'.\r\n>   To prevent schema diff, they are mapped back to their original values.     \r\n> - (**UPDATED**) Partial support for default literal escaping have been done. Currently\r\n>   limited on schema introspection. #2850 will bring the support for backslashes in defaults later on\r\n>   but the code is ready.\r\n>\r\n> See https://mariadb.com/kb/en/library/information-schema-columns-table/ for reference and\r\n> https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-13132, https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-13341 for history.\r\n>\r\n> Will fix: \r\n>\r\n> - https://github.com/doctrine/dbal/issues/2817 (invalid detection of column default values)\r\n> - https://github.com/doctrine/doctrine2/issues/6565 (schema update will alter all tables with columns_default='null')\r\n\r\n- [x] 7. Support for MariaDB 10.2 reserved keywords.\r\n\r\n- [x] 8. Added MariaDB 10.2 in travis (both pdo_mysql and mysqli)\r\n\t\t\t\r\n## Possible BC-breaks:\r\n\r\nNone found.
