     Q       |   A\r\n|------------- | -----------\r\n| Type         | bug\r\n| BC Break     | no\r\n| Fixed issues | #4637\r\n\r\nFixes #4637\r\n\r\nAs per #4637, `vimeo/psalm:4.6.4` cannot introduce templated parameters within a re-used imported\r\ntype: this is understandable, since imported types are copy-paste aided by the type checker, but do\r\nnot carry any template information with them (and it would be too complex to do so anyway).\r\n\r\nQuoting the initial issue:\r\n\r\nMinimal reproducer: https://psalm.dev/r/62a0a5854d\r\n\r\n```php\r\n<?php\r\n\r\nclass Connection {}\r\nclass MyConnection extends Connection{}\r\n\r\n/**\r\n * @psalm-type Params = array{\r\n *     charset?: string,\r\n *     wrapperClass?: class-string<Connection>,\r\n * }\r\n */\r\nfinal class DriverManager\r\n{\r\n    /**\r\n     * @param array<string,mixed> $params\r\n     * @param Configuration|null  $config       The configuration to use.\r\n     * @param EventManager|null   $eventManager The event manager to use.\r\n     *\r\n     * @phpstan-param array<string,mixed> $params\r\n     * @psalm-param Params $params\r\n     * @psalm-return ($params is array{wrapperClass:mixed} ? T : Connection)\r\n     * @template T of Connection\r\n     */\r\n    public static function getConnection(\r\n        array $params\r\n    ): Connection {\r\n        throw new \\Exception('irrelevant');\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\nfunction mkConnection(): MyConnection {\r\n    return DriverManager::getConnection(['wrapperClass' => MyConnection::class]);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhich produces:\r\n\r\n```\r\nPsalm output (using commit aa854ae):\r\n\r\nINFO: MixedInferredReturnType - 31:26 - Could not verify return type 'MyConnection' for mkConnection\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe issue is that the `Param` alias type is not templated: this is potentially a psalm limitation, but also an understandable one, since there is no syntax to specify template arguments for an imported type (AFAIK).\r\n\r\nHere is a potential fix:\r\n\r\nhttps://psalm.dev/r/8ef9909bb9\r\n\r\n```php\r\n<?php\r\n\r\nclass Connection {}\r\nclass MyConnection extends Connection{}\r\n\r\n/**\r\n * @psalm-type Params = array{\r\n *     charset?: string,\r\n *     wrapperClass?: class-string<Connection>,\r\n * }\r\n */\r\nfinal class DriverManager\r\n{\r\n    /**\r\n     * @psalm-param array{\r\n     *     charset?: string,\r\n     *     wrapperClass?: class-string<T>,\r\n     * } $params\r\n     * @psalm-return ($params is array{wrapperClass: mixed} ? T : Connection)\r\n     * @template T of Connection\r\n     */\r\n    public static function getConnection(\r\n        array $params\r\n    ): Connection {\r\n        throw new \\Exception('irrelevant');\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\nfunction mkConnection(): MyConnection {\r\n    return DriverManager::getConnection(['wrapperClass' => MyConnection::class]);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt's a bit ugly, but the idea is that we replace `Params` with the concrete definition again, but this time including `T`, so that the type inference can correctly fill the type variable with the given input:\r\n\r\n```\r\nPsalm output (using commit aa854ae):\r\n\r\nNo issues!\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe idea therefore is to re-introduce some duplication at the advantage of better type inference later on.\r\n\r\nIn order to verify that the change had an effect, we introduced a new `tests/Doctrine/StaticAnalysis` directory,\r\nto be checked via `vendor/bin/psalm -c psalm-strict.xml`, which will tell us exactly whether there are obvious\r\ntype-checker issues around our code. Since `psalm.xml.dist` uses `errorLevel=\"2\"`, it is not sufficient to integrate\r\nthis directory within the normal workflow.\r\n\r\nBecause this project uses a custom github action for running `vimeo/psalm`, it is not really possible to run this\r\nin CI, and therefore that part of the patch has been omitted.\r\n\r\nIt is endorsed that maintainers of `doctrine/dbal` in future:\r\n\r\n 1. commit `composer.lock`\r\n 2. set up dependabot to track dependency upgrades\r\n 3. use the standard `vimeo/psalm` via `require-dev`, and run the CI static analysis checks from the same\r\n    environment that runs normal unit/integration
