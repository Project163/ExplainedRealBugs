coming up empty on the following observation. I'm not sure if it's an issue or not, and perhaps someone here could advise.\n\nI went ahead and installed doctrine/dbal 2.5.2 (via composer) into a project running atop of PHP 5.6.16, and I'm using pgsql as my backend database. I was previously running 2.5.1 on a PHP 5.3.\\* without issue. \n\nIn connecting via dbal to the database, I am seeing this now:\n`Fatal error: Undefined class constant 'PGSQL_ATTR_DISABLE_PREPARES' in /path-to-files/vendor/doctrine/dbal/lib/Doctrine/DBAL/Driver/PDOPgSql/Driver.php on line 49`\n\nThat block is shown:\n\n``` php\nif (PHP_VERSION_ID >= 50600\n                && (! isset($driverOptions[PDO::PGSQL_ATTR_DISABLE_PREPARES])\n                    || true === $driverOptions[PDO::PGSQL_ATTR_DISABLE_PREPARES]\n                )\n            ) {\n                $pdo->setAttribute(PDO::PGSQL_ATTR_DISABLE_PREPARES, true);\n            }\n```\n\nIf I comment out this entire block, the fatal error goes away and things _seem_ to work normally. I'm not comfortable just commenting this out, since I don't know the full ramifications of such an action.\n\nAny advice is much appreciated and I hope I'm not breaking any conventions by reporting this here. Thanks!\n\nJP\n","closed_by":{"login":"Ocramius","id":154256,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1NDI1Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/154256?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ocramius","html_url":"https://github.com/Ocramius","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ocramius/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ocramius/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ocramius/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ocramius/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ocramius/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ocramius/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ocramius/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ocramius/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ocramius/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doctrine/dbal/issues/2249/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doctrine/dbal/issues/2249/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
