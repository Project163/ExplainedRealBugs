expectations with DBAL, including QueryBuilder, is that it handles Database differences.\r\n\r\n`<op> Why otherwise would we bother abstracting queries with QueryBuilder? For anyone accustomed to SQL it does not exactly make it easier to read.  </op>` 🤷‍♂️ \r\n\r\nAnyways..\r\n- While Query Builder states this in class doc, this is not where most users starts out\r\n- Solution for this seems to be _kind of_ planned for 3.0, however for 2.x doc can be improved\r\n\r\nSo suggestion here is to make this more clear on doc and PHP doc that covers features where users needs to be aware it depends on database if it is supported or not.\r\n\r\n#### Current behaviour\r\n\r\nFeatures on QueryBuilder is not supported across databases.\r\n\r\n#### How to reproduce\r\n\r\nUse features not supported on some databases, for example alias argument on ->update().\r\n\r\n#### Expected behaviour\r\n\r\nEither:\r\nA. DBAL handles this for us\r\nB. Doc is clear on every single feature where this can be a problem _(ok'ish while waiting for A)_\r\nC. Or features not supported across databases are deprecated and documented as such\r\n\r\n\r\nIf A is planned for 3.0 we can update doc in 2.x according to B.\r\n\r\nIn case of update() alias argument it can be clarified in these places:\r\n- https://www.doctrine-project.org/projects/doctrine-dbal/en/2.8/reference/query-builder.html#set-clause\r\n- https://github.com/doctrine/dbal/blob/master/lib/Doctrine/DBAL/Query/QueryBuilder.php#L550-L561\r\n\r\nCan also remove alias usage in this examples to avoid (miss-)leading people to use this:\r\n- https://github.com/doctrine/dbal/blob/master/lib/Doctrine/DBAL/Query/QueryBuilder.php#L744-L789\r\n\r\n\r\nWhich other QueryBuilder features are affected?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doctrine/dbal/issues/3302/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doctrine/dbal/issues/3302/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"not_planned"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":5559094360,"node_id":"LE_lADOAApWWM4J4d5LzwAAAAFLWQxY","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doctrine/dbal/issues/events/5559094360","actor":{"login":"morozov","id":59683,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5Njgz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/59683?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/morozov","html_url":"https://github.com/morozov","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/morozov/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/morozov/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/morozov/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/morozov/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/morozov/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/morozov/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/morozov/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/morozov/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/morozov/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-11-03T01:50:54Z","label":{"name":"Bug","color":"e11d21"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":5559094361,"node_id":"LE_lADOAApWWM4J4d5LzwAAAAFLWQxZ","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doctrine/dbal/issues/events/5559094361","actor":{"login":"morozov","id":59683,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5Njgz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/59683?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/morozov","html_url":"https://github.com/morozov","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/morozov/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/morozov/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/morozov/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/morozov/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/morozov/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/morozov/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/morozov/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/morozov/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/morozov/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-11-03T01:50:55Z","label":{"name":"QueryBuilder","color":"bfe5bf"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doctrine/dbal/issues/comments/1238961825","html_url":"https://github.com/doctrine/dbal/issues/2451#issuecomment-1238961825","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doctrine/dbal/issues/2451","id":1238961825,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAApWWM5J2Q6h","user":{"login":"morozov","id":59683,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5Njgz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/59683?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/morozov","html_url":"https://github.com/morozov","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/morozov/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/morozov/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/morozov/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/morozov/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/morozov/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/morozov/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/morozov/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/morozov/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/morozov/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-09-07T06:27:53Z","updated_at":"2022-09-07T06:27:53Z","body":"Query builder is just a string builder on steroids.
