issue originally created by user KingCrunch:\n\nHi,\n\nI use https://github.com/realestateconz/MssqlBundle to connect to an MSSQL-database and I'd like to provide the connection parameters as URL. Because `dblib` is not a supported driver I setup the `driverClass` instead\n\n```\ndriver_class:   \\Realestate\\MssqlBundle\\Driver\\PDODblib\\Driver\n```\n\nSo the corresponding URL would look like\n\n```\n//user:pass@127.0.0.1/dabasename\n```\n\nBut now it tries to connect to the database `/databasename` instead of `databasename`. I can set an arbitrary scheme here as long as it exists and is supported (and is not SQLite) \n\n```\nmysqli://user:pass@127.0.0.1/dabasename\n```\n\nNow it works, but it's a hack.\n\nIt seems, that the issue is here\nhttps://github.com/doctrine/dbal/blob/32b1a4f85a078f67752851c27be4065071db1f8b/lib/Doctrine/DBAL/DriverManager.php#L262\nAs long as there is no scheme the leading slash remains. I'd guess, that it should also take into account, that there might be no driver name, but a concrete `driverClass` instead\n\n```\n(!isset($url['scheme']) && !isset(isset($url['driverClass']))\n```\n\n?\n","closed_by":{"login":"Ocramius","id":154256,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1NDI1Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/154256?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ocramius","html_url":"https://github.com/Ocramius","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ocramius/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ocramius/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ocramius/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ocramius/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ocramius/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ocramius/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ocramius/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ocramius/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ocramius/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doctrine/dbal/issues/1183/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doctrine/dbal/issues/1183/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
