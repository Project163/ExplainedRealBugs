am using the schema generation tool to generate create/update scripts for my database from yaml entities.\r\nUsing http://docs.doctrine-project.org/projects/doctrine-dbal/en/latest/reference/types.html#datetime as a guide, I have a date column of type 'date', which correctly generates an oracle column with type DATE.\r\nHowever, when I try to generate update scripts, OraclePlatform::doctrineTypeMappings maps the oracle DATE to a doctrine DateTimeType. The columns are seen as different because DateType != DateTimeType.\r\nIf I change the mapping date->datetime to date->date, it correctly sees that the database column matches the entity definition.\r\n\r\nI think this is a bug, although minor since the update sql is generated from the entity definition and ends up being a no-op.","closed_by":{"login":"Ocramius","id":154256,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1NDI1Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/154256?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ocramius","html_url":"https://github.com/Ocramius","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ocramius/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ocramius/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ocramius/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ocramius/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ocramius/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ocramius/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ocramius/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ocramius/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ocramius/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doctrine/dbal/issues/2555/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/doctrine/dbal/issues/2555/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
