DBAL currently checks for substring `mariadb` in the version constraint and returns the \"default\" MySQL platform if found (this happen only on autodetection of course). If you want/need to explicitly set the server version, use a MySQL version number that MariaDB depends on to get the most suitable platform. So in your case `5.6` would be correct.\nPlease note that DBAL does not have official MariaDB support yet. It only contains some patches like the version evaluation thing mentioned, to be _rather_ compatible.\n\nHope this helps for
