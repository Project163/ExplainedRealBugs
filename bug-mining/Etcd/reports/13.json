Now, there comes an issue with Goreman not initiating the etcd cluster as the Procfile indicates  /bin/etcd and not /usr/local/bin [(as indicated here)](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/blob/edd011c6d1f8b9c80d22a2c4c78b81fce3861437/Procfile#L2) The following error then gets logged out:\r\n\r\n`19:26:46 etcd1 | /bin/sh: 1: bin/etcd: not found`\r\n\r\nThe same happens for Procfile.learner also. A solution I have found is to then modify the Procfile & Procfile.learner by replacing /bin/etcd to /usr/local/bin/etcd\r\n\r\nIs this modification alright to get Goreman running easily or is there a possibility that the path to where the etcd release gets moved to gets changed from /usr/local/bin to /bin?\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"jingyih","id":23108879,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMTA4ODc5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/23108879?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jingyih","html_url":"https://github.com/jingyih","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jingyih/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jingyih/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jingyih/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jingyih/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jingyih/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jingyih/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jingyih/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jingyih/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jingyih/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/etcd-io/etcd/issues/11329/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/etcd-io/etcd/issues/11329/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
