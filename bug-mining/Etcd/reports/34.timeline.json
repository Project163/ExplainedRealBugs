What type of PR is this?\r\n\r\n/kind cleanup\r\n/kind flake\r\n\r\n#### What this PR does / why we need it:\r\n\r\nChoosing a port in advance is racy. A better solution is to use a Unix Domain\r\nsocket in the per-etcd-instance data directory. Then the name can be determined\r\nin advance and there's no risk of conflicts with other etcd instances.\r\n\r\n### Notes to reviewers\r\n    \r\nWith unix:// for the endpoint, we have to be a bit more careful about\r\npassing a TLS config to the etcd client library because for unix://, in\r\ncontrast to http://, it tries to use an incomplete config which\r\nthen fails to establish the connection.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Which issue(s) this PR fixes:\r\nRelated-to: https://kubernetes.slack.com/archives/C09QZ4DQB/p1744360811926169\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n    === RUN   TestSchedulerPerf/SteadyStateClusterResourceClaimTemplateFirstAvailable/fast\r\n    {\"level\":\"warn\",\"ts\":\"2025-04-11T03:32:06.676527Z\",\"caller\":\"embed/config.go:689\",\"msg\":\"Running http and grpc server on single port.
