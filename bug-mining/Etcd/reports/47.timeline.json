Motivation\r\n[Issue 14671](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/issues/14827)\r\n\r\n# Changes\r\n1. `TestGoFiles` & `XTestGoFiles` added in shell func `go_srcs_in_module`. \r\n2. Test file comments fixes as per `goword`.\r\n\r\n# Summary\r\nThe shell func `go_srcs_in_module` which originally was listing only go src files is made to list go test files too. This is used by `verify-license-header` which checks for copyright headers in go files. Making the func to list test files will help in identifying the go test files that miss copyright headers. \r\n\r\nGo template terminology:\r\n    1. `GoFiles` - for go source files\r\n    2. `TestGoFiles` - for go test files which share the same package names\r\n    3. `XTestGoFiles` - for go test files that belong to `_test` packages\r\n> TestGoFiles & XTestGoFiles are added as part of this change.\r\n\r\nAs `go_srcs_in_module` is used by other verifications too, the comments in different tests are fixed to make it `verify-goword` compliant.\r\n\r\n# Related Issues\r\nCloses #14827 ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/etcd-io/etcd/issues/14840/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/etcd-io/etcd/issues/14840/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":7881003413,"node_id":"CE_lADOAKtHts5XDllbzwAAAAHVvpGV","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/etcd-io/etcd/issues/events/7881003413","actor":{"login":"ahrtr","id":30739825,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwNzM5ODI1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/30739825?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahrtr","html_url":"https://github.com/ahrtr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahrtr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahrtr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahrtr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahrtr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahrtr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahrtr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahrtr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahrtr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahrtr/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-11-23T22:03:22Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":7881003488,"node_id":"REFE_lADOAKtHts5XDllbzwAAAAHVvpHg","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/etcd-io/etcd/issues/events/7881003488","actor":{"login":"ahrtr","id":30739825,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwNzM5ODI1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/30739825?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahrtr","html_url":"https://github.com/ahrtr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahrtr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahrtr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahrtr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahrtr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahrtr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahrtr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahrtr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahrtr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahrtr/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"b6a35947100f98920e4adbb80f475f08a44cdff7","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/etcd-io/etcd/commits/b6a35947100f98920e4adbb80f475f08a44cdff7","created_at":"2022-11-23T22:03:23Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
