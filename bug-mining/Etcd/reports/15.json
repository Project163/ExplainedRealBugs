Experiments with tmpfs on linux suggest that most of the time in my tests is spent writing to disk. Unfortunately macOS does not have a tmpfs, and standard dev/CI environments do not have one configured so typically the tests are slow, dominated by ephemeral etcd writes.\r\n\r\n### Proposal\r\n\r\nAdd an unsafe `--nosync` flag to etcd that disables fsync.\r\n\r\nThe implementation is straightforward as the underlying bbolt already exposes options for this, `NoSync` and `NoFreelistSync`, it's a matter of plumbing them through.\r\n\r\nI would be happy to implement this if the idea is generally acceptable.","closed_by":{"login":"gyuho","id":6799218,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY3OTkyMTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6799218?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gyuho","html_url":"https://github.com/gyuho","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gyuho/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gyuho/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gyuho/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gyuho/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gyuho/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gyuho/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gyuho/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gyuho/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gyuho/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/etcd-io/etcd/issues/11930/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/etcd-io/etcd/issues/11930/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
