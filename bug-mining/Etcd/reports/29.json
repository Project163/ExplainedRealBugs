So I used [goleak](https://github.com/uber-go/goleak) to guard all test functions (`main` branch) and run `PASSES=unit ./test`. I finally found a test leaking goroutines:\r\n\r\n```\r\n--- FAIL: TestEtcdGrpcResolver (4.43s)\r\n    resolver_test.go:51: Cannot create clusters in --short tests\r\n     leak.go:117: Test appears to have leaked :\r\n         google.golang.org/grpc.(*Server).Serve.func1(0xc00042ee00)\r\n         \t/root/go/pkg/mod/google.golang.org/grpc@v1.37.0/server.go:715 +0xe5\r\n         google.golang.org/grpc.(*Server).Serve(0xc00042ee00, 0x18485f0, 0xc0004a11a0, 0x0, 0x0)\r\n         \t/root/go/pkg/mod/google.golang.org/grpc@v1.37.0/server.go:769 +0x88a\r\n                created by go.etcd.io/etcd/pkg/v3/grpc_testing.(*StubServer).Start\r\n        \t/root/actions-runner/_work/path/to/etcd/pkg/grpc_testing/stub_server.go:53 \r\nFAIL\r\nFAIL\tgo.etcd.io/etcd/tests/v3/integration/clientv3/naming\t39.512s\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn normal situations, there should be no alive goroutines after a test function  finished. Is this goroutine leak intentional or expected?
