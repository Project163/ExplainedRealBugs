Maybe @chalin has some time to look into this eventually?\r\n\r\n> The client2 can't acquire the lock, because the lock has been acquired by the client1. And this is the same result when testing locally.\r\n\r\nYep, I think that's not working anymore. I reckon that the gogc has changed significantly over time and it's not as easy to \"stop the world\" anymore. In fact, running `GODEBUG=gcstoptheworld=2 ./client 1` does panic for me in 1.18.2. \r\n\r\nEither way, you could manually revoke the lease on client 1 using `etcdctl lease revoke` and it would work as advertised.\r\n\r\n> Why do version verification in the storage server?\r\n> If doing this, from the second time on, running the client.go will definitely report an error. Because the values of session.Lease() are different.\r\n\r\nAs far as I can read the code, you have to restart the server as it will keep the leases under the same key `key0` and thus run into issues in subsequent runs. \r\n\r\nWithin one run however, only client 2 should win the write with its lease id, which is why client 1 will receive the entirely expected error on writing the same key under a different lease id. This just tests that client 1 will not be able to successfully write with an expired lease. Maybe you're more familiar with this under the name of an optimistic concurrency etag write, which is usually handled server side.\r\n","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/etcd-io/etcd/issues/comments/1189355772/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"tjungblu","id":85170409,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg1MTcwNDA5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/85170409?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tjungblu","html_url":"https://github.com/tjungblu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tjungblu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tjungblu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tjungblu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tjungblu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tjungblu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tjungblu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tjungblu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tjungblu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tjungblu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":7022598134,"node_id":"MEE_lADOAKtHts5NxO-NzwAAAAGilFf2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/etcd-io/etcd/issues/events/7022598134","actor":{"login":"chalin","id":4140793,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQxNDA3OTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4140793?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chalin","html_url":"https://github.com/chalin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chalin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chalin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chalin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chalin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chalin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chalin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chalin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chalin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chalin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-07-19T17:19:45Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":7022598144,"node_id":"SE_lADOAKtHts5NxO-NzwAAAAGilFgA","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/etcd-io/etcd/issues/events/7022598144","actor":{"login":"chalin","id":4140793,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQxNDA3OTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4140793?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chalin","html_url":"https://github.com/chalin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chalin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chalin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chalin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chalin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chalin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chalin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chalin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chalin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chalin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-07-19T17:19:45Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":7022598149,"node_id":"MEE_lADOAKtHts5NxO-NzwAAAAGilFgF","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/etcd-io/etcd/issues/events/7022598149","actor":{"login":"SimFG","id":21985684,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxOTg1Njg0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21985684?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SimFG","html_url":"https://github.com/SimFG","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SimFG/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SimFG/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SimFG/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SimFG/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SimFG/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SimFG/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SimFG/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SimFG/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SimFG/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-07-19T17:19:45Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":7022598155,"node_id":"SE_lADOAKtHts5NxO-NzwAAAAGilFgL","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/etcd-io/etcd/issues/events/7022598155","actor":{"login":"SimFG","id":21985684,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxOTg1Njg0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githu
