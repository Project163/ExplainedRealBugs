 feature is a good idea. we are facing the same issue.\r\nWe write a service that can switch `master` and `slave` via etcd lock\r\nand do not want to block the service. so we also need a `tryLock` method to periodically check lock status.\r\nwe found that when lease was expired, the lock method also blocked. \r\npseudo code like following\r\n```\r\nFuture<id> future = lease.grant(15); // 15 seconds\r\nlong leaseId = future.get();\r\nFuture<String> lockFuture = lock.lock(\"some lock\", leaseId);\r\nlockFuture.get(); // blocking here, when lease is expired, also blocking here\r\n// lockFuture.get(5, TimeUnit.SECONDS); this will not block invoke, but the server also runing lock method\r\n```\r\n@jingyih @technoweenie @bmizerany @xiang90 \r\nIs there a way to implement the
