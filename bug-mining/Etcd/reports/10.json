In my program where I make use of the etcd embed package, I was using this to create a custom zap logger and have all components of my program to use this logger and create the same output (it is logfmt format instead of json).\r\n\r\nI was wondering if there would be any issue/concern with allowing this field to still be exposed so that the underlying zap logger can be replaced?","closed_by":{"login":"gyuho","id":6799218,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY3OTkyMTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6799218?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gyuho","html_url":"https://github.com/gyuho","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gyuho/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gyuho/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gyuho/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gyuho/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gyuho/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gyuho/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gyuho/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gyuho/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gyuho/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/etcd-io/etcd/issues/11144/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/etcd-io/etcd/issues/11144/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
