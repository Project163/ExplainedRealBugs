specified, will attach it.\r\n\r\nHowever, if the client call update with the same lease, this will detach and attach again.\r\n\r\nIn fact, if the old lease equals a new lease, we need to do nothing.\r\n\r\nLike this:\r\n```go\r\nfunc (tw *storeTxnWrite) put(key, value []byte, leaseID lease.LeaseID) {\r\n    \r\n    // ...\r\n    \r\n   if oldLease == leaseID {\r\n        return\r\n   }\r\n\r\n    if oldLease != lease.NoLease {\r\n\t\tif tw.s.le == nil {\r\n\t\t\tpanic(\"no lessor to detach lease\")\r\n\t\t}\r\n\t\terr = tw.s.le.Detach(oldLease, []lease.LeaseItem{{Key: string(key)}})\r\n\t\tif err != nil {\r\n\t\t\ttw.storeTxnRead.s.lg.Error(\r\n\t\t\t\t\"failed to detach old lease from a key\",\r\n\t\t\t\tzap.Error(err),\r\n\t\t\t)\r\n\t\t}\r\n\t}\r\n    // and if
