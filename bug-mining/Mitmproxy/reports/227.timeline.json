Problem Description\r\n\r\nI have a relatively large addon written as a package consisting of several modules. One of the modules (`main.py`) serves as the addon entrypoint which I load with the `-s` flag (`mitmdump -s main.py`). The rest of the modules in the package are imported by `main.py`.\r\n\r\nI would like mitmproxy/mitmdump to reload my addon completely when any of the addon's modules change (or their mtime changes). So, for instance, when I make a change in modules `foo.py` or `bar/baz.py`, which are used by the module `main.py`, I would like that these changes are automatically reflected in the running mitmdump session.\r\n\r\nIs this possible in current mitmproxy? I've seen some hints in old issues that there might be ways to specify which files it should watch but the documentation doesn't seem to mention it and all the code that the issues were referencing is old and doesn't seem to exist anymore.\r\n\r\nCan I achieve this, and if yes, how?\r\n\r\n#### Steps to reproduce the behavior:\r\n\r\n1. Create a mitmproxy script `main.py`, which imports/depends on `foo.py` and `bar/baz.py` which are located in the same directory.\r\n2. Load `main.py` as a script in mitmproxy/mitmdump via the `-s` flag.\r\n3. Do some changes to `foo.py` or `bar/baz.py`.\r\n4. Observe that `main.py` *did not* get reloaded and the changes are not reflected.\r\n\r\n#### System Information\r\n```\r\n❯ mitmproxy --version\r\n\r\nMitmproxy: 5.2\r\nPython:    3.8.6\r\nOpenSSL:   OpenSSL 1.1.1h  22 Sep 2020\r\nPlatform:  Linux-5.4.72-1-lts-x86_64-with-glibc2.2.5\r\n```\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/issues/4253/reactions","total_count":5,"+1":4,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":1},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/issues/4253/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
