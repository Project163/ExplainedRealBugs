discussed with @cortesi on slack, right now whenever a user's script throws an error due to various reasons, it is being handled at different places differently.\r\nTherefore we can have a consistent error handler function which can be invoked whenever there is an error\r\nThis will also handle #2837 #2838 #2839 \r\n### Function\r\n\r\nSignature\r\n`script_error(path, message, lineno, exception)`\r\n\r\nWhat function will do\r\n>\"Error in script XXX:NNN MMM” where XXX is the path as specified by the user (the .path attribute of Script), NNN is a line number if we have one, and MMM is a short message\r\n\r\nThe idea here is to display the above mentioned message in the console app and display the traceback related to the error in the event log.
