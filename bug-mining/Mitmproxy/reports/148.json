This info is available during a live mitmproxy session.\n\nUsing `FlowReader` programmatically should also expose the `flow.server_conn.cert` as well. It's empty.\n##### What went wrong?\n\nThere's no SSL info available when loading flows from a log.\n##### Any other comments?\n\nThe cert info does seem to be in the log if you manually inspect it. Doesn't seem to matter if you record the flow with `mitmdump` or `mitmproxy`\n\n---\n\nMitmproxy Version: 0.16\nOperating System: OS X 10.11.4\n","closed_by":{"login":"mhils","id":1019198,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMTkxOTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1019198?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils","html_url":"https://github.com/mhils","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/issues/1067/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/issues/1067/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
