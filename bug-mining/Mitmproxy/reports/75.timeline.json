However, CloudFront raises an SSL alert for connections without SNI, which kind of breaks our OpenSSL workaround. To cope for this, we now temporarily suppress the first failure and hope for a SNI from the client. If that doesn't happen, we raise the original error again.\n\nCheers,\nMax\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/issues/comments/66985838/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"mhils","id":1019198,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMTkxOTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1019198?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils","html_url":"https://github.com/mhils","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":207567953,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MjA3NTY3OTUz","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/issues/events/207567953","actor":{"login":"gfrench17","id":9209723,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyMDk3MjM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9209723?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gfrench17","html_url":"https://github.com/gfrench17","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gfrench17/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gfrench17/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gfrench17/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gfrench17/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gfrench17/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gfrench17/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gfrench17/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gfrench17/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gfrench17/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2014-12-15T12:12:51Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":207567954,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDIwNzU2Nzk1NA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/issues/events/207567954","actor":{"login":"gfrench17","id":9209723,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyMDk3MjM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9209723?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gfrench17","html_url":"https://github.com/gfrench17","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gfrench17/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gfrench17/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gfrench17/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gfrench17/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gfrench17/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gfrench17/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gfrench17/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gfrench17/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gfrench17/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2014-12-15T12:12:51Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/issues/comments/66985911","html_url":"https://github.com/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/issues/427#issuecomment-66985911","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/issues/427","id":66985911,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY2OTg1OTEx","user":{"login":"mhils","id":1019198,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMTkxOTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1019198?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils","html_url":"https://github.com/mhils","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-12-15T12:13:36Z","updated_at":"2014-12-15T12:13:36Z","body":"cc

The client, firefox 36.0.1 runs on Windows 8.1 Pro.\n\nAn example mitmdump with \"SSL handshake error: The client may not trust the proxy's certificate.\" messages is here: http://www.blaeu.com/uploads/1303\n\nDo you think this is this due to the SNI problem you described above?
