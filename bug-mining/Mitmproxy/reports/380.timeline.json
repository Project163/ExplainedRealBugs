you explain the use-case you see for this?\r\n\r\nspecifically, a reverse-proxy looks like a regular server to a client, so no client should ever send `Proxy-Authorization` headers to it, even if asked to.\r\nconsider https://docs.mitmproxy.org/stable/concepts-modes/#reverse-proxy\r\n\r\ni can  only guess that you are hoping to use mitmproxy to provide authentication for the service it's reverse-proxying?\r\nin that case, proxy authentication is the wrong protocol to use.\r\nit would probably be possible to write some code that has mitmproxy perform regular http authentication, if one
