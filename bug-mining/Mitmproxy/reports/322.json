Run mitmproxy on a publicly routable host, with default configuration including `listen_host=\"\"`, `listen_port=8080`, and `allow_remote=false`.\r\n2. From a host on a different network, send a request through that instance of mitmproxy, e.g. with `curl --proxy http://your-host.example:8080`\r\n\r\nThe default `allow_remote=false` should prevent this request from succeeding. However, it is served by mitmproxy just fine.\r\n\r\n##### Any other comments? What have you tried so far?\r\n\r\nI have a laptop sitting in the “DMZ” of a home router, which is globally IPv4 routable. I also have a VPS which is globally IPv4 routable. Both the laptop and the VPS are running Ubuntu 16.04 “Xenial Xerus”. I can reproduce the problem with mitmproxy running on the VPS and curl on the laptop, as well as vice-versa.\r\n\r\nBoth tcpdump and mitmproxy’s own Details pane show the request as originating from a remote network.\r\n\r\nI only noticed this because I saw strange flows in a mitmproxy instance that I spun up on the laptop.\r\n\r\n##### System information\r\n\r\nMitmproxy: 3.0.3 binary\r\nPython:    3.5.2\r\nOpenSSL:   OpenSSL 1.1.0g  2 Nov 2017\r\nPlatform:  Linux-4.4.0-116-generic-x86_64-with-debian-stretch-sid\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"cortesi","id":22544,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNTQ0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22544?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cortesi","html_url":"https://github.com/cortesi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cortesi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cortesi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cortesi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cortesi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cortesi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cortesi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cortesi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cortesi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cortesi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/issues/3024/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/issues/3024/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
