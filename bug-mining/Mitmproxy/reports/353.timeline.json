it's incoming buffer\r\n* and the server might have already sent a few more before having canceled the stream\r\n\r\nThe problem here seems to be that the client thinks the stream is already closed. Receiving `DATA` frames on a closed streams causes a `h2.exceptions.StreamClosedError`\r\nhttps://github.com/python-hyper/hyper-h2/blob/306609aa72c5ad4860a72fc4caa5db9ef5ab5b26/h2/stream.py#L317\r\n\r\nThis exception is then swallowed and replaced with more generic error handling\r\nhttps://github.com/python-hyper/hyper-h2/blob/306609aa72c5ad4860a72fc4caa5db9ef5ab5b26/h2/connection.py#L1487\r\n\r\nThis means the client is completely unaware that it just tried to process a `DATA` frame, yet it did!\r\nSince there was no proper `DataReceived` event for the user to handle, nobody will call `acknowledge_received_data` to update the flow control and send a `WINDOW_UPDATE`.\r\n\r\nNow we have effectively starved the whole h2 connection because one \"rogue\" stream was taking all the available connection flow window and nobody is able to update it because the information about the `DATA` frame is swallowed by the exception handling.\r\n\r\n*A short PoC script*\r\nIt wraps one of the `H2Connection` functions to add a debug print for the root cause and it prints the remaining flow window size. After a few seconds this will go to 0, and therefore halting all streams in the connection.\r\n\r\nThe expected output of the script is a continuous output of `DATA` frames of stream 1, every second or so, with 61 bytes, and then many smaller ones for the additional requests.\r\n\r\nIf you call the script without any CLI args, it only create the first continuous stream, just to demontrate that the `acknowledge_received_data` works in principle.\r\n\r\nIf you call the script with a single CLI arg `foo`, the script will generate a few more requests, and then send a `RST_STREAM` shortly after. This causes a lot of unprocessed `DATA` frames to be swallowed, and the input flow window will shortly after be starved to 0.\r\n\r\n```\r\n#!/usr/bin/env python3\r\n\r\nimport certifi\r\nimport
