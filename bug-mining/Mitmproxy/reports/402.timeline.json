The curl version I'm using is curl 7.19.7 (i486-pc-linux-gnu) libcurl/7.19.7 OpenSSL/0.9.8k zlib/1.2.3.3 libidn/1.15 (Pretty old, I know). Requests made with curl --tlsv1 (which is the option for my curl version) end up with the following error:\r\n\r\nerror:14090086:SSL routines:SSL3_GET_SERVER_CERTIFICATE:certificate verify failed.\r\n\r\nI'm using a cert with the --certs option that I created by chaining the certificate, private key and the certificate chain. Although curl does not work, another software that is also performing requests is able to use the proxy without issue. \r\n\r\nwget fails tough.\r\n\r\nShould I include the root certificate? or something like that as well?","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/issues/comments/973670623/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"Juanpam","id":8345151,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgzNDUxNTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8345151?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Juanpam","html_url":"https://github.com/Juanpam","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Juanpam/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Juanpam/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Juanpam/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Juanpam/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Juanpam/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Juanpam/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Juanpam/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Juanpam/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Juanpam/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":5642707051,"node_id":"MEE_lADOAAfumM455H6ezwAAAAFQVOBr","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/issues/events/5642707051","actor":{"login":"mhils","id":1019198,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMTkxOTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1019198?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils","html_url":"https://github.com/mhils","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-11-19T02:28:58Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":5642707054,"node_id":"SE_lADOAAfumM455H6ezwAAAAFQVOBu","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/issues/events/5642707054","actor":{"login":"mhils","id":1019198,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMTkxOTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1019198?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils","html_url":"https://github.com/mhils","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-11-19T02:28:58Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
