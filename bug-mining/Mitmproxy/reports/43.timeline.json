We'll expose a command line switch to filter by hostname, ip and port. If you think that this is not sufficient for your usecase, please let me know.\n\nTesting still involves [mitmproxy from git master](https://github.com/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/issues/50#issuecomment-34479477) and manually [editing the source code](https://github.com/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/blob/master/libmproxy/proxy.py#L358) right now. As soon as we have the command line switch exposed and documentation added, we'll post a short update here.\n\nCheers,\nMax\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/issues/comments/34581132/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"mhils","id":1019198,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMTkxOTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1019198?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils","html_url":"https://github.com/mhils","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/issues/comments/35057976","html_url":"https://github.com/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/issues/175#issuecomment-35057976","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/issues/175","id":35057976,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM1MDU3OTc2","user":{"login":"timesking","id":1159474,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTk0NzQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1159474?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/timesking","html_url":"https://github.com/timesking","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timesking/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timesking/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timesking/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timesking/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timesking/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timesking/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timesking/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timesking/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timesking/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-02-14T05:43:20Z","updated_at":"2014-02-14T05:43:20Z","body":"A great news, it is.

In regular mode,\n                        only SSL traffic is ignored and the hostname should be\n                        used.

As a simple workaround, I'd recommend \n\n```\ngit clone https://github.com/mitmproxy/netlib.git\ngit clone https://github.com/mitmproxy/mitmproxy.git\ncd netlib\npip install -e .\ncd ../mitmproxy\npip install -e .\n```\n\nPlease let me know whether that works for you! :-)\n\nPicking the right regex obviously depends on your target. If you run `mitmproxy -v` and open the event log, you'll see `serverconnect` messages, which display the `host:port` string on which mitmproxy will filter. If your ignore pattern matches, you'll see a message in the log:\n\n```\n127.0.0.1:56995: serverconnect\n  -> securemetrics.apple.com:443\n127.0.0.1:56995: Ignore host: securemetrics.apple.com:443\n```\n\nA few examples:\n\nRunning mitmproxy in regular mode, the very lazy approach is \n`--ignore apple.com`, \nwhich ignore HTTP and HTTPS traffic for foo.apple.com, apple.com and even appletcom.org (. matches everything in regexes).\nTo only intercept HTTPS traffic, one could use\n`--ignore apple.com:443`.\nIf you coincidentally want to connect to appletcom.org, the correct version would leave that out by escaping the dot:\n`--ignore apple\\.com:443`.\nNow let's say you don't want to match the subdomains (not even www.):\n`--ignore ^apple\\.com:443`\netc. I think you should get the idea. That being said, the story is a little bit different in transparent mode - we don't have qualified hostnames here, only IPs:\n`--ignore 17\\.178\\.96\\.59:443`\n\nCheers,\nMax\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/issues/comments/54221158/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"mhils","id":1019198,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMTkxOTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1019198?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils","html_url":"https://github.com/mhils","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":160268835,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MTYwMjY4ODM1","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/issues/events/160268835","actor":{"login":"Gotmymoney","id":8632387,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg2MzIzODc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8632387?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Gotmymoney","html_url":"https://github.com/Gotmymoney","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Gotmymoney/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Gotmymoney/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Gotmymoney/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Gotmymoney/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Gotmymoney/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Gotmymoney/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Gotmymoney/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Gotmymoney/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Gotmymoney/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2014-09-02T21:34:09Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":160268836,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDE2MDI2ODgzNg==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/issues/events/160268836","actor":{"login":"Gotmymoney","id":8632387,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg2MzIzODc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8632387?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Gotmymoney","html_url":"https://github.com/Gotmymoney","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Gotmymoney/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Gotmymoney/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Gotmymoney/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Gotmymoney/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Gotmymoney/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Gotmymoney/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Gotmymoney/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Gotmymoney/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Gotmymoney/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2014-09-02T21:34:09Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/issues/comments/54237041","html_url":"https://github.com/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/issues/175#issuecomment-54237041","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/issues/175","id":54237041,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU0MjM3MDQx","user":{"login":"Gotmymoney","id":8632387,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg2MzIzODc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8632387?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Gotmymoney","html_url":"https://github.com/Gotmymoney","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Gotmymoney/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Gotmymoney/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Gotmymoney/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Gotmymoney/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Gotmymoney/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Gotmymoney/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Gotmymoney/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Gotmymoney/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Gotmymoney/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-09-03T00:23:40

The difference in the UI has been an oversight and is fixed.\nRegarding your problem: If you open the event log (`e`), you should be able to see `clientconnect` messages.

If you can observe clientconnect messages, try starting mitmproxy with `-v` and see whether there's anything meaningful in the
