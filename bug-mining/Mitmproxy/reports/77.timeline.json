Really appreciated. :smile: \nYour analysis is spot-on. I just commited a fix that mitigates this issue by setting `timeout` to 0.1. I'm not 100% happy with that, but it seems to be a good compromise that works on Linux and Windows. I now get about 1-2% CPU usage with a minor performance degradation. As soon as we move to Python 3, we should reconsider this decision - `Condition` does a single select call there.

am using mitmdump in a transparent mode.  Some requests are passed through a small script which takes the request data and stores it in a MongoDB collection.\n\nI have noticed a fresh startup of mitmproxy sits at about 1 to 2% CPU usage, even before the first request comes in.  After running for a week or two, it will sit at about 3 to 4% CPU, and will accumulate a rather large memory footprint.\n\nI am not sure what debugging info to provide for this sort of problem.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/issues/484/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/issues/484/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"actor":{"login":"mhils","id":1019198,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMTkxOTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1019198?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils","html_url":"https://github.com/mhils","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-05-04T18:00:10Z","updated_at":"2016-05-04T18:00:10Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/issues/1112","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mitmproxy/mitmproxy","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/issues/1112/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/issues/1112/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/issues/1112/events","html_url":"https://github.com/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/issues/1112","id":152924808,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWUxNTI5MjQ4MDg=","number":1112,"title":"Please
