Problem Description\r\nPiping mitmdump output to another program and exiting that latter program before it has read all of mitmdump's output produces a *lot* of `BrokenPipeError: [Errno 32] Broken pipe` errors.\r\n\r\n#### Steps to reproduce the behavior:\r\n1. Capture a non-trivial amount of traffic: `mitmdump -w outfile`; the nature of the traffic (HTTP/HTTPS/WebSocket) does not seem to matter. The outfile has to be large enough for the next command to produce enough output that the pipe buffer gets backlogged.\r\n2. Print the contents of the dump file and pipe it to something like `less`: `mitmdump -nr outfile | less`\r\n3. Quit `less` with the `q` key.\r\n4. mitmdump produces a traceback similar to the following for every record in the outfile that has not been consumed by `less` prior to quitting:\r\n\r\n```\r\nAddon error: Traceback (most recent call last):\r\n  File \".../lib/python3.8/site-packages/mitmproxy/addons/termlog.py\", line 31, in log\r\n    click.secho(\r\n  File \".../lib/python3.8/site-packages/click/termui.py\", line 548, in secho\r\n    return echo(message, file=file, nl=nl, err=err, color=color)\r\n  File \".../lib/python3.8/site-packages/click/utils.py\", line 273, in echo\r\n    file.flush()\r\nBrokenPipeError: [Errno 32] Broken pipe\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\nAddon error: Traceback (most recent call last):\r\n  File \".../lib/python3.8/site-packages/mitmproxy/addons/dumper.py\", line 263, in websocket_message\r\n    self.echo(f.message_info(message))\r\n  File \".../lib/python3.8/site-packages/mitmproxy/addons/dumper.py\", line 70, in echo\r\n    click.secho(text, file=self.outfp, **style)\r\n  File \".../lib/python3.8/site-packages/click/termui.py\", line 548, in secho\r\n    return echo(message, file=file, nl=nl, err=err, color=color)\r\n  File \".../lib/python3.8/site-packages/click/utils.py\", line 273, in echo\r\n    file.flush()\r\nBrokenPipeError: [Errno 32] Broken pipe\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Attempted workarounds and possible solution\r\nThe obvious workaround is to first make the second program consume everything and only then quit. For example, with `less`, pressing `G` to scroll to the bottom of the output before quitting. However, since `less` keeps everything in memory, this may not be feasible for large dump files.\r\n\r\nKilling metadump with `^C` after quitting `less` does not seem to help.\r\n\r\nFor this particular use case of displaying file information, the ideal solution would be to simply exit on a `BrokenPipeError`. This would also mean that the rest of the dump file would not be processed, needlessly wasting CPU time. But the general case is probably rather to disable all further output to stdout but keep processing (e.g. if a dump file is being filtered into another file).\r\n\r\n#### System Information\r\n```\r\n$ mitmproxy --version\r\nMitmproxy: 5.1.1 (+2, commit a8ca63f)\r\nPython:    3.8.2\r\nOpenSSL:   OpenSSL 1.1.1g  21 Apr 2020\r\nPlatform:  Linux-5.6.0-1-amd64-x86_64-with-glibc2.29\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is a current Debian sid system. The `(+2, commit a8ca63f)` info on the mitmproxy version is a bug (#3987) and can be disregarded; this is a clean 5.1.1

reading from an existing dump.\r\n\r\n#### Steps to reproduce the behavior:\r\n1. Capture WebSocket traffic: `mitmdump -w infile ~websocket`\r\n2. Apply a filter of `~websocket`: `mitmdump -nr infile -w outfile ~websocket`\r\n\r\nThe result is a non-empty `infile`, which contains the expected WebSocket messages, and an **empty** `outfile` even though they should contain the same data.\r\n\r\nIn addition, I also noticed that `mitmdump -nr infile` produces no output whatsoever, even with `-v` to increase the verbosity. I'm aware that the UI does not properly support WebSocket (#1020), but I'd expect it to at least report that messages exist as it does during dumping (i.e. `127.0.0.1:57466 -> WebSocket 1 message -> URL` etc.). This does not happen when the initial capturing is done without a filter, i.e. those \"message\" log lines appear in that case. This might point at a more fundamental issue with reading back the WebSocket data than just the filtering.\r\n\r\n#### System Information\r\n```\r\n$ mitmproxy --version\r\nMitmproxy: 5.1.1 (+2, commit a8ca63f)\r\nPython:    3.8.2\r\nOpenSSL:   OpenSSL 1.1.1g  21 Apr 2020\r\nPlatform:  Linux-5.6.0-1-amd64-x86_64-with-glibc2.29\r\n```\r\n\r\n(Regarding the version number, see #3987; this is a clean 5.1.1 installation.)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/issues/3990/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/issues/3990/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/issues/comments/625988687","html_url":"https://github.com/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/issues/3987#issuecomment-625988687","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/issues/3987","id":625988687,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYyNTk4ODY4Nw==","user":{"login":"mhils","id":1019198,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMTkxOTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1019198?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils","html_url":"https://github.com/mhils","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-05-08T19:49:54Z","updated_at":"2020-05-08T19:49:54Z","body":"Thanks for the detailed report.
