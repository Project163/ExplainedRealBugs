But we also see\r\n```\r\n[13:43:57.805][127.0.0.1:57442]       << Receive(RequestEndOfMessage(stream_id=7))\r\n```\r\nin the logs from\r\nhttps://github.com/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/blob/f45d6e970b05935e311b3a63e28261ea494f7105/mitmproxy/proxy/layers/http/_http1.py#L117\r\n\r\njust two lines above. So there _must_ be some sort of race. That was very confusing as we spent a lot of effort to make sure the proxy core is _not_ multi-threaded (https://mitmproxy.org/posts/new-proxy-core/). So these issues shouldn't exist by design. 😅\r\n\r\nLooking closer at the logs I found that we're starting to handle a second event in the middle of handling the first one. And I eventually realized that this happens because eager task execution kind of acts like an `await` as it pauses the current method to first execute a different task. I then built the test in #7031 to validate my assumptions and implemented a fix. :)\r\n\r\nThank you again for the fantastic logs! 🍰
