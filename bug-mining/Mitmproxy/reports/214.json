Start mitmproxy with no flags\r\n2. `curl -v -u testuser:testpass --proxy localhost:8080 http://httpbin.org/basic-auth/testuser/testpass`\r\n3. `curl -v --proxy localhost:8080 http://httpbin.org/get`\r\n\r\n##### Expected Outcome\r\nThe second request does not contain an authorization header.\r\n\r\n##### Actual Outcome\r\nThe second request does contain an authorization header.\r\n\r\n##### Any other comments? What have you tried so far?\r\nThis is causing issues when proxying requests to a domain where the auth type changes (context switching). The behaviour observed above does not occur when running curl without the proxy.\r\n\r\n##### System information\r\nMitmproxy version: 0.18.2\r\nPython version: 2.7.12\r\nPlatform: Darwin-14.5.0-x86_64-i386-64bit\r\nSSL version: OpenSSL 1.0.2j  26 Sep 2016\r\nMac version: 10.10.5 ('', '', '') x86_64\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"mhils","id":1019198,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMTkxOTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1019198?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils","html_url":"https://github.com/mhils","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/issues/1850/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/issues/1850/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
