It's weird how `k` became a tuple.\nI check the code around `libmproxy/console/__init__.py`:616 and have no idea about this output.\n\nOccasionally, it would stuck without crashing and even `^C` lost its function. At this situation, I used `top` to track the CPU / Mem usage but it seemed to be fine.\n\nI remembered that I didn't get this when I installed the git version of mitmproxy for the first time. It might relate to recent changes.\n","closed_by":{"login":"cortesi","id":22544,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNTQ0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22544?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cortesi","html_url":"https://github.com/cortesi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cortesi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cortesi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cortesi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cortesi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cortesi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cortesi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cortesi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cortesi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cortesi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/issues/522/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/issues/522/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
