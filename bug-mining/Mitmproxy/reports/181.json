Start mitmdump with the following inline script:\n\n``` python\ndef request(flow):\n    if flow.request.host == \"google.com\":\n        flow.request.host = \"example.com\"\n```\n1. Use a HTTP2-capable browser to open https://google.com\n##### What is the expected behavior?\n\nRequests should be redirected to example.com.\n##### What went wrong?\n\nRequests are answered by google.com, even though the UI indicates example.com.\n##### Any other comments? What have you tried so far?\n\nThis issue can be mitigated by passing `--no-http2`.\nImplementing host change for HTTP2 is super tricky, so we may not go for this right now. \nHowever, the user should get a visible notification when changing hosts and the request should probably be aborted.\n\n---\n\nMitmproxy Version: master\nOperating System: Win10 x64\n","closed_by":{"login":"mhils","id":1019198,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMTkxOTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1019198?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils","html_url":"https://github.com/mhils","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/issues/1430/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/issues/1430/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
