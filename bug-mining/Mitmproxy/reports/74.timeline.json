may be more a netlib issue than mitmproxy, but I want to gather information about when a client doesn't like a self-signed cert or mismatched hostname.\n\nThe ssl connection for the client (and otherwise) looks to happen here:\nnetlib/tcp.py -> convert_to_ssl\n\nI would assume on a bad handshake with the client (the client doesn't like the cert) an error is thrown in libmproxy/proxy/server.py at this call:\n\n``` python\n            self.client_conn.convert_to_ssl(\n                cert, key,\n                handle_sni=self.handle_sni,\n

throwing an error based on netlib/test/test_tcp.py:\n\n``` python\nclass TestServerCipherListError(test.ServerTestBase):\n    handler = ClientCipherListHandler\n    ssl = dict(\n        cert = tutils.test_data.path(\"data/server.crt\"),\n        key = tutils.test_data.path(\"data/server.key\"),\n        request_client_cert = False,\n        v3_only = False,\n        cipher_list = 'bogus'\n

To cover the ssl-terminating case, you can specify `http2https://example.com:80/` (or vice versa) as proxy specification.

Strictly speaking, the feature is working as intended:\n\n<pre>> python mitmdump -d -R http2https://www.gmail.com/\n127.0.0.1:50457: clientconnect\n127.0.0.1 GET https://www.gmail.com/\n    Host: <b>localhost:8082</b>\n    User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.3; WOW64; rv:30.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/30.0\n    Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,*/*;q=0.8\n    Accept-Language: de,en-US;q=0.7,en;q=0.3\n    Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate\n    Connection: keep-alive\n &lt;&lt; 404 Not Found 1.39kB\n    Content-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8\n    Content-Length: 1425\n    Date: Tue, 08 Jul 2014 17:48:31 GMT\n    Server: GFE/2.0\n</pre>\n\nThis behaviour is perfectly fine for a normal reverse proxy. However, your case is special as your proxy is not an \"official/expected\" reverse proxy - the `Host` header doesn't match the the upstream server's expectations.\n\nIn other words, you need to override the Host header manually to get it working:\n`mitmdump -R http2https://www.gmail.com --setheader :~q:Host:www.gmail.com:` (see mitmproxy's [filter syntax](http://mitmproxy.org/doc/features/filters.html))\nNote that this still doesn't catch HTTP redirects etc, which possibly redirect your client to the real machine (as it is the case with gmail). DNS spoofing or /etc/hosts would be the way to go then.\n\nCheers,\nMax\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/issues/comments/48375581/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"mhils","id":1019198,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMTkxOTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1019198?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils","html_url":"https://github.com/mhils","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":139362089,"node_id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDEzOTM2MjA4OQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/issues/events/139362089","actor":{"login":"mhils","id":1019198,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMTkxOTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1019198?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils","html_url":"https://github.com/mhils","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2014-07-08T17:56:26Z","label":{"name":"docs","color":"5319e7"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":139362261,"node_id":"MDE3OlJlbmFtZWRUaXRsZUV2ZW50MTM5MzYyMjYx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/issues/events/139362261","actor":{"login":"mhils","id":1019198,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMTkxOTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1019198?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils","html_url":"https://github.com/mhils","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"renamed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2014-07-08T17:56:50Z","rename":{"from":"SSL

Max,\n\nWould it be possible to do something like this:\n\n```\nmitmproxy -R https2http://\\*:80\n```\n\nThe idea would be that it would match all SSL traffic and redirect it to http, for multiple domains. The use would be for testing SSL when developing locally. Granted it works if the URL that is accessed in the browser is `https://localhost:8080` and the command is `mitmproxy -R https2http://localhost:80` - but my issue is that I have multiple local domain names setup in my `/etc/hosts` file.\n\nBasically it throws this error:\n\n> You attempted to reach `https://sandbox`, but instead you actually reached a server identifying itself as `https://localhost`\n\nI checked out the [Reverse Proxy Documentation Issue](https://github.com/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/issues/304) and the [SSL23_GET_CLIENT_HELLO](https://github.com/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/issues/311) issues, and I realize that the `https2http` / `http2https` features are still undocumented but was still not able to figure this out.\n\nI guess this could be the issue with the `CONNECT` before `REQUEST` way that the SSL handshake works? ... basically that the server name has to be specified via the command line since the hostname is not sent with the `CONNECT` ?\n\nHowever, with the [Complication 3: Server Name Indication](http://mitmproxy.org/doc/howmitmproxy.html) it looks like there are some possible workarounds. Are they already built in or would this have to be something we would need to write?\n\nThanks!\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/issues/317/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/issues/317/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":204528369,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MjA0NTI4MzY5","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/issues/events/204528369","actor":{"login":"mhils","id":1019198,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMTkxOTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1019198?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils","html_url":"https://github.com/mhils","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":"ffb95a1db742d71d7671f9e9c6db552774bb0ead","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/commits/ffb95a1db742d71d7671f9e9c6db552774bb0ead","created_at":"2014-12-08T23:01:18Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
