I've tried to modify the scheme and other things but mitmproxy still continues to send a TLS client hello after the initial upstream CONNECT. \r\n\r\nIt appears that this is currently unsupported in mitmproxy?\r\n\r\n##### Steps to reproduce the problem:\r\n\r\nuplink.py:\r\n\r\n```\r\nfrom mitmproxy import ctx\r\n\r\ndef http_connect(flow):\r\n        flow.request.scheme = 'http'\r\n        flow.request.port = 80\r\n        ctx.log.info('script: connect '+repr(flow))\r\n\r\ndef request(flow):\r\n        flow.request.scheme = 'http'\r\n        flow.request.port = 80\r\n        ctx.log.info('script: request '+repr(flow))\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n1. socat -v tcp-listen:8082,reuseaddr,fork  TCP:upstreamproxy:999\r\n2. mitmproxy -p 8081 -s uplink.py -U http://localhost:8082 --insecure --no-upstream-cert\r\n3. curl -v -k -x http://127.0.0.1:8081 https://www.google.com\r\n\r\nThe output of socat is:\r\n\r\n```\r\n> 2017/05/11 10:11:56.527763  length=119 from=0 to=118\r\nCONNECT www.google.com:80 HTTP/1.1\\r\r\nHost: www.google.com:443\\r\r\nUser-Agent: curl/7.51.0\\r\r\nProxy-Connection: Keep-Alive\\r\r\n\\r\r\n< 2017/05/11 10:11:56.720058  length=116 from=0 to=115\r\nHTTP/1.1 200 OK\\r\r\nContent-Length: 0\\r\r\nDate: Thu, 11 May 2017 08:11:56 GMT\\r\r\nContent-Type: text/plain; charset=utf-8\\r\r\n\\r\r\n> 2017/05/11 10:11:56.753419  length=164 from=119 to=282\r\n............i..RF+,Q..2.=.......\r\noA5T].Lt....2.,.+.$.#.\r\n.       .0./.(.'.........k.g.9.3.....=.<.5./.....@.\\v.......\r\n.......#...\\r. ........................................< 2017/05/11 10:11:56.753987  length=82 from=116 to=197\r\nHTTP/1.1 502 Uplink Bad Gateway\\r\r\nContent-Length: 131\\r\r\nContent-Type: text/plain\\r\r\n\\r\r\n< 2017/05/11 10:11:56.754159  length=131 from=198 to=328\r\nmalformed HTTP request \"\\\\x16\\\\x03\\\\x01\\\\x00\\\\x9f\\\\x01\\\\x00\\\\x00\\\\x9b\\\\x03\\\\x03\\\\xd2i\\\\xe3\\\\xacRF+,Q\\\\xa4\\\\xec2\\\\xfe=\\\\x11\\\\x11\\\\xf1\\\\xfe\\\\xcf\\\\x0e\\\\u007f\"^C⏎\r\n```\r\n\r\nAs you can see above, the TLS client hello `\\\\x16\\\\x03\\\\x01\\\\x00` is sent. The upstream proxy doesn't like it and replies with error 502.\r\n\r\n##### Expected behavior\r\n\r\nIf configured/scripted, mitmproxy should send upstream HTTP bytes for a HTTPS URL.\r\n\r\n##### Any other comments? What have you tried so far?\r\n\r\nI also tried some variants of uplink.py, also the script from issue #1731 for example. I also tried switching off `--insecure` or `--no-upstream-cert`. I'm currently using those flags because Burp (which I actually intend to use instead of curl) apparently doesn't send SNI [properly](https://support.portswigger.net/customer/portal/questions/16827939-burp-does-not-set-sni-on-the-outgoing-connection-to-an-ssl-enabled-web-server).\r\n\r\n##### System information\r\n\r\n```\r\nMitmproxy version: 2.0.2 (1.2.0dev0000-0x8cba0352e)\r\nPython version: 3.6.1\r\nPlatform: Darwin-16.5.0-x86_64-i386-64bit\r\nSSL version: OpenSSL 1.1.0e  16 Feb 2017\r\nMac version: 10.12.4 ('', '', '') x86_64\r\n```","closed_by":{"login":"mhils","id":1019198,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMTkxOTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1019198?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils","html_url":"https://github.com/mhils","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/issues/2329/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/issues/2329/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
