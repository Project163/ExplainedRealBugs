of data sent and received. It uses mitmproxy to do a \"man-in-the-middle attack\" and the CA certificate used for signing is embedded in the container that all the scrapers run on.\n\nI definitely want to help you get your issue fixed @pudo as soon as possible. It would be great if you could supply a failing bit of minimal code that I can use for testing - something that fails on morph but works when you run it locally. Then I can test it on a local VM with and without the proxying and see if the problem is due to mitmproxy.\n\nThanks!\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openaustralia/morph/issues/734/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openaustralia/morph/issues/734/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
