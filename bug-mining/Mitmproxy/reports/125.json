Open a HTML webpage in Chinese with mitmproxy.\n2. Switch to the _Response_ page and view the content.\n### What is the expected behavior?\n\nShould display the content like \n\n``` html\n<meta name=\"description\" content=\"中文字符\"/>\n```\n\ninstead of\n\n``` html\n<meta name=\"description\" content=\"&#20013;&#25991;&#23383;&#31526;\"/>\n```\n### What went wrong?\n\nI guess `libmproxy.contentviews.ViewHTML` should be improved to fix this. \n### Any other comments?\n\nIt's really confusing seeing whole screen of these unicodes instead of the correct characters. Hope we can fix this soon!\n","closed_by":{"login":"mhils","id":1019198,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMTkxOTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1019198?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils","html_url":"https://github.com/mhils","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/issues/835/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/issues/835/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
