#1120 turned out to be surprisingly difficult from a UI/UX perspective. The key problem is that if we just display `OPTIONS *`, a user cannot associate the request with a host in the flow list:\n\n```\nλ mitmdump\n127.0.0.1:52407: clientconnect\n127.0.0.1 OPTIONS *                   <- this goes where?\n << 200 OK 0B\n```\n\nTo fix this, I'd like to display `OPTIONS * (example.com)` in the UI. There are two ways to accomplish this:\n1. Let `request.url` return the stuff in the parantheses as well.(https://github.com/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/compare/issue-1120)\n2. Manually add them in the UI part. (https://github.com/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/compare/issue-1120-alt)\n\nI personally prefer the second solution even though it is way more verbose code-wise.
