Use a setup such as redirect_requests.py\r\n2. Send a keepalive request into MITM\r\n3. This is passed onto the upstream server and response returned (fine)\r\n4. Wait a little while - upstream closes the connection with a FIN\r\n5. (MITMproxy did not respond to this)\r\n6. Wait a bit longer and send another request to MITM\r\n7. MITM attempts to send this to the upstream which responds with a RST\r\n8. Client sees a 502 bad gateway error\r\n\r\n##### Any other comments? What have you tried so far?\r\nIn our case we were using https://www.npmjs.com/package/json-server#cli-usage as the upstream server but it appears to be complying with keepalive docs.  Just very surprised we are the only people seeing this :-)\r\n\r\nWorkaround for us was to add flow.request.headers['Connection'] = 'close', this closed the upstream connection after each request.\r\n\r\n\r\n```\r\nGET /config HTTP/1.1\r\nHost: 127.0.0.1\r\nConnection: keep-alive\r\nCache-Control: max-age=0\r\nUpgrade-Insecure-Requests: 1\r\nUser-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Linux; Android 7.1.1; Android SDK built for x86 Build/NYC) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/55.0.2883.91 Mobile Safari/537.36\r\nAccept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,image/webp,*/*;q=0.8\r\nAccept-Encoding: identity\r\nAccept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.8\r\n\r\nHTTP/1.1 200 OK\r\nX-Powered-By: Express\r\nVary: Origin, Accept-Encoding\r\nAccess-Control-Allow-Credentials: true\r\nCache-Control: no-cache\r\nPragma: no-cache\r\nExpires: -1\r\nX-Content-Type-Options: nosniff\r\nContent-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8\r\nContent-Length: 4094\r\nETag: W/\"ffe-YXiFVkdRXmM5eFcp/fDfl4O1X+w\"\r\nDate: Wed, 04 Apr 2018 12:53:09 GMT\r\nConnection: keep-alive\r\n\r\n{\r\n  \"content\": {\r\n....\r\n}\r\n\r\n[ NB: FIN is sent by upstream and received by MITM here]\r\n\r\nGET /config HTTP/1.1\r\nHost: 127.0.0.1\r\nConnection: keep-alive\r\nCache-Control: max-age=0\r\nUpgrade-Insecure-Requests: 1\r\nUser-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Linux; Android 7.1.1; Android SDK built for x86 Build/NYC) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/55.0.2883.91 Mobile Safari/537.36\r\nAccept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,image/webp,*/*;q=0.8\r\nAccept-Encoding: identity\r\nAccept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.8\r\nIf-None-Match: W/\"ffe-YXiFVkdRXmM5eFcp/fDfl4O1X+w\"\r\n \r\n[ RST now received]\r\n```\r\n\r\n##### System information\r\n\r\nMitmproxy: 3.0.3 \r\nPython:    3.6.5\r\nOpenSSL:   OpenSSL 1.0.2o  27 Mar 2018\r\nPlatform:  Darwin-17.5.0-x86_64-i386-64bit\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"mhils","id":1019198,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMTkxOTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1019198?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils","html_url":"https://github.com/mhils","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/issues/3038/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/issues/3038/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
