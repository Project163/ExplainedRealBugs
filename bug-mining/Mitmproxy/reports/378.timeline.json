use mitmproxy for interactive browsing a lot.\r\nthat is, i run an mitmdump instance continuously, and use it from multiple browsers on multiple computers.\r\n\r\nrecently this started to be a rather frustrating experience.\r\ni suspect it's related to the new proxy core,\r\nor it could be related to debian upgrading to python 3.9? sadly it turned out non-trivial to roll this back.\r\n\r\ninitially after mitmproxy startup, everything works smoothly, but then suddenly stalls,\r\nmany requests hang for a very long time until mitmproxy returns a response.\r\nsometimes this starts almost immediately, sometimes after hours,\r\nit possibly recovers by itself, but usually i give up waiting and restart mitmproxy.\r\n(most times the requests seem to do finish, but only after many minutes.)\r\nthis is probably most easily reproduced with resource-heavy sites, like facebook.com, openstreetmap.org, ...\r\n\r\nin netstat, i don't see mitmproxy having many connections to the destination servers open, so i suspect it's an internal limitation.\r\n( i typically check with `$ netstat -ntp | grep EST.*python  | grep -v :8080 | awk '{print $5}' | sort | uniq -c | sort -n`)\r\n\r\nmy initial suspicion was that there is a limit on the number of concurrent connections, and that that pool is used up by connections that are in some invalid state and/or waiting for a timeout.\r\n\r\ni already found a per-connection.address] limit at\r\nhttps://github.com/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/blob/dc6c5f55cd25236e9469c24b85c8cafd29573281/mitmproxy/proxy/server.py#L84\r\nand increased it significantly, but that did not lead to consistent improvements.\r\n(i also added a warning on `if self.max_conns[command.connection.address].locked():`, but it doesn't seem to trigger.)\r\n\r\ncan you suggest what else i could do to diagnose this?\r\nis there another connection limit besides `max_conns` in proxy?\r\nis there existing code/facilities to introspect/dump the currently open incoming connections and their state?\r\nan option to log connection-level tracing info?\r\n\r\n\r\n#### System Information\r\nPaste the output of \"mitmproxy --version\"

mentioned in #4451 , but i don't think it's related to the issue discussed there and should get a separate ticket)\r\n\r\n#### Problem Description\r\ni use mitmdump for interactive browsing a lot.\r\nthat is, i run an mitmdump instance continuously, and use it from multiple browsers on multiple computers.\r\n\r\ni find that mitmdump's memory usage constantly grows,\r\nit *appears* as if it allocates memory for any request/response data it processes and then never frees it.\r\nnote that i would _expect_ this behaviour from mitmproxy running interactively, as it displays all the data in the UI,\r\nbut mitmdump should have no reason to keep flows in memory after writing them out.\r\n\r\nhere's a typical mitmdump memory usage graph out of my monitoring stack:\r\n![mitmdump_rss](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2834981/108147170-b9efb380-70ce-11eb-8389-89997a72cb5b.png)\r\n\r\nmitmdump memory usage appears as a sawtooth pattern, rising until it's terminated.\r\nthe growth rate is currently typically around 500mb/hour, it was less in the past, when it got through a whole day with under 2gb,\r\nand is higher than the rate of data actually dumped (under 1gb/day). \r\nin this graph mitmdump is manually terminated a few times, because of debugging #4451, and by a daily restart at midnight.\r\n(i also run a script that terminates it if it exceeds 3gb, to avoid it taking down my system.)\r\n\r\nsome very rare phases of non-growth (as seen in the graph above) are very unlikely related to zero traffic - thanks to websites constantly loading stuff in the background nowadays, and many browsers and tabs, it's unlikely that traffic is ever zero.\r\n\r\ni see some _extremely_ rare occurences (at most once a week) of larger amounts of memory being allocated and freed again, in the expected pattern of allocating it to handle a request, and freeing it again after the request is finished.\r\n\r\n#### Steps to reproduce the behavior:\r\n1. run mitmdump for a longer period and use it, possibly with multiple browsers with a large number of tabs open  \r\n2. observe memory usage\r\n\r\n#### System Information\r\ni think it has been the case ever since i started using mitmproxy, the above graph is of current git master. (running with `--set proxy_debug -vvv`, but it doesn't make a difference to the behaviour.)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/issues/4456/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/issues/4456/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
