saw [issue 328](https://github.com/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/issues/328) but I'm still confused. It looks like \n`change_server` should be able to be used with inline scripts. Is that correct?\n\nBasically, how can I have one SSL host handle requests for a different SSL host? i.e. make all requests for `https://www.bing.com/` load corresponding resources from `https://www.google.com/` ?\n\nI'm using a build from the master branch. Here's are the scripts I tried:\n\n```\ndef serverconnect(context, flow):\n    flow.live.change_server( ('google.com', '443') )\n\ndef request(context, flow):\n    flow.live.change_server( ('google.com', '443') )\n```\n\nThose lines are in a file like `scripts.py` that gets referenced with `mitmproxy -s /path/to/scripts.py`\n\nRequests continue through the `serverconnect` hook although they do not seem to affect the remote host etc. Adding the line in the `request` hook causes the request to crash - although I'm not sure how I can tell `mitmproxy` that I want to see the exact errors generated.\n\nWhat am I doing wrong?
