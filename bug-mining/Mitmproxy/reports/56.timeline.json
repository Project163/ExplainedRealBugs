I'm playing around with mitmproxy and trying to set up Transparent mode. Having some troubles, unfortunately. My setup is this: dd-wrt router, Mac OS X Mavericks (running mitmproxy 0.9.2), iPhone (target machine). \n\nOn my router I've forwarded traffic from iPhone to mitmproxy, and it's making it there correctly as shown below with nc:\n\n```\n    [ob1@pax :: /tmp]$ nc -l 8080\n    GET / HTTP/1.1\n    Host: yahoo.com\n    Connection: keep-alive\n    <etc, snip>\n```\n\nHowever, it isn't requesting the entire URL because, well, I'm unable (unwilling?) to input the proxy into proxy settings because I don't want the app I'm testing to \"know\" it's being proxied.\n\nThis causes the following error in mitmproxy event log:\n\n```\n192.168.15.1:58507: connect\n192.168.15.1:58507: 502: Transparent mode failure: could not resolve original destination.\n192.168.15.1:58507: disconnect\n  -> handled 0 requests\n```\n\nWhich causes the connection to get dropped.  I've read about the sudo issue with OS X and made sure to use sudo within 5 minutes of starting up mitmproxy, no dice. I don't think it's an issue with my iptables configuration on the router, but in case that's the problem, here's what I'm using there:\n\n```\n#!/bin/sh\nPROXY_IP=192.168.15.25\nPROXY_PORT=8080\nLAN_IP=`nvram get lan_ipaddr`\nLAN_NET=$LAN_IP/`nvram get lan_netmask`\n\niptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -i br0 -s 192.168.15.148 -d $LAN_NET -p tcp --dport 80 -j ACCEPT\niptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -i br0 -s 192.168.15.148 -p tcp --dport 80 -j DNAT --to $PROXY_IP:$PROXY_PORT\niptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -i br0 -s 192.168.15.148 -p tcp --dport 443 -j DNAT --to $PROXY_IP:$PROXY_PORT\niptables -t nat -I POSTROUTING -o br0 -s $LAN_NET -d $PROXY_IP -p tcp -j SNAT --to $LAN_IP\niptables -I FORWARD -i br0 -o br0 -s $LAN_NET -d $PROXY_IP -p tcp --dport $PROXY_PORT -j ACCEPT\n```\n\nThe command I'm using to start mitmproxy is:\n\n```\nmitmproxy -T --host\n```\n\nAnd lastly, because I wanted to make sure I followed all the available directions, I did what http://mitmproxy.org/doc/transparent/osx.html told me to in regards to enabling ip forwarding and the pf configuration.\n\nIs this a bug or am I doing something incorrectly? Many thanks!\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/issues/296/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/issues/296/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":162145817,"node_id":"MDEzOkFzc2lnbmVkRXZlbnQxNjIxNDU4MTc=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/issues/events/162145817","actor":{"login":"mhils","id":1019198,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMTkxOTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1019198?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils","html_url":"https://github.com/mhils","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"assigned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2014-09-06T22:08:49Z","assignee":{"login":"mhils","id":1019198,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMTkxOTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1019198?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils","html_url":"https://github.com/mhils","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/issues/comments/54731527","html_url":"https://github.com/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/issues/255#issuecomment-54731527","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/issues/255","id":54731527,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU0NzMxNTI3","user":{"login":"mhils","id":1019198,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMTkxOTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1019198?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils","html_url":"https://github.com/mhils","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-09-06T23:06:44Z","updated_at":"2014-09-06T23:06:44Z","body":"The
