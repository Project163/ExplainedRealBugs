Visual Studio Code and Sublime Text when put in the EDITOR variable fail to work (Sublime Text opens the file but does not show the file contents as it should), and the only alternative is NVIM, but some people prefer using their mouse to get around\r\n\r\nGitHub link to file: https://github.com/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/blob/main/mitmproxy/tools/console/master.py\r\n\r\n#### Steps to reproduce the behavior:\r\n1.
