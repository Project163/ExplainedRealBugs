In upstream mode, mitmproxy assumes a regular proxy upstream, not a transparent one.\n\nLet me know if that works for you.

thanks so much for the quick response! Per your suggestion I tried unchecking the box for `Enable transparent HTTP proxying` but I'm still not having any luck. What options should I be using at the command line?\n\nI'm not afraid to do some testing if you can point me in the right direction. Although python isn't my language of choice, I did spent several hours going through the `proxy.py` file and attempting (hackishly) to debug by writing variables to a named pipe ( a la `pprint(vars(self.server_conn), stream=the_file)` ). \n\n(I think that) I understand how the SSL proxying works. I have been using Charles by itself for a long time. I've been reading up on mitmproxy and have been through most of the `libmproxy` source and am really comfortable with this whole concept:\n\n<img src=\"http://mitmproxy.org/doc/explicit_https.png\" >\n\nWith two SSL proxies both doing this it seems that the one connecting to the website would be able to communicate with the site using it's own cert signing, and then the proxy that was communicating with the browser would also do the same thing - so this should work, right?\n\nI also noticed that if I set the proxy to `-U \"https://localhost:8888\"` which means \"hey, use Charles as a the upstream proxy and communicate with it via SSL\" - and then if I visit a plain (HTTP) website I get:\n\n```\nProxyError(ProxyError(...), \"SSL handshake error: [('SSL routines', 'SSL3_GET_RECORD', 'wrong version number')]\")\n```\n\nSo that sort of looks like `mitmproxy` does not like the cert that Charles is issuing to it.\n\nDoes `mitmproxy` have something that is similar to `curl`'s `-k, --insecure` which does not verify the proxy's cert? I was attempting to figure out how to edit the `proxy.py` file to test that theory.\n\nThanks for your help.\n","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/issues/comments/50252268/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"clarkewd","id":156377,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1NjM3Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/156377?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clarkewd","html_url":"https://github.com/clarkewd","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clarkewd/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clarkewd/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clarkewd/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clarkewd/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clarkewd/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clarkewd/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clarkewd/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clarkewd/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clarkewd/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/issues/comments/50252609","html_url":"https://github.com/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/issues/313#issuecomment-50252609","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/issues/313","id":50252609,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUwMjUyNjA5","user":{"login":"mhils","id":1019198,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMTkxOTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1019198?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils","html_url":"https://github.com/mhils","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-07-27T00:52:30Z","updated_at":"2014-07-27T00:52:30Z","body":"Hi

for a little more detailed response :-)\n\nFirst: I added a fix for your issue and verified that mitmproxy is working with Charles now. If you update mitmproxy to git master, simply specifying `mitmproxy -U http://localhost:8888/` should work.\n\nLet me answer your other questions raised here as well:\n\n> I don't think I can try \"socks5://localhost:8888\" (yet)\n\ncorrect (and linked to the right issue)\n\n> I see that in the 0.11 there is something regarding a new protocol - 2https - is that something that could be used to achieve this?\n\nusing the https2http:// syntax, mitmproxy can terminate SSL connections in a reverse proxy scenario (or vice versa). In other words, one could use mitmproxy to \"sslify\" any HTTP website.\n\n> With two SSL proxies both doing this it seems that the one connecting to the website would be able to communicate with the site using it's own cert signing, and then the proxy that was communicating with the browser would also do the same thing - so this should work, right?\n\nyep. `browser <---> proxy 1 <---> proxy 2 <---> server`, each `<--->` represents an isolated end-to-end SSL connection.\n\n> I also noticed that if I set the proxy to -U \"https://localhost:8888\"\n\nStrictly speaking, there's no thing such as a HTTP<b>S</b> proxy. We have an HTTP proxy upstream that understands CONNECT requests (and tunnels data afterwards). In the case of mitmproxy, we intercept as well, but that's a different story :stuck_out_tongue: This is why a https upstream proxy doesn't work/makes no sense.\n\n> Does mitmproxy have something that is similar to curl's -k, --insecure which does not verify the proxy's cert? I was attempting to figure out how to edit the proxy.py file to test that theory.\n\nmitmproxy does not attempt to validate upstream certificates at all, so it's `--insecure` by default.\n\nIf you have any further questions, let me know!\n\nCheers,\nMax\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/issues/comments/50253217/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"mhils","id":1019198,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMTkxOTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1019198?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils","html_url":"https://github.com/mhils","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/issues/comments/50256277","html_url":"https://github.com/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/issues/313#issuecomment-50256277","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/issues/313","id":50256277,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUwMjU2Mjc3","user":{"login":"clarkewd","id":156377,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1NjM3Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/156377?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clarkewd","html_url":"https://github.com/clarkewd","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clarkewd/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clarkewd/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clarkewd/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clarkewd/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clarkewd/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clarkewd/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clarkewd/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clarkewd/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clarkewd/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-07-27T05:20:32Z","updated_at":"2014-07-27T05:20:32Z","body":"very
