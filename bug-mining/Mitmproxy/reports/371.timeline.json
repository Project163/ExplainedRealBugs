Steps to reproduce the problem:\r\n\r\n1. Download and extract Linux binaries from https://github.com/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/releases/download/v4.0.1/mitmproxy-4.0.1-linux.tar.gz\r\n2. sudo ./mitmweb --web-iface 192.168.86.88 --web-port 8081 --showhost --listen-host 192.168.86.88 --listen-port 8080\r\n3. Generate load from an external device or from a local browser. I use MITMProxy to capture video traffic, which tears through memory rather quickly against an HLS stream like http://bitdash-a.akamaihd.net/content/sintel/hls/playlist.m3u8. You can install https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/native_hls_playback/ in Firefox to get the playback to happen natively.\r\n4. Watch the stream tear through your RAM with .ts fragments (this is expected - video is heavy).\r\n5. Clear the screen with MITMProxy --> New\r\n6. Watch the RAM usage - it won't go down, and will continue to rise when new fragments come in.\r\n\r\n##### Any other comments? What have you tried so far?\r\n\r\n- Occurs in Docker and running natively tested on both x86 and ARMv7\r\n- Reproduced in Ubuntu 18.04 LTS and Alpine 3.7 Linux. \r\n\r\nI'm wondering if there's a part of the Python API for MITMProxy that MITMWeb needs to add to the \"New\" instruction in the React code.\r\n\r\n##### System information\r\nMitmproxy: 4.0.1 binary\r\nPython:    3.6.3\r\nOpenSSL:   OpenSSL 1.1.0h  27 Mar 2018\r\nPlatform:  Linux-4.15.0-22-generic-x86_64-with-debian-buster-sid\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/issues/3191/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/issues/3191/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
