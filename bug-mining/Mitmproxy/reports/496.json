Problem Description\n\nOption allow_hosts option breaks **https** for mitmdump/mitmproxy.\n\n#### Steps to reproduce the behavior:\n\nAssuming that certificates are installed for mitmproxy: https://docs.mitmproxy.org/stable/concepts-certificates/\n\nWhen running mitmdump/mitmproxy **without** \"allow_hosts\" option, then **https** works correctly, **both** for proxy localhost address and target address:\n\n`curl --proxy https://localhost:8080/ https://my-service-url`\n\nHowever, when I start mitmdump/mitmproxy **with** \"allow_hosts\" command-line option, then **https** stops working and I have to use **http** for proxy localhost OR for target address:\n\n`curl --proxy http://localhost:8080/ https://my-service-url`\n\nalso vice-versa works (but **not both** proxy and target can have https):\n\n`curl --proxy https://localhost:8080/ http://my-service-url`\n\nConclusion: \"allow_hosts\" option should not affect the usage of **https**.\n\n#### System Information\n\n\"mitmproxy --version\" here:\n\n```\nMitmproxy: 11.1.0\nPython:    3.12.7\nOpenSSL:   OpenSSL 3.4.0 22 Oct 2024\nPlatform:
