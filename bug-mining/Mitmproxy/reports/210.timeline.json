By rewriting it as a closure factory, we were able to shave a few bytes off the final bundle size.</p>\n<h3><code>useSelector</code> Mount Optimization</h3>\n<p>A user noticed that <code>useSelector</code> had never been given an early \"bail out if the root state is the same\" check to match how <code>connect</code> works. This resulted in a usually-unnecessary second call to the provided selector on mount. We've added that check.</p>\n<h3>Entry Point Consolidation</h3>\n<p>We've consolidated the list of exported public APIs into a single file, and both the <code>index.js</code> and <code>alternate-renderers.js</code> entry points now re-export everything from that file. No meaningful change here, just shuffling lines of code around for consistency.</p>\n<h2>Other Updates</h2>\n<h3>React-Redux v8 and React 18 Development</h3>\n<p>With <a href=\"https://snyk.io/redirect/github/reactwg/react-18/discussions/4\" data-hovercard-type=\"discussion\" data-hovercard-url=\"/reactwg/react-18/discussions/4/hovercard\">the announcement of React 18</a>, we've been working with the React team to plan our migration path to keep React-Redux fully compatible with React's upcoming features.</p>\n<p>We've already <a href=\"https://snyk.io/redirect/github/reduxjs/react-redux/issues/1737\" data-hovercard-type=\"issue\" data-hovercard-url=\"/reduxjs/react-redux/issues/1737/hovercard\">migrated the React-Redux main development branch to TypeScript</a>, and are <a href=\"https://snyk.io/redirect/github/reduxjs/react-redux/pull/1808\" data-hovercard-type=\"pull_request\" data-hovercard-url=\"/reduxjs/react-redux/pull/1808/hovercard\">prototyping compatibility implementation updates</a>.  We'd appreciate any assistance from the community in testing out these changes so that we can ensure React-Redux works great for everyone when React 18 is ready!</p>\n<h3>Internal Tooling Updates</h3>\n<p>Our <code>master</code> branch now uses Yarn v2 for package management, is built with TypeScript, and we've made CI updates to test against multiple TS versions.</p>\n<p>The <code>7.x</code> branch has also been updated to use Yarn v2 for consistency.</p>\n<p>These only affect contributors to the React-Redux package itself.</p>\n<h2>Changelog</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Port entry point consolidation from 8.x branch (<a class=\"issue-link js-issue-link\" data-error-text=\"Failed to load title\" data-id=\"988346484\" data-permission-text=\"Title is private\" data-url=\"https://github.com/reduxjs/react-redux/issues/1811\" data-hovercard-type=\"pull_request\" data-hovercard-url=\"/reduxjs/react-redux/pull/1811/hovercard\" href=\"https://snyk.io/redirect/github/reduxjs/react-redux/pull/1811\">#1811</a> - <a class=\"user-mention\" data-hovercard-type=\"user\" data-hovercard-url=\"/users/markerikson/hovercard\" data-octo-click=\"hovercard-link-click\" data-octo-dimensions=\"link_type:self\" href=\"https://snyk.io/redirect/github/markerikson\">@ markerikson</a>)</li>\n<li>Update v7 branch to use Yarn v2 and improve CI process (<a class=\"issue-link js-issue-link\" data-error-text=\"Failed to load title\" data-id=\"988341843\" data-permission-text=\"Title is private\" data-url=\"https://github.com/reduxjs/react-redux/issues/1810\" data-hovercard-type=\"pull_request\" data-hovercard-url=\"/reduxjs/react-redux/pull/1810/hovercard\" href=\"https://snyk.io/redirect/github/reduxjs/react-redux/pull/1810\">#1810</a> - <a class=\"user-mention\" data-hovercard-type=\"user\" data-hovercard-url=\"/users/markerikson/hovercard\" data-octo-click=\"hovercard-link-click\" data-octo-dimensions=\"link_type:self\" href=\"https://snyk.io/redirect/github/markerikson\">@ markerikson</a>)</li>\n<li>Reduce unnecessary calls to useSelector selector (<a class=\"issue-link js-issue-link\" data-error-text=\"Failed to load title\" data-id=\"978544751\" data-permission-text=\"Title is private\" data-url=\"https://github.com/reduxjs/react-redux/issues/1803\" data-hovercard-type=\"pull_request\" data-hovercard-url=\"/reduxjs/react-redux/pull/1803/hovercard\" href=\"https://snyk.io/redirect/github/reduxjs/react-redux/pull/1803\">#1803</a> - <a class=\"user-mention\" data-hovercard-type=\"user\" data-hovercard-url=\"/users/sufian-slack/hovercard\" data-octo-click=\"hovercard-link-click\" data-octo-dimensions=\"link_type:self\" href=\"https://snyk.io/redirect/github/sufian-slack\">@ sufian-slack</a> )</li>\n<li>Port Subscription closure implementation from 8.x to 7.x (<a class=\"issue-link js-issue-link\" data-error-text=\"Failed to load title\" data-id=\"988301127\" data-permission-text=\"Title is private\" data-url=\"https://github.com/reduxjs/react-redux/issues/1809\" data-hovercard-type=\"pull_request\" data-hovercard-url=\"/reduxjs/react-redux/pull/1809/hovercard\" href=\"https://snyk.io/redirect/github/reduxjs/react-redux/pull/1809\">#1809</a> - <a class=\"user-mention\" data-hovercard-type=\"user\" data-hovercard-url=\"/users/mbelsky/hovercard\" data-octo-click=\"hovercard-link-click\" data-octo-dimensions=\"link_type:self\" href=\"https://snyk.io/redirect/github/mbelsky\">@ mbelsky</a>)</li>\n</ul>\n<p><a class=\"commit-link\" href=\"https://snyk.io/redirect/github/reduxjs/react-redux/compare/v7.2.4...v7.2.5\"><tt>v7.2.4...v7.2.5</tt></a></p>\n      </li>\n      <li>\n        <b>7.2.4</b> - <a href=\"https://snyk.io/redirect/github/reduxjs/react-redux/releases/tag/v7.2.4\">2021-04-24</a></br><p>This release drops our dependency on the core <code>redux</code> package by inlining <code>bindActionCreators</code>, and tweaks <code>useSelector</code> to ensure that selectors aren't run an extra time while re-rendering.</p>\n<h2>Changelog</h2>\n<h3>Redux Dependency Removal</h3>\n<p>React-Redux has always imported the <code>bindActionCreators</code> utility from the core <code>redux</code> package for use in <code>connect</code>. However, that meant that we had to have a peer dependency on <code>redux</code>, and this was the <em>only</em> reason we actually required that <code>redux</code> be installed. This became more annoying with the arrival of Redux Toolkit, which has its own dependency on <code>redux</code> internally, and thus users typically saw peer dependency warnings saying that \"<code>redux</code> isn't listed as a dependency in your app\".</p>\n<p>Code reuse across separate packages is a great thing, but sometimes the right thing to do is duplicate code. So, we've inlined <code>bindActionCreators</code> directly into React-Redux, and we've completely dropped the dependency on Redux. This means that React-Redux will no longer produce a peerDep warning when used with Redux Toolkit, and <code>&lt;Provider&gt;</code> and <code>connect</code> really only need a Redux-store-compatible value to work right.</p>\n<h3><code>useSelector</code> Fixes</h3>\n<p>Users reported that <code>useSelector</code> was re-running selector functions again unnecessarily while rendering after a dispatch.  We've tweaked the logic to ensure that doesn't happen.</p>\n<p><code>useSelector</code> also now has checks in development to ensure that <code>selector</code> and <code>equalityFn</code> are functions.</p>\n<h2>Changes</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Remove wrapActionCreators (<a class=\"issue-link js-issue-link\" data-error-text=\"Failed to load title\" data-id=\"854149673\" data-permission-text=\"Title

By rewriting it as a closure factory, we were able to shave a few bytes off the final bundle size.</p>\n<h3><code>useSelector</code> Mount Optimization</h3>\n<p>A user noticed that <code>useSelector</code> had never been given an early \"bail out if the root state is the same\" check to match how <code>connect</code> works. This resulted in a usually-unnecessary second call to the provided selector on mount. We've added that check.</p>\n<h3>Entry Point Consolidation</h3>\n<p>We've consolidated the list of exported public APIs into a single file, and both the <code>index.js</code> and <code>alternate-renderers.js</code> entry points now re-export everything from that file. No meaningful change here, just shuffling lines of code around for consistency.</p>\n<h2>Other Updates</h2>\n<h3>React-Redux v8 and React 18 Development</h3>\n<p>With <a href=\"https://snyk.io/redirect/github/reactwg/react-18/discussions/4\" data-hovercard-type=\"discussion\" data-hovercard-url=\"/reactwg/react-18/discussions/4/hovercard\">the announcement of React 18</a>, we've been working with the React team to plan our migration path to keep React-Redux fully compatible with React's upcoming features.</p>\n<p>We've already <a href=\"https://snyk.io/redirect/github/reduxjs/react-redux/issues/1737\" data-hovercard-type=\"issue\" data-hovercard-url=\"/reduxjs/react-redux/issues/1737/hovercard\">migrated the React-Redux main development branch to TypeScript</a>, and are <a href=\"https://snyk.io/redirect/github/reduxjs/react-redux/pull/1808\" data-hovercard-type=\"pull_request\" data-hovercard-url=\"/reduxjs/react-redux/pull/1808/hovercard\">prototyping compatibility implementation updates</a>.  We'd appreciate any assistance from the community in testing out these changes so that we can ensure React-Redux works great for everyone when React 18 is ready!</p>\n<h3>Internal Tooling Updates</h3>\n<p>Our <code>master</code> branch now uses Yarn v2 for package management, is built with TypeScript, and we've made CI updates to test against multiple TS versions.</p>\n<p>The <code>7.x</code> branch has also been updated to use Yarn v2 for consistency.</p>\n<p>These only affect contributors to the React-Redux package itself.</p>\n<h2>Changelog</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Port entry point consolidation from 8.x branch (<a class=\"issue-link js-issue-link\" data-error-text=\"Failed to load title\" data-id=\"988346484\" data-permission-text=\"Title is private\" data-url=\"https://github.com/reduxjs/react-redux/issues/1811\" data-hovercard-type=\"pull_request\" data-hovercard-url=\"/reduxjs/react-redux/pull/1811/hovercard\" href=\"https://snyk.io/redirect/github/reduxjs/react-redux/pull/1811\">#1811</a> - <a class=\"user-mention\" data-hovercard-type=\"user\" data-hovercard-url=\"/users/markerikson/hovercard\" data-octo-click=\"hovercard-link-click\" data-octo-dimensions=\"link_type:self\" href=\"https://snyk.io/redirect/github/markerikson\">@ markerikson</a>)</li>\n<li>Update v7 branch to use Yarn v2 and improve CI process (<a class=\"issue-link js-issue-link\" data-error-text=\"Failed to load title\" data-id=\"988341843\" data-permission-text=\"Title is private\" data-url=\"https://github.com/reduxjs/react-redux/issues/1810\" data-hovercard-type=\"pull_request\" data-hovercard-url=\"/reduxjs/react-redux/pull/1810/hovercard\" href=\"https://snyk.io/redirect/github/reduxjs/react-redux/pull/1810\">#1810</a> - <a class=\"user-mention\" data-hovercard-type=\"user\" data-hovercard-url=\"/users/markerikson/hovercard\" data-octo-click=\"hovercard-link-click\" data-octo-dimensions=\"link_type:self\" href=\"https://snyk.io/redirect/github/markerikson\">@ markerikson</a>)</li>\n<li>Reduce unnecessary calls to useSelector selector (<a class=\"issue-link js-issue-link\" data-error-text=\"Failed to load title\" data-id=\"978544751\" data-permission-text=\"Title is private\" data-url=\"https://github.com/reduxjs/react-redux/issues/1803\" data-hovercard-type=\"pull_request\" data-hovercard-url=\"/reduxjs/react-redux/pull/1803/hovercard\" href=\"https://snyk.io/redirect/github/reduxjs/react-redux/pull/1803\">#1803</a> - <a class=\"user-mention\" data-hovercard-type=\"user\" data-hovercard-url=\"/users/sufian-slack/hovercard\" data-octo-click=\"hovercard-link-click\" data-octo-dimensions=\"link_type:self\" href=\"https://snyk.io/redirect/github/sufian-slack\">@ sufian-slack</a> )</li>\n<li>Port Subscription closure implementation from 8.x to 7.x (<a class=\"issue-link js-issue-link\" data-error-text=\"Failed to load title\" data-id=\"988301127\" data-permission-text=\"Title is private\" data-url=\"https://github.com/reduxjs/react-redux/issues/1809\" data-hovercard-type=\"pull_request\" data-hovercard-url=\"/reduxjs/react-redux/pull/1809/hovercard\" href=\"https://snyk.io/redirect/github/reduxjs/react-redux/pull/1809\">#1809</a> - <a class=\"user-mention\" data-hovercard-type=\"user\" data-hovercard-url=\"/users/mbelsky/hovercard\" data-octo-click=\"hovercard-link-click\" data-octo-dimensions=\"link_type:self\" href=\"https://snyk.io/redirect/github/mbelsky\">@ mbelsky</a>)</li>\n</ul>\n<p><a class=\"commit-link\" href=\"https://snyk.io/redirect/github/reduxjs/react-redux/compare/v7.2.4...v7.2.5\"><tt>v7.2.4...v7.2.5</tt></a></p>\n      </li>\n      <li>\n        <b>7.2.4</b> - <a href=\"https://snyk.io/redirect/github/reduxjs/react-redux/releases/tag/v7.2.4\">2021-04-24</a></br><p>This release drops our dependency on the core <code>redux</code> package by inlining <code>bindActionCreators</code>, and tweaks <code>useSelector</code> to ensure that selectors aren't run an extra time while re-rendering.</p>\n<h2>Changelog</h2>\n<h3>Redux Dependency Removal</h3>\n<p>React-Redux has always imported the <code>bindActionCreators</code> utility from the core <code>redux</code> package for use in <code>connect</code>. However, that meant that we had to have a peer dependency on <code>redux</code>, and this was the <em>only</em> reason we actually required that <code>redux</code> be installed. This became more annoying with the arrival of Redux Toolkit, which has its own dependency on <code>redux</code> internally, and thus users typically saw peer dependency warnings saying that \"<code>redux</code> isn't listed as a dependency in your app\".</p>\n<p>Code reuse across separate packages is a great thing, but sometimes the right thing to do is duplicate code. So, we've inlined <code>bindActionCreators</code> directly into React-Redux, and we've completely dropped the dependency on Redux. This means that React-Redux will no longer produce a peerDep warning when used with Redux Toolkit, and <code>&lt;Provider&gt;</code> and <code>connect</code> really only need a Redux-store-compatible value to work right.</p>\n<h3><code>useSelector</code> Fixes</h3>\n<p>Users reported that <code>useSelector</code> was re-running selector functions again unnecessarily while rendering after a dispatch.  We've tweaked the logic to ensure that doesn't happen.</p>\n<p><code>useSelector</code> also now has checks in development to ensure that <code>selector</code> and <code>equalityFn</code> are functions.</p>\n<h2>Changes</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Remove wrapActionCreators (<a class=\"issue-link js-issue-link\" data-error-text=\"Failed to load title\" data-id=\"854149673\" data-permission-text=\"Title

By rewriting it as a closure factory, we were able to shave a few bytes off the final bundle size.</p>\n<h3><code>useSelector</code> Mount Optimization</h3>\n<p>A user noticed that <code>useSelector</code> had never been given an early \"bail out if the root state is the same\" check to match how <code>connect</code> works. This resulted in a usually-unnecessary second call to the provided selector on mount. We've added that check.</p>\n<h3>Entry Point Consolidation</h3>\n<p>We've consolidated the list of exported public APIs into a single file, and both the <code>index.js</code> and <code>alternate-renderers.js</code> entry points now re-export everything from that file. No meaningful change here, just shuffling lines of code around for consistency.</p>\n<h2>Other Updates</h2>\n<h3>React-Redux v8 and React 18 Development</h3>\n<p>With <a href=\"https://snyk.io/redirect/github/reactwg/react-18/discussions/4\" data-hovercard-type=\"discussion\" data-hovercard-url=\"/reactwg/react-18/discussions/4/hovercard\">the announcement of React 18</a>, we've been working with the React team to plan our migration path to keep React-Redux fully compatible with React's upcoming features.</p>\n<p>We've already <a href=\"https://snyk.io/redirect/github/reduxjs/react-redux/issues/1737\" data-hovercard-type=\"issue\" data-hovercard-url=\"/reduxjs/react-redux/issues/1737/hovercard\">migrated the React-Redux main development branch to TypeScript</a>, and are <a href=\"https://snyk.io/redirect/github/reduxjs/react-redux/pull/1808\" data-hovercard-type=\"pull_request\" data-hovercard-url=\"/reduxjs/react-redux/pull/1808/hovercard\">prototyping compatibility implementation updates</a>.  We'd appreciate any assistance from the community in testing out these changes so that we can ensure React-Redux works great for everyone when React 18 is ready!</p>\n<h3>Internal Tooling Updates</h3>\n<p>Our <code>master</code> branch now uses Yarn v2 for package management, is built with TypeScript, and we've made CI updates to test against multiple TS versions.</p>\n<p>The <code>7.x</code> branch has also been updated to use Yarn v2 for consistency.</p>\n<p>These only affect contributors to the React-Redux package itself.</p>\n<h2>Changelog</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Port entry point consolidation from 8.x branch (<a class=\"issue-link js-issue-link\" data-error-text=\"Failed to load title\" data-id=\"988346484\" data-permission-text=\"Title is private\" data-url=\"https://github.com/reduxjs/react-redux/issues/1811\" data-hovercard-type=\"pull_request\" data-hovercard-url=\"/reduxjs/react-redux/pull/1811/hovercard\" href=\"https://snyk.io/redirect/github/reduxjs/react-redux/pull/1811\">#1811</a> - <a class=\"user-mention\" data-hovercard-type=\"user\" data-hovercard-url=\"/users/markerikson/hovercard\" data-octo-click=\"hovercard-link-click\" data-octo-dimensions=\"link_type:self\" href=\"https://snyk.io/redirect/github/markerikson\">@ markerikson</a>)</li>\n<li>Update v7 branch to use Yarn v2 and improve CI process (<a class=\"issue-link js-issue-link\" data-error-text=\"Failed to load title\" data-id=\"988341843\" data-permission-text=\"Title is private\" data-url=\"https://github.com/reduxjs/react-redux/issues/1810\" data-hovercard-type=\"pull_request\" data-hovercard-url=\"/reduxjs/react-redux/pull/1810/hovercard\" href=\"https://snyk.io/redirect/github/reduxjs/react-redux/pull/1810\">#1810</a> - <a class=\"user-mention\" data-hovercard-type=\"user\" data-hovercard-url=\"/users/markerikson/hovercard\" data-octo-click=\"hovercard-link-click\" data-octo-dimensions=\"link_type:self\" href=\"https://snyk.io/redirect/github/markerikson\">@ markerikson</a>)</li>\n<li>Reduce unnecessary calls to useSelector selector (<a class=\"issue-link js-issue-link\" data-error-text=\"Failed to load title\" data-id=\"978544751\" data-permission-text=\"Title is private\" data-url=\"https://github.com/reduxjs/react-redux/issues/1803\" data-hovercard-type=\"pull_request\" data-hovercard-url=\"/reduxjs/react-redux/pull/1803/hovercard\" href=\"https://snyk.io/redirect/github/reduxjs/react-redux/pull/1803\">#1803</a> - <a class=\"user-mention\" data-hovercard-type=\"user\" data-hovercard-url=\"/users/sufian-slack/hovercard\" data-octo-click=\"hovercard-link-click\" data-octo-dimensions=\"link_type:self\" href=\"https://snyk.io/redirect/github/sufian-slack\">@ sufian-slack</a> )</li>\n<li>Port Subscription closure implementation from 8.x to 7.x (<a class=\"issue-link js-issue-link\" data-error-text=\"Failed to load title\" data-id=\"988301127\" data-permission-text=\"Title is private\" data-url=\"https://github.com/reduxjs/react-redux/issues/1809\" data-hovercard-type=\"pull_request\" data-hovercard-url=\"/reduxjs/react-redux/pull/1809/hovercard\" href=\"https://snyk.io/redirect/github/reduxjs/react-redux/pull/1809\">#1809</a> - <a class=\"user-mention\" data-hovercard-type=\"user\" data-hovercard-url=\"/users/mbelsky/hovercard\" data-octo-click=\"hovercard-link-click\" data-octo-dimensions=\"link_type:self\" href=\"https://snyk.io/redirect/github/mbelsky\">@ mbelsky</a>)</li>\n</ul>\n<p><a class=\"commit-link\" href=\"https://snyk.io/redirect/github/reduxjs/react-redux/compare/v7.2.4...v7.2.5\"><tt>v7.2.4...v7.2.5</tt></a></p>\n      </li>\n      <li>\n        <b>7.2.4</b> - <a href=\"https://snyk.io/redirect/github/reduxjs/react-redux/releases/tag/v7.2.4\">2021-04-24</a></br><p>This release drops our dependency on the core <code>redux</code> package by inlining <code>bindActionCreators</code>, and tweaks <code>useSelector</code> to ensure that selectors aren't run an extra time while re-rendering.</p>\n<h2>Changelog</h2>\n<h3>Redux Dependency Removal</h3>\n<p>React-Redux has always imported the <code>bindActionCreators</code> utility from the core <code>redux</code> package for use in <code>connect</code>. However, that meant that we had to have a peer dependency on <code>redux</code>, and this was the <em>only</em> reason we actually required that <code>redux</code> be installed. This became more annoying with the arrival of Redux Toolkit, which has its own dependency on <code>redux</code> internally, and thus users typically saw peer dependency warnings saying that \"<code>redux</code> isn't listed as a dependency in your app\".</p>\n<p>Code reuse across separate packages is a great thing, but sometimes the right thing to do is duplicate code. So, we've inlined <code>bindActionCreators</code> directly into React-Redux, and we've completely dropped the dependency on Redux. This means that React-Redux will no longer produce a peerDep warning when used with Redux Toolkit, and <code>&lt;Provider&gt;</code> and <code>connect</code> really only need a Redux-store-compatible value to work right.</p>\n<h3><code>useSelector</code> Fixes</h3>\n<p>Users reported that <code>useSelector</code> was re-running selector functions again unnecessarily while rendering after a dispatch.  We've tweaked the logic to ensure that doesn't happen.</p>\n<p><code>useSelector</code> also now has checks in development to ensure that <code>selector</code> and <code>equalityFn</code> are functions.</p>\n<h2>Changes</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Remove wrapActionCreators (<a class=\"issue-link js-issue-link\" data-error-text=\"Failed to load title\" data-id=\"854149673\" data-permission-text=\"Title
