Create the following 'command addon'\r\n```python\r\n# example.py\r\nfrom mitmproxy import command, ctx\r\n\r\nclass Addon:\r\n    @command.command('example.command')\r\n    def example(self):\r\n        ctx.log.info(\"doesn't work\")\r\n\r\naddons = (\r\n    Addon(),\r\n)\r\n```\r\n\r\n2. Attempt to start mitmproxy:\r\n\r\n```\r\n# mitmproxy doesn't start and exits without printing an error\r\n$ mitmproxy --verbose -s example.py\r\n$ echo $?\r\n```\r\n\r\n##### Any other comments? What have you tried so far?\r\n\r\nWhilst this is an error in the addon definition, it was actually quite annoying + difficult to track down. \r\n(The fix was to add `-> None` in the signature).\r\n\r\n##### System information\r\n\r\n```\r\nmitmproxy --version\r\nMitmproxy: 3.0.4 \r\nPython:    3.6.5\r\nOpenSSL:   OpenSSL 1.1.0h  27 Mar 2018\r\nPlatform:  Darwin-17.5.0-x86_64-i386-64bit\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"cortesi","id":22544,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNTQ0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22544?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cortesi","html_url":"https://github.com/cortesi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cortesi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cortesi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cortesi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cortesi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cortesi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cortesi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cortesi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cortesi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cortesi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/issues/3088/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/issues/3088/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
