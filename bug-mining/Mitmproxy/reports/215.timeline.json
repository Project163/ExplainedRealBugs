Steps to reproduce the problem:\r\n\r\n1. Run `mitmdump -s my_script.py`\r\n2. Start Appium\r\n3. Launch Android app\r\n4. Wait for traffic to occur\r\n5. Check the output from mitmdump\r\n\r\n##### Any other comments? What have you tried so far?\r\n\r\nI'm using Appium to automate tests in an Android device. The goal is to launch the app and then verify the right events are being sent. \r\n**my_script.py** captures the traffic and stores it in a database which is later accessed through a service that verifies payloads are valid for each request.\r\n\r\nWhen looking at the mitmdump output I can see the traffic flow, but at some point it crashes with the following information:\r\n\r\n```\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n  File \"/usr/local/projects/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/net/tcp.py\", line 211, in read\r\n    data = self.o.read(rlen)\r\n  File \"/usr/local/projects/mitmproxy/venv3.5/lib/python3.5/site-packages/OpenSSL/SSL.py\", line 1304, in recv\r\n    self._raise_ssl_error(self._ssl, result)\r\n  File \"/usr/local/projects/mitmproxy/venv3.5/lib/python3.5/site-packages/OpenSSL/SSL.py\", line 1166, in _raise_ssl_error\r\n    raise SysCallError(errno, errorcode.get(errno))\r\nOpenSSL.SSL.SysCallError: (104, 'ECONNRESET')\r\n\r\nDuring handling of the above exception, another exception occurred:\r\n\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n  File \"/usr/local/projects/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/proxy/server.py\", line 119, in handle\r\n    root_layer()\r\n  File \"/usr/local/projects/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/proxy/modes/http_proxy.py\", line 9, in __call__\r\n    layer()\r\n  File \"/usr/local/projects/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/proxy/protocol/tls.py\", line 383, in __call__\r\n    layer()\r\n  File \"/usr/local/projects/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/proxy/protocol/http1.py\", line 72, in __call__\r\n    layer()\r\n  File \"/usr/local/projects/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/proxy/protocol/http.py\", line 177, in __call__\r\n    if not self._process_flow(flow):\r\n  File \"/usr/local/projects/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/proxy/protocol/http.py\", line 246, in _process_flow\r\n    return self.handle_regular_connect(f)\r\n  File \"/usr/local/projects/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/proxy/protocol/http.py\", line 204, in handle_regular_connect\r\n    layer()\r\n  File \"/usr/local/projects/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/proxy/protocol/tls.py\", line 383, in __call__\r\n    layer()\r\n  File \"/usr/local/projects/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/proxy/protocol/http1.py\", line 72, in __call__\r\n    layer()\r\n  File \"/usr/local/projects/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/proxy/protocol/http.py\", line 177, in __call__\r\n    if not self._process_flow(flow):\r\n  File \"/usr/local/projects/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/proxy/protocol/http.py\", line 228, in _process_flow\r\n    request = self.read_request_headers(f)\r\n  File \"/usr/local/projects/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/proxy/protocol/http1.py\", line 14, in read_request_headers\r\n    http1.read_request_head(self.client_conn.rfile)\r\n  File \"/usr/local/projects/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/net/http/http1/read.py\", line 52, in read_request_head\r\n    form, method, scheme, host, port, path, http_version = _read_request_line(rfile)\r\n  File \"/usr/local/projects/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/net/http/http1/read.py\", line 240, in _read_request_line\r\n    line = _get_first_line(rfile)\r\n  File \"/usr/local/projects/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/net/http/http1/read.py\", line 227, in _get_first_line\r\n    line = rfile.readline()\r\n  File \"/usr/local/projects/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/net/tcp.py\", line 251, in readline\r\n    ch = self.read(1)\r\n  File \"/usr/local/projects/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/net/tcp.py\", line 233, in read\r\n    raise exceptions.TlsException(str(e))\r\nmitmproxy.exceptions.TlsException: (104, 'ECONNRESET')\r\n\r\nmitmproxy has crashed!\r\nPlease lodge a bug report at: https://github.com/mitmproxy/mitmproxy\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n##### System information\r\n\r\nMitmproxy version: 2.0.0 (2.0.0dev0000-0x91c3a99) \r\nPython version: 3.5.2\r\nPlatform: Linux-4.4.0-36-generic-x86_64-with-Ubuntu-16.04-xenial\r\nSSL version: OpenSSL 1.0.2g-fips  1 Mar 2016\r\nLinux distro: Ubuntu 16.04 xenial\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/issues/2130/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/issues/2130/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
