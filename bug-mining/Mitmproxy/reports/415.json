This happened when I was testing `modify_body` and `modify_headers` options (see reproduction steps) and it results in repeated error messages with really long tracebacks.\r\n\r\nThe error messages begin by saying that mitmproxy has crashed, but it doesn't actually crash.\r\n\r\n```\r\n[... lots more traceback before the below]\r\n  File \"/home/elespike/venvs/mitmproxy/lib/python3.9/site-packages/mitmproxy/proxy/layer.py\", line 144, inhandle_event\r\n    command = command_generator.send(send)\r\n  File\r\n\"/home/elespike/venvs/mitmproxy/lib/python3.9/site-packages/mitmproxy/proxy/layers/http/__init__.py\", line136, in _handle_event\r\n    yield from self.client_state(event)\r\n  File \"/home/elespike/venvs/mitmproxy/lib/python3.9/site-packages/mitmproxy/proxy/utils.py\", line 23, in\r\n_check_event_type\r\n    raise AssertionError(\r\nAssertionError: Unexpected event type at HttpStream.state_done: Expected no events, got\r\nRequestEndOfMessage(stream_id=1).\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Steps to reproduce the behavior:\r\n1. Start with default options\r\n2. Set `modify_body` and `modify_headers` as follows:\r\n```\r\nmodify_body:\r\n  - :~u webhook.site ~q::<h1>hey</h1>\r\n\r\nmodify_headers:\r\n  - :~u webhook.site ~s:content-type:text/html\r\n```\r\n3.
