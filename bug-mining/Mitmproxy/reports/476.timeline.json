Launch:\r\n  a. `mitmproxy --server-replay my2.flow`.\r\n  b. `mitmweb --server-replay my2.flow`.\r\n4. Modify `server_replay`:\r\n  a. Open Options (Shift-O), scroll to `server_replay`, a) add a new line (`a`) `my1.flow` **or** b) modify the existing line (correct `my2.flow` to `my1.flow`), press `Esc`, `q`, `q`.\r\n  b. Open Options, scroll to `server_replay`, a) add a new line `my1.flow` **or** b) modify the existing line (correct `my2.flow` to `my1.flow`), close Options.\r\n5.

notes that I found while testing this issue:\r\n1. This issue only applies when `server_replay_ignore_params` is set through the UI after startup. It works as intended when the option is set before startup\r\ni.e `mitmproxy --mode reverse:https://test-mitm.free.beeceptor.com --server-replay ~/my.flow --server-replay-reuse --set server_replay_ignore_params=\"param\"` works as intended and ignores param while trying to match requests\r\n2. If we set the option through the UI after startup, setting `server_replay_ignore_param` to `param=value` would match requests when the parameter for the request is `param=value` and return the matching response from the capture but wouldn't match `param=value5` i.e the entire `key=value` is matched when the option is set from the UI\r\n\r\nI'll try to send a fix for

Description\r\nFixes #4506\r\n`mitmproxy` during server-replay mode, calculates the hashes of flows from input files based on user defined filters and uses them to compare against hashes of incoming requests to serve the corresponding stored response by matching the hash. However, during runtime, if the user changes any of the filters, `mitmproxy` fails to recalculate the hashes of input flows and hence doesn't return the intended response. This PR fixes this issue by recomputing the hashes for every flow whenever a filter(option) used for computing hashes is changed.\r\n\r\n#### Checklist\r\n\r\n - [x] I have updated tests where applicable.\r\n - [x] I have added an entry to the CHANGELOG.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/issues/6695/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/issues/6695/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":11956011940,"node_id":"CE_lADOAAfumM4xqo0czwAAAALIokOk","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/issues/events/11956011940","actor":{"login":"mhils","id":1019198,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMTkxOTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1019198?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils","html_url":"https://github.com/mhils","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2024-02-28T18:57:08Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":11956012225,"node_id":"REFE_lADOAAfumM4xqo0czwAAAALIokTB","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/issues/events/11956012225","actor":{"login":"mhils","id":1019198,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMTkxOTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1019198?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils","html_url":"https://github.com/mhils","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"b63a600f840cbaffeff36343d6b1ad303713d06a","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/commits/b63a600f840cbaffeff36343d6b1ad303713d06a","created_at":"2024-02-28T18:57:08Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
