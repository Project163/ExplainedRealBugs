Ignore an host impossible to resolve with your current DNS server\n2. Make a request to this DNS name\n##### What is the expected behavior?\n\nThe request is ignored and not displayed\n##### What went wrong?\n\nThe request is displayed as failed: `Server connection to rx-v579:80 failed: Error connecting to \"rx-v579\": [Errno 8] nodename nor servname provided, or not known`\n##### Any other comments? What have you tried so far?\n\nI have an application on my Android phone making requests to my AVR. Which is not exposed outside of my LAN. When I'm at the office, I have requests to this domain all day long and can't ignore them.\n\nI tried to ignore `rx-v579` and some regex variants, with no luck.\n\n---\n\nMitmproxy Version: 0.17.1\nOperating System: OS X 10.11.4\n\n<!-- Please use the mitmproxy forums (https://discourse.mitmproxy.org/) for support/how-to questions.
