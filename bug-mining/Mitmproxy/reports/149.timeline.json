I' looking at this bug. I guess this is caused by the incompatibility of `--kill` and the `@concurrent` decorator.\n\nWhen the `request` method in the script using `@concurrent` decorator, it will create a new thread and run the following code in it, including kill a flow object. Almost at the same time, the main thread will deal with the response while don't know the flow has been killed by another thread.\n\nIf we remove the `@concurrent` in the script, no errors appear any more.

Steps to reproduce the problem:\n1. Record a website using `mitmdump --anticache -w out.tmp`.\n   \n   For the sake of the example, record the JSON file at http://users-cs.au.dk/cqa/mitmproxy.json.\n2. Replay the website using `mitmdump --anticache -S out.tmp -s proxy.py --no-pop --kill`, where `proxy.py` mutates some responses from the recording.\n   \n   For the sake of the example, use the following `proxy.py` file, that pretty prints JSON files:\n   \n   ```\n   import json\n   \n   from mitmproxy.script import concurrent\n   \n   def prettyjson(input):\n     return json.dumps(json.loads(input), indent=2)\n   \n   @concurrent\n   def request(context, flow):\n     print('start request: %s%s' % (flow.request.host, flow.request.path))\n   \n   def response(context, flow):\n     if not flow.error and flow.request.path.endswith('.json'):\n       flow.response.decode()\n       flow.response.content = prettyjson(flow.response.content)\n     print('finish response: %s%s' % (flow.request.host, flow.request.path))\n   ```\n##### What is the expected behavior?\n\nThe JSON file in the recording gets pretty printed when visiting http://users-cs.au.dk/cqa/mitmproxy.json.\n##### What went wrong?\n\nA crash occurs:\n\n```\nstart request: users-cs.au.dk/cqa/mitmproxy.json\nfinish response: users-cs.au.dk/cqa/mitmproxy.json\n127.0.0.1 GET http://users-cs.au.dk/cqa/mitmproxy.json\n[replay]  << 200 OK 34B\nstart request: users-cs.au.dk/favicon.ico\n127.0.0.1 GET http://users-cs.au.dk/favicon.ico\n << Connection killed\nfinish response: users-cs.au.dk/favicon.ico\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"/home/christofferqa/mitmproxy/venv/bin/mitmdump\", line 9, in <module>\n    load_entry_point('mitmproxy', 'console_scripts', 'mitmdump')()\n  File \"/home/christofferqa/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/main.py\", line 102, in mitmdump\n    master.run()\n  File \"/home/christofferqa/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/dump.py\", line 354, in run\n    return flow.FlowMaster.run(self)\n  File \"/home/christofferqa/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/controller.py\", line 128, in run\n    self.tick(self.masterq, 0.1)\n  File \"/home/christofferqa/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/flow.py\", line 836, in tick\n    return super(FlowMaster, self).tick(q, timeout)\n  File \"/home/christofferqa/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/controller.py\", line 113, in tick\n    self.handle(*msg)\n  File \"/home/christofferqa/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/controller.py\", line 135, in handle\n    m(obj)\n  File \"/home/christofferqa/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/dump.py\", line 337, in handle_response\n    self._process_flow(f)\n  File \"/home/christofferqa/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/dump.py\", line 321, in _process_flow\n    self.state.delete_flow(f)\n  File \"/home/christofferqa/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/flow.py\", line 584, in delete_flow\n    self.flows._remove(f)\n  File \"/home/christofferqa/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/flow.py\", line 496, in _remove\n    self._list.remove(f)\nValueError: list.remove(x): x not in list\n```\n##### Any other comments?\n\nThe bug only manifests when using `@concurrent` and `--kill` at the same time, and therefore may be related to #1061.\n\n---\n\nMitmproxy Version: [master](https://github.com/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/tree/96782407833a7f827e79fa7aa5f2576f1bee3547) (0.18)\nOperating System: Ubuntu 14.03.3\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/issues/1082/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/issues/1082/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
