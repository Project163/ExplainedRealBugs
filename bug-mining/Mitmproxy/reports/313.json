Open `mitmproxy`\r\n2.  set a value for `view_filter` in Options or using the ` : set view_filter={str} `\r\n3. Open a attached browser and open any url\r\n4. Quit the browser and Open the Eventlog in mitmproxy. \r\n\r\n\r\n##### Any other comments? What have you tried so far?\r\nAnother error occuring for the view_filter option. I was working on a fix for #2801 #2951 when i noticed this other error occurs if any value is setup in view_filter. I think it requires a complete patch once and for all. \r\n\r\n##### System information\r\nMitmproxy: 4.0.0.dev103 (commit 77ed33b) \r\nPython:    3.6.4\r\nOpenSSL:   OpenSSL 1.1.0g  2 Nov 2017\r\nPlatform:  Linux-4.14.21-1-MANJARO-x86_64-with-arch-Manjaro-Linux\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"mhils","id":1019198,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMTkxOTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1019198?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils","html_url":"https://github.com/mhils","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/issues/2969/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/issues/2969/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
