I'm sorry that this breaks people's setups during upgrade, but we can't keep the default configuration without a password in the light of this finding. Allowlisting localhost - which is kind of how it worked before - can be circumvented.\n\nI'm not opposed to adding an option that disables authentication if we have a good use case for it that cannot be satisfied by adding `?token=password` to the URL. Apart from that, I will take the feedback here to add a better logging message that points to setting `web_password`
