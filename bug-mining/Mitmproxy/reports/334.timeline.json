@Jazzelhawk! It looks like IPv6 is the culprit here, which now works in mitmproxy but is not supported by our Windows resolver yet:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/blob/76c056affdad6a8f57a523534c56a50524c8f7e9/mitmproxy/platform/windows.py#L152-L158\r\n\r\nI started working on IPv6 support (https://github.com/mhils/mitmproxy/tree/windows-ipv6), but it's a bit tricky and will need a few days. One workaround for now might be binding the proxy to 127.0.0.1 in order to force IPv4.
