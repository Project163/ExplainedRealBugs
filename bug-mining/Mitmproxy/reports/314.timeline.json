think the most useful one is [syntax for variable annotations](https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/3.6.html#whatsnew36-pep526), which would be very nice for e.g. stateobject and generally type annotations in the codebase. Second, the [formatted string literals](https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/3.6.html#whatsnew36-pep498) are considerably nicer than `\"\" % ()` or `\"\".format()`.
