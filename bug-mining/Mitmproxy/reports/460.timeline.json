seemed like an issue in tornado, I am not yet exactly sure why this works but if I comment out the lines in tornado's `netutils.py` setting `socket.SO_REUSEADDR` then it works as expected on macOS too. These are the lines:\r\n\r\n- [netutil.py#L135](https://github.com/tornadoweb/tornado/blob/59536016e37704a1c47a3a0d262f46ceb6132c06/tornado/netutil.py#L135)\r\n- [netutil.py#L141](https://github.com/tornadoweb/tornado/blob/59536016e37704a1c47a3a0d262f46ceb6132c06/tornado/netutil.py#L141)\r\n\r\n\r\nThis could be due to the fact that the proxy binds to all local addresses whereas the web page only binds to 127.0.0.1 and through whatever magic SO_REUSEADDR does, this might be allowing the web page to bind to port 8081 even when the proxy is already bound to that port.
