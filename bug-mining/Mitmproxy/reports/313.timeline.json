I have an assumption concerning this issue. I am not sure it is absolutely correct.\r\nAs you can see the issue appears when mitmproxy tries to give us a representation of `ServerConnection` object, when `ValueError` is raised inside https://github.com/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/blob/master/mitmproxy/addons/view.py#L521\r\n\r\nFor some reasons for some flows `self.address` is still `None`, when we need it to be available in `ServerConnection`. When we write `time.sleep(1)`, we suspend execution of the calling thread for 1 second. **Perhaps** mitmproxy switches to other available thread and this thread set the value for `self.address`. The problem is that suspended thread is `MainThread` and every new case with `self.address is None` almost all mitmproxy functions will stop for 1 second.\r\nIt is also possible, that for some reasons mitmproxy gets `self.address` with a delay and when we write `time.sleep(1)` we compensate this delay. \r\n\r\nbtw `time.sleep(0.1)` works as well.\r\n","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/issues/comments/374128191/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"kajojify","id":20267977,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwMjY3OTc3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20267977?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kajojify","html_url":"https://github.com/kajojify","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kajojify/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kajojify/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kajojify/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kajojify/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kajojify/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kajojify/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kajojify/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kajojify/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kajojify/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":1527873088,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MTUyNzg3MzA4OA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/issues/events/1527873088","actor":{"login":"fenilgandhi","id":9128903,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkxMjg5MDM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9128903?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fenilgandhi","html_url":"https://github.com/fenilgandhi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fenilgandhi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fenilgandhi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fenilgandhi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fenilgandhi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fenilgandhi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fenilgandhi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fenilgandhi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fenilgandhi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fenilgandhi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-03-19T07:57:38Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":1527873089,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDE1Mjc4NzMwODk=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/issues/events/1527873089","actor":{"login":"fenilgandhi","id":9128903,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkxMjg5MDM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9128903?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fenilgandhi","html_url":"https://github.com/fenilgandhi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fenilgandhi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fenilgandhi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fenilgandhi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fenilgandhi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fenilgandhi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fenilgandhi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fenilgandhi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fenilgandhi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fenilgandhi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-03-19T07:57:38Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/issues/comments/374160155","html_url":"https://github.com/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/issues/2969#issuecomment-374160155","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/issues/2969","id":374160155,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM3NDE2MDE1NQ==","user":{"login":"fenilgandhi","id":9128903,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkxMjg5MDM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9128903?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fenilgandhi","html_url":"https://github.com/fenilgandhi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fenilgandhi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fenilgandhi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fenilgandhi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fenilgandhi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fenilgandhi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fenilgandhi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fenilgandhi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fenilgandhi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fenilgandhi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_typ
