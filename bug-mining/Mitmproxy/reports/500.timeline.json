Description\r\n\r\nThere has been a long standing issue #3140 so I tested out the code on the latest commit and it seems to still work :) so I figured I would try to get it merged\r\n\r\nHere is a more detailed description from https://github.com/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/commit/0a095b28cd15abe3bbc2da25563bc7899a6b3309\r\n> Properly integrate CRLs into the TLS flow\r\nWhen establishing a connection the CRL distribution points are\r\nextracted from the upstream cert. They are passed to the dummy\r\ncertificate creation function and their original path is replaced\r\nwith the CA's serial number. This makes it possible to detect the\r\nmodified URL without having to store any additional per-URL state.\r\n>\r\n> The certificate store has been extended to generate an empty CRL\r\nat initialization. The tlsconfig addon has been extended to detect\r\na modified CRL URL and serve the empty CRL from the certificate\r\nstore.\r\n\r\n#### Checklist\r\n\r\n - [X] I have updated tests where applicable.\r\n - [X] I have added an entry to the CHANGELOG.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/issues/7609/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/issues/7609/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/issues/comments/2742799388","html_url":"https://github.com/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/issues/7614#issuecomment-2742799388","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/issues/7614","id":2742799388,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAAfumM6je8wc","user":{"login":"JordanPlayz158","id":22566618,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNTY2NjE4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22566618?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JordanPlayz158","html_url":"https://github.com/JordanPlayz158","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JordanPlayz158/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JordanPlayz158/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JordanPlayz158/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JordanPlayz158/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JordanPlayz158/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JordanPlayz158/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JordanPlayz158/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JordanPlayz158/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JordanPlayz158/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-03-21T09:27:14Z","updated_at":"2025-03-21T09:27:14Z","body":"Want to note that it also happened on my system and I run linux so likely not OS specific (in case it could be implied to be OS specific with the `on Windows` wording)","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/issues/comments/2742799388/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"JordanPlayz158","id":22566618,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNTY2NjE4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22566618?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JordanPlayz158","html_url":"https://github.com/JordanPlayz158","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JordanPlayz158/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JordanPlayz158/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JordanPlayz158/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JordanPlayz158/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JordanPlayz158/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JordanPlayz158/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JordanPlayz158/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JordanPlayz158/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JordanPlayz158/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/issues/comments/2742823239","html_url":"https://github.com/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/issues/7614#issuecomment-2742823239","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/issues/7614","id":2742823239,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAAfumM6jfClH","user":{"login":"mhils","id":1019198,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMTkxOTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1019198?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils","html_url":"https://github.com/mhils","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-03-21T09:36:54Z","updated_at":"2025-03-21T09:36:54Z","body":"Oh, interesting.
