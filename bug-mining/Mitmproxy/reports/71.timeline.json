To be on the safe side, we therefore don't redirect non-HTTP traffic by default.\n\nHowever, there are going to be some workarounds:\n1. The master version already covers a `--ignore` switch, which tells mitmproxy to ignore a whole domain. You can already use that if that fits your use-case.\n2. We probably want something similar for `Connection: Upgrade` and wss:// connections, but we haven't decided on anything specific yet. Probably some kind of `--tcp` switch, but let's see how we do that best.\n3. This can of course already be scripted, but it's not particularly obvious how to do that. If you're interested, I can happily provide a basic sample script.\n\nCheers,\nMax\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/issues/comments/53970086/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"mhils","id":1019198,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMTkxOTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1019198?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils","html_url":"https://github.com/mhils","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/issues/comments/65008014","html_url":"https://github.com/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/issues/340#issuecomment-65008014","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/issues/340","id":65008014,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY1MDA4MDE0","user":{"login":"bradleypeabody","id":3239710,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyMzk3MTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3239710?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bradleypeabody","html_url":"https://github.com/bradleypeabody","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bradleypeabody/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bradleypeabody/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bradleypeabody/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bradleypeabody/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bradleypeabody/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bradleypeabody/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bradleypeabody/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bradleypeabody/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bradleypeabody/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-12-01T00:36:37Z","updated_at":"2014-12-01T00:36:37Z","body":"Hi Max,\n\nThis is also something I'd be interesting in seeing.  In my case having it scripted is no problem at all.  If you could provide an example that would be awesome and would make it so those of us trying to allow websockets to function (even if not logged) have a workable way to do this.  I could take a stab at this myself but if you already know how to do this and could provide the example that would be very helpful.\n\nBest,
