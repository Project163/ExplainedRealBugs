Run `mitmproxy` and start intercepting flows.\r\n\r\n2. Let the UI fill with flows and then goto the last flow.\r\n\r\n![m1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/20314742/32436238-62843d80-c309-11e7-9c28-df97ff8b4688.png)\r\n\r\n3. Press up key to go one flow above.\r\n\r\n4. The UI shifts one flow downwards instead of marker going one flow upwards.\r\n\r\n![m2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/20314742/32436228-5d7a0df6-c309-11e7-85ca-16f5438d6adf.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n##### Any other comments? What have you tried so far?\r\n\r\nThis is not a deal breaker or anything but a bit annoying. This seems to happen only with the last flow in UI.\r\n\r\n##### System information\r\n\r\n<!-- Paste the output of \"mitmproxy --version\" here. -->\r\n\r\n```\r\nMitmproxy: 3.0.0 \r\nPython:    3.6.2\r\nOpenSSL:   OpenSSL 1.0.2g  1 Mar 2016\r\nPlatform:  Linux-4.8.0-53-generic-x86_64-with-debian-stretch-sid\r\n```\r\n\r\n<!-- Please use the mitmproxy forums (https://discourse.mitmproxy.org/) for support/how-to questions.
