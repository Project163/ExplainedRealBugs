Thanks for pointing this out - there's definitely a performance issue here. There is certainly no intrinsic limit at play - this is just an issue (arguably a bug) we need to track down and fix. \n\nThe problem seems to affect mitmproxy console specifically. Using mitmdump performance is good - here's a run with a modified version of your script comparing mitmdump with no proxy at all:\n\n```\nStarting mitmdump: 2014-10-21 10:44:58 +1300\nEnding mitmdump: 14.321507\nStarting no proxy: 2014-10-21 10:45:13 +1300\nEnding no proxy: 12.394307\n```\n\nWe have a new release scheduled for the next few days - if this is an obvious issue, I'l have it fixed by then. If not, please keep an eye out for a patch release soon after.\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/issues/comments/59845768/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"cortesi","id":22544,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNTQ0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22544?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cortesi","html_url":"https://github.com/cortesi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cortesi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cortesi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cortesi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cortesi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cortesi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cortesi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cortesi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cortesi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cortesi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":181190659,"node_id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDE4MTE5MDY1OQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/issues/events/181190659","actor":{"login":"mhils","id":1019198,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMTkxOTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1019198?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils","html_url":"https://github.com/mhils","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2014-10-20T21:58:31Z","label":{"name":"bug","color":"f7c6c7"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":181190665,"node_id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDE4MTE5MDY2NQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/issues/events/181190665","actor":{"login":"mhils","id":1019198,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMTkxOTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1019198?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils","html_url":"https://github.com/mhils","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2014-10-20T21:58:32Z","label":{"name":"0.10","color":"fbca04"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":181190667,"node_id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDE4MTE5MDY2Nw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/issues/events/181190667","actor":{"login":"mhils","id":1019198,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMTkxOTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1019198?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils","html_url":"https://github.com/mhils","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2014-10-20T21:58:34Z","label":{"name":"0.11","color":"fbca04"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":181190669,"node_id":"MDE0OlVubGFiZWxlZEV2ZW50MTgxMTkwNjY5","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/issues/events/181190669","ac
