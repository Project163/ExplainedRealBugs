should provide better guidance on the various ways to setup transparent proxying. Most notably, we should make the distinction between\n\n<pre>internet &lt;---> proxy &lt;---> proxied network</pre>\n\nand\n\n<pre>internet &lt;---&gt; proxy  \n           |\n           V\n    proxied device \n(proxy as custom gateway)</pre>\n\nclear. The latter is simpler to set up but - allowing to bypass the proxy - obviously dangerous in some contexts. When we're at it, we should add a prominent warning that Linux sends ICMP redirects by default if the machines are on the same network.\n","closed_by":{"login":"mhils","id":1019198,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMTkxOTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1019198?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils","html_url":"https://github.com/mhils","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/issues/255/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/issues/255/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
