The CHANGELOG for mitmproxy 10 claims that the only breaking change for addons are `connection.Client/Server` constructor. However, `Cert.altnames` has also changed. I assume this was inherited from an upgrade to `cryptography`? \r\n\r\nIt would be easy for me to update the CHANGELOG, but this is a general problem how we can avoid breaking addons in the future when inheriting changes from other libraries.\r\n\r\n#### Steps to reproduce the behavior:\r\n\r\naddon.py\r\n\r\n```py\r\ndef tls_established_server(data):\r\n    server = data.conn\r\n\r\n    for cert in server.certificate_list:\r\n        for name in cert.altnames:\r\n            print(name)\r\n```\r\n\r\n1.  `mitmdump --scripts addon.py`\r\n2.  `curl --insecure --proxy localhost:8080 https://example.com/`\r\n\r\n# Mitmproxy 9 output\r\n\r\n```\r\nwww.example.org\r\nexample.net\r\nexample.edu\r\nexample.com\r\nexample.org\r\nwww.example.com\r\nwww.example.edu\r\nwww.example.net\r\n```\r\n\r\n# Mitmproxy 10 output\r\n\r\n```\r\n<DNSName(value='www.example.org')>\r\n<DNSName(value='example.net')>\r\n<DNSName(value='example.edu')>\r\n<DNSName(value='example.com')>\r\n<DNSName(value='example.org')>\r\n<DNSName(value='www.example.com')>\r\n<DNSName(value='www.example.edu')>\r\n<DNSName(value='www.example.net')>\r\n```","closed_by":{"login":"mhils","id":1019198,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMTkxOTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1019198?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils","html_url":"https://github.com/mhils","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/issues/6750/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/issues/6750/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
