from the first point of Features section of the readme:\n\n> If a value is specified in more than one way then: command line > environment variables > config file values > defaults.\n\nConfigArgParse (CAP) overrides the values specified in the config file with those specified in the command line arguments. For most of the cases this behaviour is nice, except when it isn't.\n\nConsider the case of a [mitmproxy user](https://github.com/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/issues/953) who has specified some scripts in the config file, and when they specify another script in the command line, the config ones get replaced.\n\nThe expected behaviour here is the merging of the list of scripts. \n\nI propose that CAP should add a new parameter (say `multiple`) to `parser.add_argument` that determines this override behaviour. So, for eg, the following snippet would result in an option that merges the values:\n\n``` python\nparser.add_argument(\n    \"-s\", \"--script\", \n    action=\"append\", type=str, dest=\"scripts\" default=[],\n    multiple=\"merge\"\n)\n```\n\nThe `multiple` parameter could have values: \n- `merge` - Merge the values specified in the command line, env variables & config files & defaults.\n- `override` - Follow the normal override process we follow now.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bw2/ConfigArgParse/issues/50/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bw2/ConfigArgParse/issues/50/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/issues/comments/186603525","html_url":"https://github.com/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/issues/953#issuecomment-186603525","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/issues/953","id":186603525,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE4NjYwMzUyNQ==","user":{"login":"dufferzafar","id":1449512,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0NDk1MTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1449512?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dufferzafar","html_url":"https://github.com/dufferzafar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dufferzafar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dufferzafar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dufferzafar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dufferzafar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dufferzafar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dufferzafar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dufferzafar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dufferzafar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dufferzafar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-02-20T13:54:20Z","updated_at":"2016-02-20T13:54:42Z","body":"I feel this is a legitimate feature request for mitm and have created an upstream issue over at ConfigArgParse.

PR does the following:\r\n\r\n- Adds YAML serialization for options, including the ability to rewrite an options file in-place, retaining user comments and formating.\r\n- Ditches configargparse in favor of argparse\r\n- Converts all command-line tools to use a single config file, which is ~/.mitmproxy/config.yaml by default. \r\n- Amalgamates all the Options classes into one to support a common config file. Having separate files was too awkward. \r\n- All defaults are now managed in the Options specification rather than being split between options and the command-line parsing functionality. \r\n\r\nLoose ends:\r\n\r\n- We lose the ability to set options as environment variables. I think this is rarely used, but we can add it back trivially if we switch to click down the track.\r\n- The *keep_serving* argument used to have a different default in console/web and mitmdump - it's now true by default for all tools. We should re-think this option in a future patch. \r\n\r\nFuture work:\r\n\r\n- Add config saving to mitmproxy console\r\n- Add a utility method to Options that reads info from parsed arguments and updates the existing config. This would differ from the .update() method in that it would extend sequence types rather than over-writing it to address #953\r\n- Rationalise all the option names. We have a lot of ambiguity, and some overlap between the tools at the moment.
