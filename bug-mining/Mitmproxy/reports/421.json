I get it both on an iPad with Safari and a Fedora with Firefox. It especially happens with pass-through connections but also without.\r\n\r\nI think I have tracked down the bug to _mitmproxy/proxy/server.py_ where in ConnectionHandler.handle_connection() there is the following loop:\r\n\r\n```\r\n        while True:\r\n            try:\r\n                data = await reader.read(65535)\r\n                if not data:\r\n                    raise OSError(\"Connection closed by peer.\")\r\n            except OSError:\r\n                break\r\n            except asyncio.CancelledError as e:\r\n                cancelled = e\r\n                break\r\n            else:\r\n                self.server_event(events.DataReceived(connection, data))\r\n                for transport in self.transports.values():\r\n                    if transport.writer is not None:\r\n                        await transport.writer.drain()\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe final drain() can actually throw and if it does all the connection management following the loop is not properly done, leaving the connection in a strange state. My suggested fix that made it work without further hick-ups for me is this:\r\n\r\n```\r\n        reader = self.transports[connection].reader\r\n        writer = self.transports[connection].writer\r\n        assert reader\r\n        assert writer\r\n        while True:\r\n...\r\n            else:\r\n                self.server_event(events.DataReceived(connection, data))\r\n                for transport in self.transports.values():\r\n                    if transport.writer is not None:\r\n                        try:\r\n                            await transport.writer.drain()\r\n                        except OSError as e:\r\n                            if transport.writer == writer:\r\n                                cancelled = e\r\n                                break\r\n                else:\r\n                    continue\r\n                break\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Steps to reproduce the behavior:\r\n1. Start mitmdump as transparent proxy with '--ignore-hosts .com'\r\n2. Go to apple.com\r\n3. Quickly click on links, attempt to abort a page load with a re-load of the same page\r\n\r\n#### System Information\r\nMitmproxy: 8.0.0.dev (+200, commit ef8c88d)\r\nPython:    3.9.7\r\nOpenSSL:   OpenSSL 1.1.1m  14 Dec 2021\r\nPlatform:  Linux-4.18.0-348.2.1.el8_5.x86_64-x86_64-with-glibc2.28\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"mhils","id":1019198,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMTkxOTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1019198?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils","html_url":"https://github.com/mhils","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/issues/5034/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/issues/5034/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
