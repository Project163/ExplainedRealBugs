Run `dig +short google.com`\r\n2. Correct output: `142.250.193.206`\r\n\r\n##### With mitmproxy\r\n\r\n1. Start mitmproxy `mitmproxy --mode dns@53535`\r\n2. Run `dig @127.0.0.1 -p 53535 +short google.com`\r\n3. Output with duplicates:\r\n    ```\r\n    142.250.193.206\r\n    142.250.193.206\r\n    142.250.193.206\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n#### System Information\r\n\r\n```\r\nMitmproxy: 11.0.0.dev (+19, commit d638213)\r\nPython:    3.12.1\r\nOpenSSL:   OpenSSL 3.1.4 24 Oct 2023\r\nPlatform:  Linux-6.6.14-200.fc39.x86_64-x86_64-with-glibc2.38\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Additional Notes\r\n\r\nThis is happening because the `dns_resolver` addon calls `getaddrinfo` here:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/blob/1a02ebb89f6765d827f2fe0086dfe5960eb6e093/mitmproxy/addons/dns_resolver.py#L29\r\n\r\nWhich is returning one tuple each for UDP, TCP and a raw socket.\r\n\r\nWe could just do the following since I assume all requests are currently using UDP:\r\n```python\r\naddrinfos = await loop.getaddrinfo(host=question.name, port=0, family=family, type=socket.SOCK_DGRAM)\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhat do you think?","closed_by":{"login":"meitinger","id":3720329,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3MjAzMjk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3720329?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/meitinger","html_url":"https://github.com/meitinger","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/meitinger/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/meitinger/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/meitinger/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/meitinger/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/meitinger/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/meitinger/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/meitinger/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/meitinger/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/meitinger/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/issues/6647/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/issues/6647/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
