@cortesi: What's the purpose of `netlib.utils.cleanBin`, called by `ViewRaw`? I'm no console expert, so what is meant by `to make it safe to display` ?\n\nHello. I hope you don't mind me butting in here.\n\nI looked at the source. \"safe to display\" in this case means replacing anything that isn't a valid printable ASCII character with a '.'.\n\nIn other words, the program is assuming that the console can only display 7 bit ASCII characters, (and TAB and NEWLINE if 'fixspacing' is true.) and anything else (e.g. UTF-8) is undisplayable binary 'junk', and is therefore filtered.\n\nThis is the correct filter for ASCII.\n\nUTF-8 is a super-set of ASCII (as are most encoding types) so filtering everything to ASCII is a suitable 'lowest common denominator that will display everywhere (but without the extended characters being available!)\n\nTo reliably support other character sets, you should use a filter appropriate to 'charset' returned in the 'Content-Type:\" header - with the additional caveat that the users terminal is set to handle that character set.\n\nYou 'need' (i.e. 'should have') a server-side filter to ensure that data that is illegal in the required character set is stripped (just as the 'cleanBin' function mentions above does for ASCII)\n\nThe more complete way to do this would be to use the iconv library, which can filter many character sets and even convert them automatically to the users local set.\n\nJust feed it the remote document with the input charset (extracted from the \"Content-type:\") and the users local charset (determined from the users environment) - setting iconv to strip / replace invalid data rather than abort with a translating error.\n\nThis will then automatically convert (and sanatize) the input charset to the users required charset.\n\nThe 'quick fix' aluded to here (i.e. disable the 'cleanBin' filter) basically assumes that both the users charset is the same (or a superset) of the documents charset, and that the document contains no invalid encoding data.\n\nIt would sorta work most of the time, if a users terminal is set to UTF-8, and the remote document is ASCII or UTF-8, AND (a big one) the remote document character encoding is valid.\n\nBut it's really an unreliable hack..... There's a reason 'cleanBin' exists in the first place :-)\n\nN.B. I've never used the python iconv bindings, so can't comment on them specifically.\n\nhttps://www.gnu.org/software/libiconv/\n\nhttps://pypi.python.org/pypi/iconv/1.0\n\nCheers,\n

Yes, it seems once you've sorted out what comes from the server, urwid will deal with the client-side (which is often the more trickier to diagnose, because users don't always have their setup configured properly, use all sorts of different console emulators, on all sorts of different platforms, and generally neglect to mention something important when complaining!)\n\nI can understand how it's not a critical enhancement.....
