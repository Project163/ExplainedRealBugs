I found this fix for the issue in one project:\r\nhttps://github.com/ska-sa/aiokatcp/commit/200189687148ab63b79081d8cfd6c2c92277895c\r\nI did a small modification to `mitmproxy/proxy/server.py` to see if this approach would be viable:\r\n```\r\n                 elif isinstance(command, commands.SendData):\r\n                     writer = self.transports[command.connection].writer\r\n                     assert writer\r\n+                    if writer.transport.is_closing():\r\n+                        self.log(f\"XXX Write to closed connection {command.connection}\")\r\n                     writer.write(command.data)\r\n                 elif isinstance(command, commands.CloseConnection):\r\n                     self.close_connection(command.connection, command.half_close)\r\n...\r\n             try:\r\n                 writer = self.transports[connection].writer\r\n                 assert writer\r\n+                if writer.transport.is_closing():\r\n+                    self.log(f\"XXX Eof for closed connection {connection}\")\r\n                 writer.write_eof()\r\n             except OSError:\r\n```\r\nI did get the above log entry for `writer.write` pretty quickly.

Add the check you suggested. That seems reasonable to me.\r\n2. Check if the connection state is still open when receiving a wakeup, and only then sending a ping. This seems equally reasonable, maybe even more clean.\r\n3. Add a new `CancelWakeup` command to cancel the wakup requests when receiving a ConnectionClosed.

This is probably also the reason why few other will see the original error message. I have quite a list of hosts and domains for which I just want pass-through, because I don't care (ads, tracking) or because of certificate pinning or TLS fingerprinting. Anybody who wants to reproduce the error may want to do so with a script like this:\r\n```\r\ndef tls_clienthello(data: tls.ClientHelloData):\r\n    data.ignore_connection = True\r\n```\r\nSo given that no higher protocol is involved it may be the best to just add the checks in the two locations in `server.py`, optionally only if the connection is pass-through, but I think adding it for all cases is safer. What I am not sure is that if `is_closing()` is true then the proxy is guaranteed to otherwise notice the closed connection and terminate the flow and both ends. It looks to me that way and just not doing the `write()` or `write_eol()` should be enough.\r\nI didn't find any other occurrences of `write()` or `write_eol()` but maybe I wasn't thorough enough.","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/issues/comments/1138450353/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"EndUser509","id":42170559,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyMTcwNTU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/42170559?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/EndUser509","html_url":"https://github.com/EndUser509","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EndUser509/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EndUser509/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EndUser509/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EndUser509/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EndUser509/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EndUser509/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EndUser509/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EndUser509/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EndUser509/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/issues/comments/1138460527","html_url":"https://github.com/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/issues/5363#issuecomment-1138460527","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/issues/5363","id":1138460527,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAAfumM5D24dv","user":{"login":"EndUser509","id":42170559,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyMTcwNTU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/42170559?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/EndUser509","html_url":"https://github.com/EndUser509","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EndUser509/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EndUser509/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EndUser509/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EndUser509/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EndUser509/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EndUser509/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EndUser509/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EndUser509/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EndUser509/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-05-26T11:54:02Z","updated_at":"2022-05-26T11:54:02Z","body":"Followup:
