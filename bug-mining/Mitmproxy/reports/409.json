Run mitmpoxy in upstream mode (e.g. route traffic through tinyproxy server)\r\n2. Execute any request\r\n3. Replay this request\r\n4. The replay fails as it is executed with a preceding CONNECT request\r\n\r\n#### System Information\r\nMitmproxy: 8.0.0.dev (+148, commit 79f464b)\r\nPython:    3.8.10\r\nOpenSSL:   OpenSSL 1.1.1l  24 Aug 2021\r\nPlatform:  Linux-5.11.0-38-generic-x86_64-with-glibc2.29\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"mhils","id":1019198,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMTkxOTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1019198?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils","html_url":"https://github.com/mhils","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/issues/4876/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/issues/4876/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
