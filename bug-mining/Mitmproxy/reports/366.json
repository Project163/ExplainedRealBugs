Capture a request \r\n2. Press v in the flow view of request and 2 for viewing response\r\n3. Firefox opens up to view the response html page but only displays file not found e.g. `Firefox can’t find the file at /tmp/mproxynqb8uytn.html`. (Hitting `e` and editing the response works correctly and opens up the response as a tmp file in my editor)\r\n\r\n#### System Information\r\nMitmproxy: 5.1.1\r\nPython:    3.8.3\r\nOpenSSL:   OpenSSL 1.1.1g  21 Apr 2020\r\nPlatform:  Linux-5.6.19-2-MANJARO-x86_64-with-glibc2.2.5\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"mhils","id":1019198,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMTkxOTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1019198?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils","html_url":"https://github.com/mhils","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/issues/4152/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/issues/4152/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
