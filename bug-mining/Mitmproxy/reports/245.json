Go to http://www.html-kit.com/tools/cookietester/\r\n2. Click 'Set Test Cookie'\r\n3. Observe that one cookie is sent to the server.\r\n4. Remove the cookie.\r\n5. launch mitmproxy with `mitmproxy -t html-kit\\.com` and tell your browser to use it as a proxy\r\n6. Reload the page.\r\n7. Click 'Set Test Cookie'\r\n8. Observe that two 'cookies' are sent to the server.\r\n\r\n##### Any other comments? What have you tried so far?\r\nThere appears to be a comma in the output of mitmproxy, even though it is surrounded by quotes. It's possible, then that this is a parsing fail on the tool's end caused by a difference in what's sent back for the format of the date. Still, should it really be changing that?\r\n\r\n##### System information\r\nArch Linux, freshly updated.\r\n\r\nMitmproxy version: 2.0.1 (release version) \r\nPython version: 3.6.0\r\nPlatform: Linux-4.10.6-1-ARCH-x86_64-with-glibc2.3.4\r\nSSL version: OpenSSL 1.0.2k  26 Jan 2017\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"mhils","id":1019198,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMTkxOTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1019198?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils","html_url":"https://github.com/mhils","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/issues/2228/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/issues/2228/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
