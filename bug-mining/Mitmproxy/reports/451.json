But if you run the image directly it repros. Also repros on my Ubuntu by simply deleting `.mitmproxy` (or I renamed it to `._mitmproxy` for a quick test).\r\n\r\n1. `docker run --rm -it mitmproxy/mitmproxy:9.0.1 bash`\r\n2. `mitmdump --mode wireguard`\r\n\r\n```\r\n[16:38:27.663] WireGuard server failed to listen on *:51820 with [Errno 2] No such file or directory: '/root/.mitmproxy/wireguard.conf'\r\n```\r\n\r\nRunning `mitmdump` once, closing it, and then running `mitmdump --mode wireguard` works.","closed_by":{"login":"mhils","id":1019198,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMTkxOTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1019198?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils","html_url":"https://github.com/mhils","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/issues/5715/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/issues/5715/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
