It does work but mitmproxy spits out a stack trace when it encounters a reference to an instance of `zerorpc.Client` anywhere.\r\n\r\n#### Steps to reproduce the behavior:\r\n1. `pipx inject mitmproxy zerorpc`\r\n2. `mitmdump --scripts addon.py`\r\n\r\n```python\r\nimport zerorpc\r\n\r\nclass MyAddon:\r\n  def __init__(self):\r\n    self.rpc = zerorpc.Client()\r\n\r\naddons = [\r\n  MyAddon()\r\n]\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\nAddon error: Traceback (most recent call last):\r\n  File \"/home/alex/.local/pipx/venvs/mitmproxy/lib/python3.7/site-packages/mitmproxy/addonmanager.py\", line 42, in safecall\r\n    yield\r\n  File \"/home/alex/.local/pipx/venvs/mitmproxy/lib/python3.7/site-packages/mitmproxy/addons/script.py\", line 102, in loadscript\r\n    ctx.master.addons.register(ns)\r\n  File \"/home/alex/.local/pipx/venvs/mitmproxy/lib/python3.7/site-packages/mitmproxy/addonmanager.py\", line 161, in register\r\n    self.master.commands.collect_commands(a)\r\n  File \"/home/alex/.local/pipx/venvs/mitmproxy/lib/python3.7/site-packages/mitmproxy/command.py\", line 158, in collect_commands\r\n    self.add(o.command_name, o)\r\n  File \"/home/alex/.local/pipx/venvs/mitmproxy/lib/python3.7/site-packages/mitmproxy/command.py\", line 165, in add\r\n    self.commands[path] = Command(self, path, func)\r\n  File \"/home/alex/.local/pipx/venvs/mitmproxy/lib/python3.7/site-packages/mitmproxy/command.py\", line 64, in __init__\r\n    self.signature = inspect.signature(self.func)\r\n  File \"/usr/lib/python3.7/inspect.py\", line 3083, in signature\r\n    return Signature.from_callable(obj, follow_wrapped=follow_wrapped)\r\n  File \"/usr/lib/python3.7/inspect.py\", line 2833, in from_callable\r\n    follow_wrapper_chains=follow_wrapped)\r\n  File \"/usr/lib/python3.7/inspect.py\", line 2246, in _signature_from_callable\r\n    'attribute'.format(sig))\r\nTypeError: unexpected object <function ClientBase.__getattr__.<locals>.<lambda> at 0x7f66616d0b00> in __signature__ attribute\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nthe absolute minimal example is this, which does not error when run directly outside of mitmproxy but does when used as an addon\r\n\r\n```python\r\nimport zerorpc\r\nc = zerorpc.Client()\r\n```\r\n\r\nI don't know enough Python to understand the underlying issue. I assume there is nothing wrong with zerorpc but with the assumptions mitmproxy makes about stuff that addons expose?\r\n\r\n\r\n#### System Information\r\n\r\n```\r\nMitmproxy: 5.0.1\r\nPython:    3.7.5\r\nOpenSSL:   OpenSSL 1.1.0j  20 Nov 2018\r\nPlatform:  Linux-5.3.0-26-generic-x86_64-with-Ubuntu-19.10-eoan\r\n```\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"mhils","id":1019198,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMTkxOTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1019198?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils","html_url":"https://github.com/mhils","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/issues/3794/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/issues/3794/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
