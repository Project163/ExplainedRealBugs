If I invoke `mitmproxy` with any scripts on the command line then all the scripts I defined in my config file are overridden and only the scripts on the command line are used.\n\nIs this the intended behavior? If it is, would it be possible to add a new flag for scripts that are not intended to be overridden by scripts passed on the command line?\n","closed_by":{"login":"cortesi","id":22544,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNTQ0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22544?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cortesi","html_url":"https://github.com/cortesi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cortesi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cortesi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cortesi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cortesi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cortesi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cortesi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cortesi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cortesi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cortesi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/issues/953/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/issues/953/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
