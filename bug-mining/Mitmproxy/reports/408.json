[It includes a bug that causes it to incorrectly fail to validate TLS certificates](https://community.letsencrypt.org/t/openssl-client-compatibility-changes-for-let-s-encrypt-certificates/143816) (that link notes that GnuTLS < 3.6.14 26 is affected; [the version in Debian Buster](https://packages.debian.org/buster/libgnutls30) is 3.6.7) where the root has an expired cross-sign, [which is now the case for Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/docs/dst-root-ca-x3-expiration-september-2021/). `apt` when talking HTTPS uses GnuTLS, so `apt-get install` against an HTTPS source (which is not normal, normally, `apt` does not use encryption when fetching packages; however, security requirements in my industry requires that we vendor packages & use TLS to prevent, e.g., supply-chain attacks; thus, we end up fetching over HTTPS) fails in Buster. We use `mitmproxy`, but also need `nc`. It used to be installed by default, back when things were based on Alpine, but that's no longer the case. We also think that the absolutely ancient version of `mitmproxy` we're using is affected by a similar bug, as it is failing to validate a cert that is actually valid, and the failures started at the time of the cross-signing cert's expiry. But we'd like to upgrade to the newer version, of course, first. But the lack of `nc` in the base image means it doesn't work as a drop in replacement, and the base image of Buster means it can't be installed.","closed_by":{"login":"Kriechi","id":114300,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNDMwMA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/114300?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kriechi","html_url":"https://github.com/Kriechi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kriechi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kriechi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kriechi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kriechi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kriechi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kriechi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kriechi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kriechi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kriechi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/issues/4846/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/issues/4846/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
