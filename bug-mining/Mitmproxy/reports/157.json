Visiting the website with Chrome does not segfault Chrome, but instead continues as if the cookiename is valid. I believe mitmdump should handle this error gracefully instead of crashing.\n\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"/usr/local/bin/mitmdump\", line 9, in <module>\n    load_entry_point('mitmproxy==0.18', 'console_scripts', 'mitmdump')()\n  File \"/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/mitmproxy/main.py\", line 102, in mitmdump\n    master.run()\n  File \"/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/mitmproxy/dump.py\", line 350, in run\n    super(DumpMaster, self).run()\n  File \"/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/mitmproxy/controller.py\", line 27, in run\n    self.tick(0.1)\n  File \"/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/mitmproxy/flow.py\", line 845, in tick\n    return super(FlowMaster, self).tick(timeout)\n  File \"/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/mitmproxy/controller.py\", line 39, in tick\n    handle_func(obj)\n  File \"/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/mitmproxy/dump.py\", line 334, in handle_response\n    flow.FlowMaster.handle_response(self, f)\n  File \"/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/mitmproxy/flow.py\", line 1039, in handle_response\n    self.process_new_response(f)\n  File \"/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/mitmproxy/flow.py\", line 936, in process_new_response\n    self.stickycookie_state.handle_response(f)\n  File \"/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/mitmproxy/flow.py\", line 337, in handle_response\n    c = http_cookies.SimpleCookie(str(i))\n  File \"/usr/lib/python2.7/Cookie.py\", line 583, in **init**\n    if input: self.load(input)\n  File \"/usr/lib/python2.7/Cookie.py\", line 640, in load\n    self.__ParseString(rawdata)\n  File \"/usr/lib/python2.7/Cookie.py\", line 677, in __ParseString\n    self.__set(K, rval, cval)\n  File \"/usr/lib/python2.7/Cookie.py\", line 589, in __set\n    M.set(key, real_value, coded_value)\n  File \"/usr/lib/python2.7/Cookie.py\", line 459, in set\n    raise CookieError(\"Illegal key value: %s\" % key)\nCookie.CookieError: Illegal key value: _csrf/link\n\nI would submit a fix myself, but I'm a bit swamped with other work right now\n##### Any other comments?\n\n---\n\nMitmproxy Version: 0.18\nOperating System: Ubuntu\n","closed_by":{"login":"Kriechi","id":114300,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNDMwMA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/114300?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kriechi","html_url":"https://github.com/Kriechi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kriechi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kriechi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kriechi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kriechi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kriechi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kriechi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kriechi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kriechi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kriechi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/issues/1118/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/issues/1118/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
