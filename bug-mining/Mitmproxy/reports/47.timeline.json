Some more detail on them: http://invisible-island.net/xterm/xterm.faq.html#xterm_tite\n\nThe output stays on the linux console in Debian as the termtype of `linux` doesn't have smcup/rmcup so I would assume that terminal also doesn't deal with them and they are ignored. \n\nOf note, `urwid` doesn't respect the current terminal type or local termcap and just uses the sequences it has coded in [`urwid/escape.py`](https://github.com/wardi/urwid/blob/master/urwid/escape.py#L402-L403).  Someone had raised the issue https://github.com/wardi/urwid/issues/33 but that was hacked around instead of resolved. \n\nThese are the sequences `urwid` uses:\n\n```\nSWITCH_TO_ALTERNATE_BUFFER = ESC+\"7\"+ESC+\"[?47h\"\nRESTORE_NORMAL_BUFFER = ESC+\"[?47l\"+ESC+\"8\"\n```\n\nThe additional escape 7 saves the cursor position and escape 8, restores it. \n\n`urwid` adds in the extra `clear`
