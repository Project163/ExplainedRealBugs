Description\r\n\r\nissue #5198 mitmWeb crashed when scroll the window, and get error message like this:\r\nError: Maximum update depth exceeded. This can happen when a component repeatedly calls setState inside componentWillUpdate or componentDidUpdate. React limits the number of nested updates to prevent infinite loops.\r\n\r\ncode Logic:\r\nFunction \"onViewportUpdate()\" is used to control how many flows displayed in flow-table, In component FlowTable(components/Modal/FlowTable.jsx).\r\nWhen user scroll the \"flow-table\", the procedure is as follows:\r\n  step1 div whose className is\"flow-table\" onScroll callback onViewportUpdate() is called\r\n  step2 setState({vScroll, viewportTop}) after calcVScroll()\r\n  step3 componentDidUpdate() is called to update component \"FlowTable\"\r\n  step4 onViewportUpdate() is called again\r\n  step5 normally calcVScroll() will get same result with step2, and setState() is not called\r\n\r\nwhy crash?\r\nFlow-item's default height is '32px', but when some flow-item's height is not '32px', the viewport.scrollTop will be different in step1 and step3. This was because that step3 is after flow-tiem's render(), and the real flow-item's height is used, such as '38.5px' not '32px'. In this case step5 will do setState(), and do step3-step5 again.\r\n\r\nAs an example: when the scrollbar is at a specific position, calcVScroll() calculates flow-item 32-52 will be displayed,  in step2. Bacause of a heigher flow-item, calcVScroll() may calculates flow-item 30-50 will be displayed, in step5, and do setStete(). In the next loop of step3-step5, flow-item 30-50 do not contain the higher flow-item, calcVScroll() get result of flow-item 32-52 again, and do component upDate again.....\r\nResult in an endless loop, and then you will get the Crash.\r\n\r\nwhich flow-item has a higher？\r\nThe flow-item cannot \"play\" or \"repeat\", such as TCP and websocket:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/110232125/182064241-9febdf8c-a59c-4849-9c84-79f12f432d51.png)\r\n\r\nHow to fix?\r\nMy way to fix this bug is to change higher flow-items to default height '32px'.\r\nIn FlowColumn() (components/FlowTable/FlowColumns.tsx), there was a if {...} else if {...}, but no else {} for default case. I try to add an else {} branch for default case, and mitmWeb do not crash in my computer.\r\n\r\n#### Checklist\r\n\r\n - [ ] I have updated tests where applicable.\r\n - [ ] I have added an entry to the CHANGELOG.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/issues/5507/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/issues/5507/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"actor":{"login":"Prinzhorn","id":679144,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY3OTE0NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/679144?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Prinzhorn","html_url":"https://github.com/Prinzhorn","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Prinzhorn/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Prinzhorn/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Prinzhorn/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Prinzhorn/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Prinzhorn/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Prinzhorn/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Prinzhorn/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Prinzhorn/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Prinzhorn/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-08-11T14:06:35Z","updated_at":"2022-08-11T14:06:35Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/issues/5525","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mitmproxy/mitmproxy","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/issues/5525/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/issues/5525/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/issues/5525/events","html_url":"https://github.com/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/issues/5525","id":1335883440,"node_id":"I_kwDOAAfumM5Pn_aw","number":5525,"title":"React
