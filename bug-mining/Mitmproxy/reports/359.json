Set up an HTTPS mitmproxy\n2. Run the following (minimized) code against it:\n\n``` python\nimport httplib\nconn = httplib.HTTPSConnection('<your proxy IP>',<your proxy port>)\nconn.set_tunnel('www.google.com',443)\nconn.request('GET','https://www.google.com:443/')\nresp = conn.getresponse()\nprint resp.read()\n```\n##### What is the expected behavior?\n\n``` html\n<HTML><HEAD><meta http-equiv=\"content-type\" content=\"text/html;charset=utf-8\">\n<TITLE>301 Moved</TITLE></HEAD><BODY>\n<H1>301 Moved</H1>\nThe document has moved\n<A HREF=\"http://www.google.com/\">here</A>.\n</BODY></HTML>\n```\n##### What went wrong?\n\n``` html\n<html>\n            <head>\n                <title>400 Bad Request</title>\n            </head>\n            <body>HttpException('Invalid request scheme: https',)</body>\n        </html>\n```\n##### Any other comments?\n\nI believe it's caused by a combination of https://github.com/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/blob/master/libmproxy/protocol/http.py#L544-L545 and https://github.com/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/blob/master/libmproxy/protocol/http.py#L502-L503. Indeed, if you modify my `GET` request above to ask for just `/` instead of `https://www.google.com:443/`, everything works fine.\n\nI'm not sure if it's sensible to support absolute-form requests over https tunnels, but I'm getting this behavior in real code (boto for python AWS) so I don't think it's very a contrived situation.\n\n---\n\nmitmproxy version: 0.14.0\n","closed_by":{"login":"mhils","id":1019198,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMTkxOTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1019198?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils","html_url":"https://github.com/mhils","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/issues/848/reactions","total_count":7,"+1":7,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/issues/848/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
