proxy shutdown, we run the final `done` event for all addons after the event loop exits. This guarantees that `done` is the last event, and that we don't have other events slipping into addons after `done` has already been called. Logs are \"just another event\", and in this case the event is not handled by any logger addons, both because those addons are now shut down, and because the event loop is no longer running. The relevant code is here:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/blob/master/mitmproxy/master.py#L80-L101\r\n\r\n- I really want to mark this as \"works as expected\", and document it in the event documentation. The `done` event may be invoked after the event loop exits, and you should not expect any further events to be handled. Any other solution is going to be worse. We could special-case log events, queue them up, and then consume them on exit. That doesn't solve the problem, though - we want to guarantee that addons receive no events after shutdown, and all addons have already received the `done` event. There's also nothing to prevent a `log` event from putting another event onto the loop (e.g. for remote logging). \r\n- A confounding factor here is the magic that turns prints to stdout into a log event. It's very surprising that a `print` statement might run but never produce output. It's much less surprising that `ctx.log.info` might not produce output on shutdown. I've never agreed with the magic approach: it's made many small things more complicated while working on the code, it's confusing to users, and setting up the handler is a constant performance penalty in a hot part of our code we will be optimising soon. I'd like to remove this in favour of explicit logging. If we really want we can have a `printlog` decorator or context handler that turns prints into a log for users that feel this makes sense. \r\n\r\n\r\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/issues/comments/386909581/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"cortesi","id":22544,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNTQ0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22544?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cortesi","html_url":"https://github.com/cortesi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cortesi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cortesi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cortesi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cortesi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cortesi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cortesi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cortesi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cortesi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cortesi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/issues/comments/386912241","html_url":"https://github.com/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/issues/3102#issuecomment-386912241","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/issues/3102","id":386912241,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM4NjkxMjI0MQ==","user":{"login":"mhils","id":1019198,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMTkxOTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1019198?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils","html_url":"https://github.com/mhils","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-05-06T20:47:51Z","updated_at":"2018-05-06T20:47:51Z","body":"> I really want to mark this as \"works as expected\", and document it in the event documentation.
