Description\r\n\r\nFixes #4476 \r\nThis PR adds the already existing `content_view_lines_cutoff` option to `mitmdump` to filter the number of content lines shown when `flow_detail` option is set to `3`. By default this option's value is set to `512`\r\n\r\nUpdated tests that check for `cutoff` in responses that cross `512` lines(with the default value set)\r\nAdded tests to ensure that custom values for `content_view_lines_cutoff` works as intended\r\n\r\n#### Verification\r\n1. run `mitmdump --set flow_detail=3 --set content_view_lines_cutoff=3`\r\n2. run `curl --proxy http:/127.0.0.1:8080 \"https://google.com/\"`\r\n\r\n#### Before\r\n<details>\r\n<summary>Output</summary>\r\n\r\n```\r\n[15:00:41.441] HTTP(S) proxy listening at *:8080.\r\n[15:00:53.236][127.0.0.1:38826] client connect\r\n[15:00:53.520][127.0.0.1:38826] server connect google.com:443 (142.250.183.238:443)\r\n127.0.0.1:38826: GET https://google.com/ HTTP/2.0\r\n    user-agent: curl/8.5.0\r\n    accept: */*\r\n\r\n << HTTP/2.0 301 Moved Permanently 220b\r\n    location: https://www.google.com/\r\n    content-type: text/html;
