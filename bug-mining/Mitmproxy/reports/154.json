Install `mitmproxy` on Debian Jessie from `git` following the steps from [here](http://docs.mitmproxy.org/en/stable/install.html) and [here](https://github.com/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/blob/master/README.rst#hacking)\n2. Run `mitmproxy -w somefile` and connect a device to it as usual\n3. Press `oI` and add `.*` to the list of ignore patterns\n4. Hit `qq` and see connections from your device still appearing in the interface.\n##### What is the expected behavior?\n\n`mitmproxy` interface should behave as if there were no connections going through it, e.g. the interface should not display them and they should not be stored in the dump file.\n##### What went wrong?\n\n`mitmproxy` ignored `--ignore` patterns.\n##### Any other comments?\n\n$ mitmproxy --version\nmitmproxy 0.18\n\nI have built `mitmproxy` with the latest commit being [this one](https://github.com/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/commit/423c076c61140c2e953313793263a4cac71e33ca).\n\n---\n\nMitmproxy Version: https://github.com/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/commit/423c076c61140c2e953313793263a4cac71e33ca\nOperating System: Debian Jessie ARM\n","closed_by":{"login":"mhils","id":1019198,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMTkxOTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1019198?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils","html_url":"https://github.com/mhils","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/issues/1089/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/issues/1089/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
