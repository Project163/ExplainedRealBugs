I was able to track it down to the async `client_connected` hook not working. It does work in 10.0.0 and broken in 10.2.4. Not sure about other hooks, this one starts the entire chain and hence that's where all connections end.\r\n\r\n#### Steps to reproduce the behavior:\r\n\r\naddon.py\r\n\r\n```py\r\nimport asyncio\r\n\r\n\r\nasync def client_connected(client):\r\n    print(\"client_connected...\")\r\n    await asyncio.sleep(1)\r\n    print(\"...client_connected\")\r\n```\r\n\r\n1. `mitmdump --scripts addon.py`\r\n2. `curl --insecure --proxy localhost:8080 https://example.com/`\r\n\r\nMitmproxy 9.0.1 output:\r\n\r\n```\r\n[10:02:00.891] Loading script addon.py\r\n[10:02:00.892] HTTP(S) proxy listening at *:8080.\r\n[10:02:03.639][[::1]:37674] client connect\r\nclient_connected...\r\n...client_connected\r\n[10:02:04.746][[::1]:37674] server connect example.com:443 ([2606:2800:220:1:248:1893:25c8:1946]:443)\r\n[::1]:37674: GET https://example.com/ HTTP/2.0\r\n << HTTP/2.0 200 OK 1.2k\r\n[10:02:05.091][[::1]:37674] client disconnect\r\n[10:02:05.092][[::1]:37674] server disconnect example.com:443 ([2606:2800:220:1:248:1893:25c8:1946]:443)\r\n```\r\n\r\nMitmproxy 10.0.0 output:\r\n\r\n```\r\n[10:06:17.770] Loading script addon.py\r\n[10:06:17.771] HTTP(S) proxy listening at *:8080.\r\n[10:06:19.790][[::1]:33394] client connect\r\nclient_connected...\r\n...client_connected\r\n[10:06:20.898][[::1]:33394] server connect example.com:443 ([2606:2800:220:1:248:1893:25c8:1946]:443)\r\n[::1]:33394: GET https://example.com/ HTTP/2.0\r\n << HTTP/2.0 200 OK 1.2k\r\n[10:06:21.241][[::1]:33394] client disconnect\r\n[10:06:21.241][[::1]:33394] server disconnect example.com:443 ([2606:2800:220:1:248:1893:25c8:1946]:443)\r\n```\r\n\r\nMitmproxy 10.2.4 output:\r\n\r\n```\r\n[10:03:04.389] Loading script addon.py\r\n[10:03:04.389] HTTP(S) proxy listening at *:8080.\r\n[10:03:07.451][[::1]:35406] client connect\r\nclient_connected...\r\n...client_connected\r\n[10:03:08.452][[::1]:35406] mitmproxy has crashed!\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n  File \"mitmproxy/proxy/server.py\", line 381, in server_event\r\n  File \"mitmproxy/proxy/layer.py\", line 148, in handle_event\r\n  File \"mitmproxy/proxy/utils.py\", line 27, in _check_event_type\r\nAssertionError: Unexpected event type at HttpProxy._handle_event: Expected Start, got DataReceived(client, b'CONNECT example.com:443 HTTP/1.1\\r\\nHost: example.com:443\\r\\nUser-Agent: curl/8.2.1\\r\\nProxy-Connection: Keep-Alive\\r\\n\\r\\n').\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### System Information\r\n\r\n```\r\nMitmproxy: 10.2.4 binary\r\nPython:    3.12.2\r\nOpenSSL:   OpenSSL 3.2.1 30 Jan 2024\r\nPlatform:  Linux-6.5.0-25-generic-x86_64-with-glibc2.38\r\n```","closed_by":{"login":"mhils","id":1019198,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMTkxOTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1019198?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils","html_url":"https://github.com/mhils","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/issues/6745/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/issues/6745/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
