Steps to reproduce the problem:\r\n \r\n1. Mark multiple flows in the flow list using `m` key  \r\n2. Toggle to show-marked-only view using `M`\r\n3. mitmproxy rearranges flow list when `M` is toggled\r\n\r\n\r\n##### Any other comments? What have you tried so far?\r\n\r\nThis is an issue with the flow list mentioned earlier in #1960. The marked flows can get randomly rearranged whenever M or Z is pressed, as it iterates through `view._store` which is a dictionary, to refresh the view.\r\n\r\n##### System
