This means that both subject and authority key identifiers are the same (and the same as root CA subject key identifier). What I *think* is happening is that Windows CryptoAPI validates the subject against itself instead of its issuer - mitmproxy root CA. It tracks with my previous testing where .NET `HttpClient` fails [even in custom trust mode](https://github.com/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/discussions/6435#discussioncomment-7588209).\r\n\r\nWe could generate a separate private key (either temporary or persisted). A temporary key could be stored in memory and reused during the lifetime of the session, a persistent key could be stored in the same manner as root CA certificates are stored now.\r\n\r\nI can look into it tomorrow, however I don't know how much time I'll have to make a proper PR for this.\r\n\r\n**EDIT:**  \r\nOk, so I've also looked at the code some more and it seems to me that we already have a mechanism to persist temporary keys in the certificate store. As it is now certificate store creation procedure `from_store` loads persisted certificates and sets defaults (CA values), these defaults are later used for generating dummy certificates. Correct me if I'm wrong, but we should be able to change the defaults here with a newly generated private key and it should work.\r\n\r\n**EDIT 2:**  \r\nIt seems to work just fine, made a quick fork and tested it on my Windows laptop. I'm not sure how exactly the pull request process works around here (I obviously can't create branches on this repository), but I'd be willing to spend some more time and update relevant use cases in tests and examples during the next week or
