using the -s option of mitmproxy 0.10.1, if a space is present in the script's path, mitmproxy gives this error, even when using quotes around the path:\n`# mitmproxy -s \"/path with spaces/script.py\"`\n`Script load error: Command not found.`\n\nIt used to work in mitmproxy 0.9.2 and the problem doesn't exist with the -w parameter for example.\n\nUsing \"\\ \" instead of spaces
