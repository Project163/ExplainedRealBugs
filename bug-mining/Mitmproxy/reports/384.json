After a bit of digging, it seems that setting `stream_large_bodies` triggers the issue - even if response is way below the threshold.\r\n\r\n#### Steps to reproduce the behavior:\r\n1. Start mitmproxy: `mitmproxy --set stream_large_bodies=10m` - 10 MB threshold\r\n2. Make an HTTP/2 request, i.e. `curl -x 127.0.0.1:8080 -L https://www.google.com 1>/dev/null`\r\n3. Check request in mitmproxy - `[content missing]` despite response size is way below threshold - 14438 bytes.\r\n4. Events:\r\n```\r\ninfo: 127.0.0.1:59143: clientconnect\r\ninfo: Streaming response from www.google.com\r\ninfo: 127.0.0.1:59143: clientdisconnect\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### System Information\r\n```\r\nMitmproxy: 6.0.2\r\nPython:    3.9.2\r\nOpenSSL:   OpenSSL 1.1.1j  16 Feb 2021\r\nPlatform:  macOS-11.2.1-x86_64-i386-64bit\r\n```\r\n\r\nRequests HTTP/1.1 seems to be not affected. Also, I can't reproduce it on Ubuntu running via WSL1.
