it is not necessary to mutate the response, the following script suffices to make it crash:\n\n```\nfrom mitmproxy.script import concurrent\n\n@concurrent\ndef request(context, flow):\n    print('start request: %s%s' % (flow.request.host, flow.request.path))\n\ndef response(context, flow):\n    print('finish response: %s%s' % (flow.request.host, flow.request.path))\n```\n\nIt seems that visiting any website that is not available in the recording provided using `-S` makes mitmproxy crash, when `@concurrent`, `-s` and `--kill` are all used at the same
