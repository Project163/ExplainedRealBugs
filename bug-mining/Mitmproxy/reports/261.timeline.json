Overview\r\nCerts provided through the --cert argument or config yaml get stored in the certs dictionary as a str. This causes issues because the keys created by get_certs method are byte strings. So any provided certs wind up being ignored and the generated certs still get stored as byte strings.\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n1. Start the proxy and provide a cert through the command line or config.yaml options:\r\n\r\n  ```bash\r\n  mitmproxy --cert [domain=path to pem]\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n2. Attach to the process using the debugger and set a breakpoint in `certs.py` at the `get_cert` method.  \r\n3. Step through the method until you get to `if name:`\r\n\r\nThis was found when trying to modify requests while keeping certificate pinning enabled using a second cert I have pinned and have the private key to. Once I converted the spec to bytes the domain and certificate were correctly identified.\r\n\r\nAdditional Info:\r\nMid 2014 MacBook Pro with 15\" Retina Display\r\nmacOS Sierra 10.12.5\r\nPython 3.6.1\r\nmitmproxy installed through Homebrew 1.2.4.\r\n\r\n![masked-screen-1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/930927/30389914-54a73bf6-9882-11e7-9c6d-73afad635518.jpg)\r\n![masked-screen-2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/930927/30389915-54af5bf6-9882-11e7-94c1-dc230b6d3705.jpg)\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/issues/2570/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/issues/2570/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
