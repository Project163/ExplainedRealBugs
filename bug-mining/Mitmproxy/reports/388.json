The FTP server has a limit of five connections. If I try to connect a sixth time mitmproxy runs into the following assertion:\r\n\r\n```\r\nerror: *.*.*.*:47774: mitmproxy has crashed!\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n  File \"mitmproxy/proxy/server.py\", line 282, in server_event\r\nAssertionError\r\n```\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/blob/64961232e6addec4abb27835d1b4efd0cdb7bb10/mitmproxy/proxy/server.py#L282\r\n\r\n#### Steps to reproduce the behavior:\r\n\r\nFTP Server on port 10022 with a connection limit of 1:\r\n\r\n```sh\r\ndocker run -it --rm -p 10022:21 -p 30000-30009:30000-30009 \\\r\n  -e FTP_USER_NAME=prinzhorn \\\r\n  -e FTP_USER_PASS=prinzhorn \\\r\n  -e FTP_USER_HOME=/home/prinzhorn \\\r\n  -e FTP_PASSIVE_PORTS=30000:30009 \\\r\n  -e FTP_MAX_CLIENTS=1 \\\r\n  -e \"ADDED_FLAGS=-d -d\" \\\r\n  stilliard/pure-ftpd\r\n```\r\n\r\nMitmproxy on 10021 in reverse:\r\n\r\n```sh\r\n./mitmproxy \\\r\n  --ssl-insecure \\\r\n  --listen-port 10021 \\\r\n  --listen-host 0 \\\r\n  --mode reverse:http://localhost:10022 \\\r\n  --set connection_strategy=eager \\\r\n  --set block_global=false \\\r\n  --tcp-hosts '.*'\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow connect twice to 10021, e.g. I was using two FileZilla tabs.
