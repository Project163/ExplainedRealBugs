If the site was not replayed but loaded from the original server than it printed something with `<<` but without `[replay]`. But this was not done with the master version from yesterday. Thus it was harder to find #774. \nThe output from mitmdump was moved to click instead of print, I think. After a search I found out that the `handle_request` function of dump.py is the point of my ambition. It response on a request but did not print anything. Thus I added the line\n\n```\nself.echo_flow(f)\n```\n\nafter `f.reply()` and the replay output is back.\nI think this is a bug and that it affects the option `-d`, too. If neither is true, I'm sorry for this report.\n","closed_by":{"login":"mhils","id":1019198,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMTkxOTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1019198?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils","html_url":"https://github.com/mhils","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/issues/775/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/issues/775/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
