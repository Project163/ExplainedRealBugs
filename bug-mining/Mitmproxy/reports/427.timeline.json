Problem Description\r\nI sometimes notice that web pages loaded with HTTP/2 in my browser sometimes stop loading images. I am trying to narrow this issue down. My first suspicion is the code in server.py as in #5034 we already noticed that exceptions are silently ignored in certain tasks.\r\n\r\nI wrapped all tasks in try-except to see if there are any exceptions that cause tasks to die that was not expected. I found this:\r\n\r\n```\r\n[2022-02-26 20:56:41] 192.168.2.63:60214: Traceback (most recent call last):\r\n[2022-02-26 20:56:41]   File \"/home/enduser/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/proxy/server.py\", line 266, in handle_connection\r\n[2022-02-26 20:56:41]     await self.drain_writers()\r\n[2022-02-26 20:56:41]   File \"/home/enduser/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/proxy/server.py\", line 308, in drain_writers\r\n[2022-02-26 20:56:41]     await transport.writer.drain()\r\n[2022-02-26 20:56:41]   File \"/usr/lib64/python3.9/asyncio/streams.py\", line 387, in drain\r\n[2022-02-26 20:56:41]     await self._protocol._drain_helper()\r\n[2022-02-26 20:56:41]   File \"/usr/lib64/python3.9/asyncio/streams.py\", line 194, in _drain_helper\r\n[2022-02-26 20:56:41]     assert waiter is None or waiter.cancelled()\r\n[2022-02-26 20:56:41] AssertionError\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis assertion comes from within the `asyncio` code. Any idea what test could be done in `drain_writers` for each writer in order to not trigger the assertion? I am now running a modified version of `drain_writers` that looks like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\n        for transport in self.transports.values():\r\n            if transport.writer is not None:\r\n                try:\r\n                    await transport.writer.drain()\r\n                except OSError as e:\r\n                    if transport.handler is not None:\r\n                        asyncio_utils.cancel_task(transport.handler, f\"Error sending data: {e}\")\r\n                except AssertionError:\r\n                    pass\r\n```\r\nUgly but I will run this for a while to see if that is the reason for my missing images.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/issues/5158/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/issues/5158/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/issues/comments/1053515872","html_url":"https://github.com/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/issues/5159#issuecomment-1053515872","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/issues/5159","id":1053515872,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAAfumM4-y2Bg","user":{"login":"mhils","id":1019198,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMTkxOTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1019198?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils","html_url":"https://github.com/mhils","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-02-27T11:20:34Z","updated_at":"2022-02-27T11:20:34Z","body":"I
