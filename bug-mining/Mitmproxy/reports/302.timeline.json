main problem of this issue is absence of `view_grideditor` in mitmproxy v3.0.0\r\n\r\nAn exception occurs in this line https://github.com/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/blob/master/mitmproxy/tools/console/grideditor/col_subgrid.py#L30\r\n`view_grideditor` in mitmproxy v2.0.x pushes the whole widget into the stack, but in v3.0.0 we have `push` method instead of `view_grideditor`, which pushes only the name and then mitmproxy retrieves necessary widget by its name from `self.windows`. \r\nI had a few variants of how to fix it and I am not sure I chose the best one :)\r\n\r\nFirst of all, we must fix another related issue, which I described in the comments https://github.com/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/issues/2753#issuecomment-359825373. It happens because of this https://github.com/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/blob/master/mitmproxy/tools/console/grideditor/base.py#L465. The thing is when we switch view to other tab and then come back to grideditor, `focus_changed` is invoked and it creates completely new widget, which doesn't consider our previous editings. It is logical to assume, that we mustn't create a new object every time we come back to grideditor. I replaced `focus_changed` with `layout_pushed`, so new widget will be created every time, only when we push grideditor.\r\n\r\nFixing the current issue:\r\n- put attributes editor object into `self.windows`;\r\n- when pressing `enter` we must pass `editor` from `Column.keypress` to `CookieAttributeEditor` and switch view to attribute editor;\r\n- `layout_pushed` is invoked and we get into attribute editor.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/issues/2814/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/issues/2814/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":1449393531,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MTQ0OTM5MzUzMQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/issues/events/1449393531","actor":{"login":"mhils","id":1019198,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMTkxOTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1019198?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils","html_url":"https://github.com/mhils","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":"4bb22bbe8a9caa4100b50a054dd720b4fdbf0edf","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/commits/4bb22bbe8a9caa4100b50a054dd720b4fdbf0edf","created_at":"2018-01-30T20:19:43Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":1449393533,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDE0NDkzOTM1MzM=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/issues/events/1449393533","actor":{"login":"mhils","id":1019198,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMTkxOTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1019198?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils","html_url":"https://github.com/mhils","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"02d2ef75060784b1eec9db81e62edf4b058f86fa","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/commits/02d2ef75060784b1eec9db81e62edf4b058f86fa","created_at":"2018-01-30T20:19:43Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"actor":{"login":"snyk-bot","id":19733683,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NzMzNjgz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19733683?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/snyk-bot","html_url":"https://github.com/snyk-bot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/snyk-bot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/snyk-bot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/snyk-bot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/snyk-bot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/snyk-bot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/snyk-bot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/snyk-bot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/snyk-bot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/snyk-bot/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-01-19T21:13:56Z","updated_at":"2020-01-19T21:13:56Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ibuystuff/mitmproxy/issues/5","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ibuystuff/mitmproxy","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ibuystuff/mitmproxy/issues/5/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ibuystuff/mitmproxy/issues/5/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ibuystuff/mitmproxy/issues/5/events","html_url":"https://github.com/ibuystuff/mitmproxy/pull/5","id":551986644,"node_id":"MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0MzY0NTgwNTg3","number":5,"title":"[Snyk]
