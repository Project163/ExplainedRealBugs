Run mitmproxy\n2. Visit https://www.websocket.org/echo.html\n3. Send some messages\n##### What is the expected behavior?\n\nThe Websocket activity should be reflected in the UI.\n##### What went wrong?\n\nThere is no UI indication that any activity is ongoing after the initial 101 Upgrade.\n##### Any other comments? What have you tried so far?\n\nSimilar to our TCP mode, we should have a `--websocket/--no-websocket` switch to control if the WS protocol is enabled. As we don't have a UI integration for this either, I would suggest to keep it turned off by default.\n\nSetting this as a release blocker because the current master version swallows WS contents without showing something.\n\n---\n\nMitmproxy Version: master\nOperating System: Win10 x64\n","closed_by":{"login":"mhils","id":1019198,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMTkxOTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1019198?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils","html_url":"https://github.com/mhils","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/issues/1546/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/issues/1546/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
