After all, it should be as good as if no proxy is in place (except for the eventual SSL penalty).\nThe tcp proxying is more a proof of concept than anything else at the moment. As you already pointed out, the timeout in the first select call can/should probably be omitted.\nDo you experience actual performance issues (100% CPU on one core) or some other kind of bottleneck?\n\nIf you can make any sensible, improvements that improve the experience for you, please submit a PR! :-)\n\nThanks!\nMax\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/issues/comments/44855895/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"mhils","id":1019198,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMTkxOTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1019198?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils","html_url":"https://github.com/mhils","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":127091720,"node_id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDEyNzA5MTcyMA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/issues/events/127091720","actor":{"login":"mhils","id":1019198,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMTkxOTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1019198?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils","html_url":"https://github.com/mhils","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2014-06-02T15:59:41Z","label":{"name":"0.11","color":"fbca04"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":145960793,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MTQ1OTYwNzkz","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/issues/events/145960793","actor":{"login":"mhils","id":1019198,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMTkxOTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1019198?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils","html_url":"https://github.com/mhils","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":"2b31a9c49e8dab2955121a7d748f4a73837e4267","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/commits/2b31a9c49e8dab2955121a7d748f4a73837e4267","created_at":"2014-07-27T00:40:08Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
