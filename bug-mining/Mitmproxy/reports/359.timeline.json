for investigating this!\n\n> I'm not sure if it's sensible to support absolute-form requests over https tunnels\n\nUnfortunately, it's part of the spec that every HTTP1 request can be in absolute-form. I haven't seen it in practice before this though.\n\nFor us, it's a nontrivial UI/UX problem. Cosider an initial CONNECT request\n\n``` http\nCONNECT 10.0.0.1 HTTP/1.1\n```\n\nfollowed by this HTTP request:\n\n``` http\nGET http://example.com/ HTTP/1.1\nContent-Length: 42\n[...]\n```\n\nWe now have two different destinations - which one should we show to the user? There's no guarantee that the host in the second request isn't fake and just showing \"example.org\" while we actually transmit data to $evilip is bad. However, we shouldn't omit the destination from the URL in the UI either.\nOur current workaround is to require relative-form requests if we already have a known destination. We also catch a lot of user errors this way (e.g. people who run mitmproxy in transparent mode while configuring it on the client as well). There's also our \"smart\" `request.host` attribute for scripts which would need to deal with this issue as well.\n\nTL;DR: Yes, we _should_ support this as it's perfectly valid HTTP. On the other hand, we'd need to make quite a few tradeoffs for a feature that is rarely used :confused:\n\n> It actually seems to mess with the way the request goes through to the final destination though, and breaks AWS's request signing after it makes its way through the proxy.\n\nI _think_ this is caused by [libmproxy/protocol/http.py#L497-L503](https://github.com/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/blob/b5d5e56fdb32717ab8f4c99c4f31c56df46afa91/libmproxy/protocol/http.py#L497-L503), which implicitly assumes relative-form requests.\n\nOne way to approach this problem would be to make the HTTP protocol support absolute-form transparent requests and add a `--relax-http` switch to mitmproxy which disables the validation part.

Isn't that already a problem with standard HTTP?\n\nIt is - it also affects mitmproxy's transparent mode the same way. Our issue is that we can't distinguish if the client is now talking to a proxy (which looks the same way) or just sends an absolute-form request for no reason. Even worse, an attacker may use this to actively misguide an analyst.\nFor a mitmproxy user, it should always be clear where requests are going to, so we decided to just fail in these ambigious situations.\n\nFor the host header, it's a bit different in the sense as the presence of the Host header cannot be mistaken for a proxy request. Thus, you can pass `--host` to mitmproxy and we will use that as display source in transparent mode.\n\n> That seems fine, although I still don't quite see what part of the code is breaking my request signature, even if we removed the sanity checks.\n\nWe fill in (in the absolute-form case: overwrite) attributes of the request from the connection metadata in transparent mode: [libmproxy/protocol/http.py#L497-L503](https://github.com/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/blob/b5d5e56fdb32717ab8f4c99c4f31c56df46afa91/libmproxy/protocol/http.py#L497-L503)\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/issues/comments/160967927/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"mhils","id":1019198,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMTkxOTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1019198?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils","html_url":"https://github.com/mhils","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/issues/comments/160988297","html_url":"https://github.com/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/issues/848#issuecomment-160988297","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/issues/848","id":160988297,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE2MDk4ODI5Nw==","user":{"login":"copumpkin","id":2623,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MjM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2623?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/copumpkin","html_url":"https://github.com/copumpkin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copumpkin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copumpkin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copumpkin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copumpkin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copumpkin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copumpkin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copumpkin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copumpkin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copumpkin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-12-01T14:48:12Z","updated_at":"2015-12-01T14:48:12Z","body":"> We fill in (in the absolute-form case: overwrite) attributes of the request from the connection metadata in transparent mode: libmproxy/protocol/http.py#L497-L503\n\nYeah, sorry, I meant I couldn't tell within that what specifically was breaking boto's AWS signature.
