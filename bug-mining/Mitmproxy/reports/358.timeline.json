However, that domain is exactly 65 characters long, whereas the CN field is limited to 64 characters. Hence we don't set a subject and only a SubjectAltName. The Java client is right to point out that we need to set this extension as critical then (see https://stackoverflow.com/a/56169246/934719).\r\n\r\nCould you verify that the PR linked below fixes your
