I still have a couple of questions about this though:\n  - is there a command to replay ALL the flows in the list ?\n  - why are the \"inline scripts\" callbacks called during this \"flows load stage\", but the 'request' callback isn't called when the flow is replayed with 'r' ? (cf. http://mitmproxy.org/doc/scripting/inlinescripts.html )\n    To be more precise: when a HTTP response is received, the script is run through `flow.py:FlowMaster.handle_response()`, but when an HTTP request is sent, it goes through `replay_request()` and then `process_new_request()`, which does not call any script. Is this a design choice ?\n- finally, the rendering bug is a Heisenbug : since yesterday it disappeared, so I guess it was du to a console glitch, maybe with `tmux`. I'll post more details if I face it again\n","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/issues/comments/62252701/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"Lucas-C","id":925560,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyNTU2MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/925560?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lucas-C","html_url":"https://github.com/Lucas-C","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lucas-C/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lucas-C/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lucas-C/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lucas-C/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lucas-C/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lucas-C/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lucas-C/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lucas-C/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lucas-C/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/issues/comments/62263607","html_url":"https://github.com/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/issues/402#issuecomment-62263607","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/issues/402","id":62263607,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYyMjYzNjA3","user":{"login":"mhils","id":1019198,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMTkxOTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1019198?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils","html_url":"https://github.com/mhils","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-11-08T16:23:06Z","updated_at":"2014-11-08T16:23:06Z","body":"Thanks for the good report and keeping us updated.

I just commited a fix that should resolve your issue.\n\n> is there a command to replay ALL the flows in the list ?\n\nNot really. -> Save flows (`w a filename`), clear view (`C`), client replay (`c filename`).\n\n> why are the \"inline scripts\" callbacks called during this \"flows load stage\", but the 'request' callback isn't called when the flow is replayed with 'r' ? (cf. http://mitmproxy.org/doc/scripting/inlinescripts.html ) To be more precise: when a HTTP response is received, the script is run through flow.py:FlowMaster.handle_response(), but when an HTTP request is sent, it goes through replay_request() and then process_new_request(), which does not call any script. Is this a design choice ?\n\nNot really - we just didn't add all the hooks yet (`serverconnect` and `response` are missing), sorry. \nI opened a separate ticket for this (see above).\n\nCheers,\nMax\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/issues/comments/62410008/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"mhils","id":1019198,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMTkxOTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1019198?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils","html_url":"https://github.com/mhils","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/issues/comments/62809531","html_url":"https://github.com/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/issues/402#issuecomment-62809531","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/issues/402","id":62809531,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYyODA5NTMx","user":{"login":"Lucas-C","id":925560,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyNTU2MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/925560?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lucas-C","html_url":"https://github.com/Lucas-C","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lucas-C/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lucas-C/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lucas-C/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lucas-C/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lucas-C/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lucas-C/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lucas-C/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lucas-C/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lucas-C/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-11-12T22:45:43Z","updated_at":"2014-11-12T22:46:24Z","body":"Thanks a lot for your detailed answer !
