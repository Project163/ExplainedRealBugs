After some delving around - it seemed that the Application is using SPDY (over port 443), while mitmproxy wrongly detected the first SPDY packet as a part of an SSL handshake (for which it reports \"wrong version\" and terminates)\n\nDoes mitmproxy support SPDY? perhaps it can be a nice feature to add SPDY recognition (or ignoring it in the meanwhile and passing SPDY packets not through the proxy)\n\nThanks,\nYoav\n","closed_by":{"login":"mhils","id":1019198,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMTkxOTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1019198?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils","html_url":"https://github.com/mhils","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/issues/277/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/issues/277/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
