The two collide, but no error message is printed.\r\n- If you try to proxy your connections to 8081 as it's telling you, everything breaks.\r\n- This is mainly a problem because non-experienced users won't know that the web UI runs on port 8081, and because no error is printed when the two collide, the proxy just doesn't work for no apparent reason.\r\n\r\n#### Steps to reproduce the behavior:\r\n1. Run any service on port 8080 (anything works as long as it blocks that port).\r\n2. Run `mitmweb` (no arguments). A message is printed stating that port 8080 is taken and that you should switch to 8081 (!)\r\n3. If you switch to port 8081, no errors are printed but a collision with the web UI happens silently. The web UI opens telling you to point your proxy to port 8081, which doesn't work.\r\n\r\n#### System Information\r\n```\r\nMitmproxy: 9.0.1\r\nPython:    3.10.9\r\nOpenSSL:   OpenSSL 1.1.1s  1 Nov 2022\r\nPlatform:  macOS-13.2-arm64-arm-64bit\r\n```","closed_by":{"login":"mhils","id":1019198,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMTkxOTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1019198?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils","html_url":"https://github.com/mhils","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/issues/5891/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/issues/5891/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
