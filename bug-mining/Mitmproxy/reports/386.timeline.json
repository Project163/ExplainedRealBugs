Pick a parameter that accepts a sequence, e.g. `server_replay_ignore_params`. Try setting more than one value of it (so that you see multiple values in the Options view).\r\n2. `mitmproxy --set server_replay_ignore_params=value1 --set server_replay_ignore_params=value2` (only the latter is saved).\r\n3. `mitmproxy --set server_replay_ignore_params=value1 server_replay_ignore_params=value2` (parsing error).\r\n4. `mitmproxy --set server_replay_ignore_params=value1,value2`
