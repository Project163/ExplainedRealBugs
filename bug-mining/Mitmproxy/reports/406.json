Please describe.\r\n- Getting the timestamp of a request requires to select the flow and go the Details tab\r\n- If column is selected for sorting, there is no way to get back to a timeline related sorting\r\n- Following the flows requires to always scroll to the bottom to get the newest.\r\n\r\n#### Describe the solution you'd like\r\n- Add a Timestamp column related to the `First request byte` (origin of the timing of the flow)\r\n- Add a sorting functionality for that column\r\n- Add an option to keep the scroll bar at the bottom or a reverse order for the flows (added at the top instead of the bottom)\r\n\r\n#### Describe alternatives you've considered\r\n- Injecting Javascript to modify the scrollbar with the `scrollTo(x,y)` method from the `flow-table` div element. Tested via the JS console and working. But since the web interface is based on React, that would require modifying the source code directly.\r\n\r\n#### Additional context\r\nI am adding `mitmweb` as an extra feature for an existing transparent proxy web interface. It is mostly for realtime analysis of API calls. Multiple people will need to have access with their own environment (and filtering). Using the provided release binaries is a must to manage those environment without dealing with Python venv. I tried to modify the React code but I didn't find a way to recreate binaries like you provide in your releases.\r\n\r\nSince the analysis needed are based on time and realtime calls, having to always scroll down manually to follow the new flows and also having to select flows one by one to get the timestamp, those feature requests would be nice additions to your software.\r\n\r\nActually, I was reading the code and the options to be sure it was not already there since for me and I guess a lot else, it is a must have feature ;-)\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nO.","closed_by":{"login":"mhils","id":1019198,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMTkxOTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1019198?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils","html_url":"https://github.com/mhils","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/issues/4092/reactions","total_count":8,"+1":8,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/issues/4092/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
