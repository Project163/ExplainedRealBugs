I've got a hack that seems to fix it. If you replace:\r\n`l.extend([cookies.format_cookie_header(c[name].items(multi=True)) for name in c.keys()])`\r\nwith\r\n`l.extend([cookies.format_cookie_header([c[name].items(multi=True)[0]]) for name in c.keys()])`\r\n\r\nI don't like this solution, though.\r\n\r\nThe issue appears to be with how the cookies are stored in the sticky cookie implementation, as well as, to an extent, the `format_cookie_header()` implementation. Sticky cookies stores them as a list of `(key, value)` tuple lists, instead of a list of `(key, value, CookieAttrs[(k,v),(k,v)])` tuples as seems to be used elsewhere. `format_cookie_header()` expects a list of `(key, value)` tuples for each cookie. It is noteworthy that this seems broken at the moment, because the way it should work as currently implemented should give me cookies for every attribute.\r\n\r\nThe changes I would reccomend would be to have `format_cookie_header()` take a list `(key, value, CookieAttrs[(k,v),(k,v)])` tuples, same as `format_set_cookie_header()` and change the cookie jar in sticky cookies to store cookies in this same format. If there are big issues with this, the hack I mentioned above can be applied.","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/issues/comments/292640975/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"kitlith","id":7027737,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcwMjc3Mzc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7027737?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kitlith","html_url":"https://github.com/kitlith","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kitlith/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kitlith/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kitlith/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kitlith/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kitlith/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kitlith/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kitlith/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kitlith/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kitlith/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/issues/comments/295583166","html_url":"https://github.com/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/issues/2228#issuecomment-295583166","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/issues/2228","id":295583166,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI5NTU4MzE2Ng==","user":{"login":"kitlith","id":7027737,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcwMjc3Mzc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7027737?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kitlith","html_url":"https://github.com/kitlith","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kitlith/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kitlith/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kitlith/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kitlith/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kitlith/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kitlith/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kitlith/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kitlith/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kitlith/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-04-20T05:11:44Z","updated_at":"2017-04-20T05:11:44Z","body":"I'm
