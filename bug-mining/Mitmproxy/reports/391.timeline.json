Tracking this down:\r\n\r\n1. I first grep the log for \"The client may not trust the proxy's certificate\" to see that the connection with source port 58954 is affected.\r\n2. Next, I run `test/helper_tools/loggrep.py 58954 v7.log` to only see events relating to that connection.\r\n3. Refine with `test/helper_tools/loggrep.py 58954 v7.log | rg \"SendData|ConnectionClosed\" -C 1000` to highlight specific keywords.\r\n\r\nUsing that approach we see that the client unexpectedly disconnects while mitmproxy is negotiating TLS with the server. The error by itself is not wrong, but in this particular setting we can be more precise: We haven't presented a cert yet, so we can be sure that it's not because the CA is untrusted. The general problem is that some TLS clients just hang up after being presented with an untrusted cert, so we can't entirely avoid false-positives here.","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/issues/comments/879739201/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"mhils","id":1019198,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMTkxOTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1019198?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils","html_url":"https://github.com/mhils","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":5024396619,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDUwMjQzOTY2MTk=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/issues/events/5024396619","actor":{"login":"mhils","id":1019198,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMTkxOTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1019198?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils","html_url":"https://github.com/mhils","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"88086825e5c8654b89259d4f2d71292c1f45be64","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mhils/mitmproxy/commits/88086825e5c8654b89259d4f2d71292c1f45be64","created_at":"2021-07-15T09:54:12Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":5024438799,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50NTAyNDQzODc5OQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/issues/events/5024438799","actor":{"login":"mhils","id":1019198,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMTkxOTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1019198?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils","html_url":"https://github.com/mhils","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":"88086825e5c8654b89259d4f2d71292c1f45be64","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/commits/88086825e5c8654b89259d4f2d71292c1f45be64","created_at":"2021-07-15T10:02:28Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":5094682480,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDUwOTQ2ODI0ODA=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/issues/events/5094682480","actor":{"login":"ericbeland","id":56330,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2MzMw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/56330?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericbeland","html_url":"https://github.com/ericbeland","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericbeland/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericbeland/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericbeland/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericbeland/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericbeland/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericbeland/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericbeland/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericbeland/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericbeland/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"2989178d88479ba4e9c0a39d41a
