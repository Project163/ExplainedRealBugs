There was an issue with showing correct Host headers however, so I tried to upgrade to 3.0.4 and found that transparent mode now doesn't work at all. On every client request mitmweb shows the following error message:\r\n\r\n> Transparent mode failure: RuntimeError('Cannot resolve original destination.',)\r\n\r\nI've tried previous mitmproxy releases and found that this functionality was broken starting from v3.0.0 \r\nRC2. I do understand that this mode is not \"officially\" supported on Windows, but since it used to work, I hope it can be fixed :)\r\n\r\n##### Steps to reproduce the problem:\r\n\r\n1. Enable IP forwarding (https://gist.github.com/mhils/e9769fab7b1dd0775335)\r\n2. Set port redirection, e.g.:\r\n> netsh interface portproxy add v4tov4 listenport=80 connectaddress=192.168.0.90 connectport=8080\r\n> netsh interface portproxy add v4tov4 listenport=443 connectaddress=192.168.0.90 connectport=8080\r\n3. Start mitmproxy in transparent mode:\r\n> mitmweb.exe --mode transparent --showhost\r\n4. Install mitmproxy certificate on the phone\r\n5. Set default gateway in phone's Wi-Fi connection properties to the mitmproxy host (e.g. 192.168.0.90)\r\n6. Open any website in phone's browser\r\n\r\n##### System information\r\n\r\nMitmproxy: 3.0.4 binary\r\nPython:    3.6.4\r\nOpenSSL:   OpenSSL 1.1.0h  27 Mar 2018\r\nPlatform:  Windows-10-10.0.16299\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"mhils","id":1019198,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMTkxOTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1019198?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils","html_url":"https://github.com/mhils","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/issues/3080/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/issues/3080/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
