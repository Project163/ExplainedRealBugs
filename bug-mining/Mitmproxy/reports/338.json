Install Chrome 68\r\n2. Start mitmproxy, add mitmproxy-ca to your cert-store\r\n3. Open any site via https\r\n4. Chrome shows NET::ERR_CERT_VALIDITY_TOO_LONG error\r\n\r\n\r\n##### Any other comments? What have you tried so far?\r\nIn #815 the validity of the certificates was reduced to three years which was enough for Chrome's \"not valid longer than 39 month\". It seems like Chrome 68 changed this to a shorter value though I haven't found any evidence in the code yet.\r\nAfter tinkering around I found that the value \"71107200\" (around 27 month) for DEFAULT_EXP is the greatest value that is accepted by Chrome.\r\n\r\nI know that I'm not using the most recent version of mitmproxy but the value for DEFAULT_EXP is the same in the current version so I assume the problem is still the same.\r\n\r\nSuggesting to just reduce the validity to something really short, like Let's Encrypt's three month. Should not be a problem and saves us from further reduction in Chrome.\r\n\r\n##### System information\r\n-> % mitmproxy --version\r\nMitmproxy: 3.0.3 \r\nPython:    3.6.6\r\nOpenSSL:   OpenSSL 1.1.0h  27 Mar 2018\r\nPlatform:  Linux-4.17.8-1-ARCH-x86_64-with-arch","closed_by":{"login":"mhils","id":1019198,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMTkxOTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1019198?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils","html_url":"https://github.com/mhils","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/issues/3273/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/issues/3273/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
