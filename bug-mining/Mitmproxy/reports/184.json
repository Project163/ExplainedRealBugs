Steps to reproduce the problem:\n1. Type command \"mitmdump -w temp\" in console and then visit a HTTP website.\n2. Close capture.\n3. Execute \"mitmdump -S temp\" to replay.\n##### What is the expected behavior?\n\nServer-side replay should be performed.\n##### What went wrong?\n\nmitmdump hangs, no anything print out and also no crash.\n##### Any other comments? What have you tried so far?\n\nmitmdump have an alert like below, but I think it is not related to server side replay.\nI searched this issue but nothing found, seems no one report this issue before. I appreciate if you can give me any advice. \n\nlester@ubuntu:mitm$ mitmdump -S ./temp\nALPN support missing (OpenSSL 1.0.2+ required)!\nHTTP/2 is disabled.
