judge. :-)\r\n\r\nAfter looking around a bit, your proposal of returning text instead of bytes seems to be the way to go (see: http://stackoverflow.com/a/4073451/934719). While we could implement our own parse_qsl that just works on bytes, browsers apparently always use mutipart/form-data for binary files (see linked SO page), so text is the more elegant API anyway. If you want to send a PR that changes the default behaviour, briefly notes this in the doc string and dass a quick test, I'd be happy to merge that right away! :smiley:\r\n\r\nMinor nitpick: If you send a PR: please use `self.content.decode()` instead of `str(self.content)` - that makes clear that there always is a strict ascii decode operation.\r\n\r\nThanks

tried to configure mitmproxy in upstream proxy mode to Charles(4.2) as was described [here](https://github.com/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/issues/313)\r\n\r\nIn my case there is the following scheme:\r\n\r\nClient(Roku)<---https/http--->MITMproxy<----HTTP/HTTPS---> Charles\r\n\r\nI  trusted the root CA cert in my keychain and even imported mitmproxy-ca-cert.p12 into Charles\r\nIf I run mitmproxy -T --host(in the transparent mode) without redirecting the request to Charles I'm able to view both http/https requests\r\nIf I send requests directly to Charles(\"Enable transparent HTTP proxying\" option is enabled) I can view HTTP traffic\r\n\r\nThe reason why I'm trying to put mitmproxy in the middle between my Roku device and Charles is to handle HTTPS traffic as well\r\n\r\nWhen I start mitmproxy in the upstream mode(mitmproxy -U \"http://localhost:8888\") and forward all the requests to Charles(\"Enable transparent HTTP proxying\" option is disabled) the Roku application simply crushes \r\nIn the even log I found - HTTP protocol error in client request: Invalid HTTP request form (expected: authority or absolute, got: relative)\r\nIn the Charles Contents tab - com.xk72.proxy.http.HttpFieldsException: Invalid first line in request\r\n\r\nCould you please advise if I can catch/handle HTTP/HTTPS traffic in the way described above?\r\n\r\n./mitmproxy
