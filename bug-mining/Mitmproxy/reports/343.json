Start `mitmproxy`.\r\n2. Run a request through it and observe that the `Date` header of the response is correct:\r\n\r\n       $ curl -six http://localhost:8080 http://httpbin.org/status/200 | grep Date:\r\n       Date: Thu, 21 Mar 2019 12:45:00 GMT\r\n\r\n3. In mitmproxy, start server replay:\r\n\r\n       : replay.server @all\r\n       \r\n4. Run a request again and observe that the `Date` header now has `-0000` instead of `GMT`:\r\n\r\n       $ curl -six http://localhost:8080 http://httpbin.org/status/200 | grep Date:\r\n       Date: Thu, 21 Mar 2019 12:46:58 -0000\r\n\r\n\r\n##### Any other comments? What have you tried so far?\r\n\r\nPer [RFC 7231 § 7.1.1](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231#section-7.1.1), a correct HTTP date always has `GMT`.\r\n\r\n\r\n##### System information\r\n\r\n    Mitmproxy: 4.0.4 binary\r\n    Python:    3.6.3\r\n    OpenSSL:   OpenSSL 1.1.0h  27 Mar 2018\r\n    Platform:  Linux-4.15.0-46-generic-x86_64-with-debian-buster-sid\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"mhils","id":1019198,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMTkxOTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1019198?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils","html_url":"https://github.com/mhils","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/issues/3502/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/issues/3502/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
