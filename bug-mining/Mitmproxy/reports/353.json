I'm not sure what exactly is happening, it seems to be related to HTTP 2? See the attached video. Sorry for the video being such a hot mess. During recording it didn't happen after the first navigation (of course, why would it) and it took a moment to be reproducible. When I opened the image in a new tab it still didn't load. The second time I [alt+enter]ed it into a new tab.\r\n\r\nIn dev tools the requests appear as `(pending)`. So mitmproxy never tells Chrome that the request failed?\r\n\r\n![Selection_561](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/679144/72176316-69dbf300-33de-11ea-80e2-09fe60047eb7.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Steps to reproduce the behavior:\r\n1. Start `mitmdump`\r\n2. Open Chromium\r\n3. Browse to www.youtube.com\r\n4. Click on a video\r\n5. Go back to the front page by clicking on the logo\r\n6. Most thumbnails will not load (you might need to repeat 4+5). I assume it is related to the error in the title. No amount of waiting makes them load.\r\n\r\nNow the question is: is YouTube or Chromium doing something funny or is it mitmproxy that has the issue?\r\n\r\n#### System Information\r\n\r\n```\r\nMitmproxy: 5.0.1\r\nPython:    3.7.5\r\nOpenSSL:   OpenSSL 1.1.0j  20 Nov 2018\r\nPlatform:  Linux-5.3.0-26-generic-x86_64-with-Ubuntu-19.10-eoan\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Attachments\r\nvideo: http://www.prinzhorn.me/mitmproxy/screencast.mp4\r\nvideo of me hovering the thumbnails: http://www.prinzhorn.me/mitmproxy/screencast-hover.mp4\r\ndump: http://www.prinzhorn.me/mitmproxy/youtube\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"Kriechi","id":114300,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNDMwMA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/114300?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kriechi","html_url":"https://github.com/Kriechi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kriechi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kriechi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kriechi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kriechi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kriechi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kriechi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kriechi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kriechi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kriechi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/issues/3780/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/issues/3780/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
