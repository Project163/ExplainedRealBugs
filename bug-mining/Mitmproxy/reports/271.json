We use paths in many options, and we'd like to handle them specially in user interfaces (so we can, for instance, do path completion on tab). \r\n\r\nWe should teach optmanager to know about a Path type, which is treated just like a string. Ergonomically, I'd like user to still be able to say ```options.path = \"value\"``` rather than have to say ```options.path = types.Path(\"value\")```, so it would be good to automatically handle type promotion.
