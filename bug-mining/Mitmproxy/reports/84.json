Does something exist outside mitmproxy that allows one to modify these files?\n2. Would you guys be interested in a feature that allows you to modify data as it streams?\n\nI think this use case is particularly interesting when the user it downloading a large executable file, a song, a movie, or even a compressed file with any of those.\n\nFor an example of what I'm talking about, I have a proof of concept in c that injects code into a file in a streaming way: https://github.com/vikstrous/binder_full_of_elves/blob/master/stream_bind.c (linux x86-64 LE only for now)\n\nI'm particularly excited about injecting into streaming video :)\n\nI understand that mitmproxy was not designed for this, but I think it would be a great feature and I'm interested in contributing to make this happen.\n","closed_by":{"login":"mhils","id":1019198,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMTkxOTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1019198?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils","html_url":"https://github.com/mhils","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/issues/319/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/issues/319/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
