Access a Flow object in handle_response or handle_request\n2. Print source_address property from the Flow's server_conn (ServerConnection object)\n##### What is the expected behavior?\n\nShould see a display of tcp.Address when ServerConnection is not None and only ('', 0) when ServerConnection is None.\n##### What went wrong?\n\nOnly shows ('', 0) even when a valid ServerConnection is not None\n##### Any other comments?\n\nThis does not seem to be affecting ClientConnection.address at all.\n\n---\n\nmitmproxy version: 0.16\nOperating System: OS X 10.10.5\n","closed_by":{"login":"mhils","id":1019198,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMTkxOTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1019198?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils","html_url":"https://github.com/mhils","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/issues/956/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/issues/956/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
