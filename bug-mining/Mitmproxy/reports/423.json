While getting it to work I stumbled over the problem that some sites fail to load with: \r\n\r\n```\r\nHTTP/2 connection closed: <ConnectionTerminated error_code:ErrorCodes.FRAME_SIZE_ERROR, last_stream_id:1, additional_data:None>\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe issue is that the callable `flow.request.stream` and `flow.response.stream` at the end of the stream is supposed to return the zero byte string it receives which is then sent as an HTTP/2 chunk. For responses this may be tolerated by the client but for requests it breaks protocol.\r\n\r\nI fixed this issue with this patch which I _think_ is probably the best way to fix it given the contract with the callable:\r\n\r\n```diff\r\ndiff --git a/mitmproxy/proxy/layers/http/__init__.py b/mitmproxy/proxy/layers/http/__init__.py\r\nindex 0b134f7bb..9068e9020 100644\r\n--- a/mitmproxy/proxy/layers/http/__init__.py\r\n+++ b/mitmproxy/proxy/layers/http/__init__.py\r\n@@ -244,10 +244,14 @@ class HttpStream(layer.Layer):\r\n         elif isinstance(event, RequestEndOfMessage):\r\n             if callable(self.flow.request.stream):\r\n                 chunks = self.flow.request.stream(b\"\")\r\n+                send = True\r\n                 if isinstance(chunks, bytes):\r\n+                    if len(chunks) == 0:\r\n+                        send = False\r\n                     chunks = [chunks]\r\n-                for chunk in chunks:\r\n-                    yield SendHttp(RequestData(self.stream_id, chunk), self.context.server)\r\n+                if send:\r\n+                    for chunk in chunks:\r\n+                        yield SendHttp(RequestData(self.stream_id, chunk), self.context.server)\r\n \r\n             self.flow.request.timestamp_end = time.time()\r\n             yield HttpRequestHook(self.flow)\r\n@@ -336,10 +340,14 @@ class HttpStream(layer.Layer):\r\n         elif isinstance(event, ResponseEndOfMessage):\r\n             if callable(self.flow.response.stream):\r\n                 chunks = self.flow.response.stream(b\"\")\r\n+                send = True\r\n                 if isinstance(chunks, bytes):\r\n+                    if len(chunks) == 0:\r\n+                        send = False\r\n                     chunks = [chunks]\r\n-                for chunk in chunks:\r\n-                    yield SendHttp(ResponseData(self.stream_id, chunk), self.context.client)\r\n+                if send:\r\n+                    for chunk in chunks:\r\n+                        yield SendHttp(ResponseData(self.stream_id, chunk), self.context.client)\r\n             yield from self.send_response(already_streamed=True)\r\n \r\n     @expect(ResponseData, ResponseTrailers, ResponseEndOfMessage)\r\n```","closed_by":{"login":"mhils","id":1019198,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMTkxOTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1019198?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils","html_url":"https://github.com/mhils","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/issues/5077/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/issues/5077/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
