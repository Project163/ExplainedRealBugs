Create a file `/tmp/example.py` with the following text:\r\n```python\r\nimport typing\r\nfrom mitmproxy import ctx\r\n\r\nclass Example:\r\n\r\n    def load(self, loader):\r\n        loader.add_option(name='myoption', typespec=typing.Sequence[str],\r\n                          default=[], help='')\r\n\r\n    def response(self, flow):\r\n        ctx.log.info(repr(ctx.options.myoption))\r\n\r\naddons = [Example()]\r\n```\r\n2. Run `mitmdump -s /tmp/example.py --set myoption=foo --set myoption=bar`\r\n3. Run a request through it: `curl -sx http://localhost:8080 http://httpbin.org/get`\r\n4. Observe that `['bar']` is printed, meaning that `myoption` is set to a sequence of one element — the last one passed on the command line, with the first one ignored.\r\n\r\n\r\n##### Any other comments?
