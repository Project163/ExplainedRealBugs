If that's the case don't hesitate to close this issue, I appreciate it's a bit of a weird thing to do.\n\nIt would appear that when mitmproxy is run with the `--stream 0` flag and a script chooses to send an `HTTPResponse` object with static content mitmproxy crashes.\n##### Steps to reproduce the problem:\n1. Run `mitmdump --stream 0 -s examples/redirect_requests.py`\n2. Attempt to access http://example.com/ through mitmproxy.\n##### What is the expected behavior?\n\n\"helloworld\" should be displayed in the browser.\n##### What went wrong?\n\nmitmproxy crashes with this traceback:\n\n```\n127.0.0.1:40469: Traceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/mitmproxy/proxy/server.py\", line 121, in handle\n    root_layer()\n  File \"/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/mitmproxy/proxy/modes/http_proxy.py\", line 11, in __call__\n    layer()\n  File \"/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/mitmproxy/protocol/tls.py\", line 358, in __call__\n    layer()\n  File \"/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/mitmproxy/protocol/http1.py\", line 67, in __call__\n    layer()\n  File \"/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/mitmproxy/protocol/http.py\", line 204, in __call__\n    self.send_response_to_client(flow)\n  File \"/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/mitmproxy/protocol/http.py\", line 285, in send_response_to_client\n    self.send_response_body(flow.response, chunks)\n  File \"/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/mitmproxy/protocol/http1.py\", line 42, in send_response_body\n    for chunk in http1.assemble_body(response.headers, chunks):\n  File \"/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/netlib/http/http1/assemble.py\", line 42, in assemble_body\n    for chunk in body_chunks:\n  File \"/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/netlib/http/http1/read.py\", line 133, in read_body\n    content = rfile.read(chunk_size)\nAttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'read'\n```\n##### Any other comments?\n\nThanks for developing this amazing piece of software. It's incredibly useful.\n\n---\n\nMitmproxy Version: 0.17\nOperating System: Linux\n","closed_by":{"login":"mhils","id":1019198,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMTkxOTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1019198?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils","html_url":"https://github.com/mhils","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/issues/1115/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/issues/1115/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
