PR fixes #4630. Thanks again for the helpful log, @Nerixyz!\r\n\r\nThis actually was a really fascinating bug. In short, the following things happened:\r\n\r\n1. We have a client that is not sending a TLS ALPN extension.\r\n2. During the client's TLS handshake, we establish a server connection to fetch the server cert (with connection_strategy=lazy, we would just guess what needs to be in the cert and not connect here yet). We know that we eventually want client TLS (`client.tls` is already true), but at this point `client.tls_established` is still false as we haven't finished the handshake yet.\r\n3. In `tlsconfig.py#L175`, we mistakenly believe that there is no client TLS, so we decide to send HTTP ALPNs upstream.\r\n4. We successfully negotiate HTTP/2 upstream. The Facebook server immediately sends its HTTP/2 settings frame.\r\n5. We try to detect the application-level protocol in `addons/next_layer.py`: https://github.com/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/blob/de0951462d5919c6d37bed5f8f3b80d8f810b833/mitmproxy/addons/next_layer.py#L152-L157\r\n6. At this point we haven't received the request from the client yet, but we already have the server's HTTP/2 settings in `client_data`. Mitmproxy concludes that this is a non-HTTP protocol with a server-side greeting.\r\n7. The HTTP/1 client tries to talk to the HTTP/2 server over plain TCP. Everything explodes. 💣
