Start mitmproxy with no arguments. Proxy will listen on port 8080 of all interfaces.\r\n    ```\r\n    $ netstat -na | grep 8080\r\n    tcp          0      0  *.8080                 *.*                    LISTEN\r\n    ```\r\n2. Make a request through the proxy. Example: `http_proxy=\"http://127.0.0.1:8080\" curl -v http://www.example.org`. A response is received.\r\n3. Modify or just resend the request in mitmproxy (key `r`). A new response is received, and everything works correctly.\r\n\r\nExample that fails:\r\n\r\n1. Start mitmproxy binding only to the local interface: `mitmproxy --listen-host 127.0.0.1`\r\n   ```\r\n    $ netstat -na | grep 8080\r\n    tcp          0      0  127.0.0.1.8080         *.*                    LISTEN\r\n    ```\r\n2. Make a request through the proxy, as before. A response is received.\r\n3. Modify or just resend the request in mitmproxy (key `r`). **Now the request fails after a while (some timeout?) with an error**. At least one of the errors is `Error connecting to \"www.example.org\": [Errno -5] no address associated with name`.\r\n\r\nVersion tested:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ mitmproxy --version\r\nMitmproxy: 3.0.0dev0967 (5067438e) \r\nPython:    3.6.0\r\nOpenSSL:   LibreSSL 2.5.3\r\nPlatform:  OpenBSD-6.1-amd64-64bit\r\n```","closed_by":{"login":"cortesi","id":22544,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNTQ0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22544?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cortesi","html_url":"https://github.com/cortesi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cortesi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cortesi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cortesi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cortesi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cortesi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cortesi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cortesi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cortesi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cortesi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/issues/2647/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/issues/2647/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
