I think technically since the source file is inside mitmproxy it should be specified here -- though kataistruct probably also uses pkg_resources as well\r\n\r\nYeah, we are in murky waters here. The Kaitai compiler auto-generates this file, so everyone who uses `kaitaistruct` will also depend on `pkg_resources`. This is not mentioned on http://doc.kaitai.io/lang_python.html, which does mention `enum34`. \r\n\r\nMy understanding is that in an ideal world, 1) Kaitai's compiler would generate code that uses `importlib.metadata`, 2) Kaitai's runtime would specify a conditional dependency on `importlib-metadata` for Python <= 3.7. I don't think you can use kaitai's runtime in any other way without this. Specifying the dependency directly there would mean that kaitai users don't have to deal with it individually. Would you agree with that assessment?\r\n\r\nWhatsoever, happy to merge your PR so that we this fixed on our end. Ideally we could add a reference to a Kaitai issue right away so that we can eventually remove

generated Python parsers currently depend on `pkg_resources`, which is not specified as a dependency of `kaitaistruct`. This problem isn't very visible as most environments still have setuptools around (which includes `pkg_resources`), but if setuptools is not around in the current virtualenv, importing parsers crashes with an `ImportError`.\r\n\r\n\r\nOne could argue that Kaitai's behavior is technically correct: The actual import is done in the downstream codebase -- in the Python file generated by `ksc` -- and not within the `kaitaistruct` package. However, all generated Kaitai parsers have this dependency, and it seems relatively stupid and brittle to have every single Kaitai user add an additional dependency for `pkg_resources` themselves. Long story short, I think `kaitaistruct` should have packages that are required by all ksc-generated parsers to its own dependency list.\r\n\r\nWith this aside, @asottile (who initially reported this to us in @mitmproxy) made the very helpful suggestion in https://github.com/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/issues/4918#issuecomment-974456344 that the generated parser should ideally just use `importlib.metadata` from stdlib instead of dependening on `pkg_resources`. Unfortunately `importlib.metadata` has only been added in Python 3.8, so just changing `ksc` is not enough. Long story short, I propose the following changes:\r\n\r\n1. Make the `kaitaistruct` PyPI package depend on the [`importlib-metadata`](https://pypi.org/project/importlib-metadata/) PyPI package for Python <3.8 (see https://setuptools.pypa.io/en/latest/userguide/dependency_management.html#platform-specific-dependencies). \r\nThis means no new (de facto less) dependencies for anyone on a recent Python version.\r\n2. Once a new `kaitaistruct` version is released on PyPI that includes these changes, update `ksc` to emit parsers that use `importlib.metadata`  instead of `pkg_resources`.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kaitai-io/kaitai_struct_python_runtime/issues/62/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kaitai-io/kaitai_struct_python_runtime/issues/62/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":5650070676,"node_id":"CE_lADOAAfumM4_HX8WzwAAAAFQxTyU","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/issues/events/5650070676","actor":{"login":"mhils","id":1019198,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMTkxOTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1019198?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils","html_url":"https://github.com/mhils","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-11-21T14:14:47Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":5650070714,"node_id":"REFE_lADOAAfumM4_HX8WzwAAAAFQxTy6","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/issues/events/5650070714","actor":{"login":"mhils","id":1019198,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMTkxOTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1019198?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils","html_url":"https://github.com/mhils","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"3847842f731c8e1c5a5990ef5c73897e4ab91028","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/commits/3847842f731c8e1c5a5990ef5c73897e4ab91028","created_at":"2021-11-21T14:14:49Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
