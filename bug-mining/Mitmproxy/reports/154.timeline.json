Steps to reproduce the problem:\r\n\r\n1. I captured some traffic, and ran the following to filter it:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ mitmdump -r traffic.mitm -w out.mitm '~u main.css'\r\nProxy server listening at http://[::]:8080\r\n172.16.122.1:51049: GET https://www.sjoerdlangkemper.nl/css/main.css\r\n                 << 304 Not Modified 0b\r\n$\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt displays only the matched URL, but it saves all traffic. When done, out.mitm contains the same requests and responses as traffic.mitm. I.e. `mitmproxy -r out.mitm` shows a lot of requests, where I would expect only the request for main.css.\r\n\r\n\r\n##### Any other comments? What have you tried so far?\r\n\r\nI tried this with release 2.0.2, and there it worked as expected. This issue seems to be similar to #1089.\r\n\r\n##### System information\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ mitmdump --version\r\nMitmproxy version: 3.0.0 (2.0.0dev0965-0x168c72a) \r\nPython version: 3.5.2\r\nPlatform: Linux-4.4.0-98-generic-x86_64-with-Ubuntu-16.04-xenial\r\nSSL version: OpenSSL 1.1.0f  25 May 2017\r\nLinux distro: Ubuntu 16.04 xenial\r\n```\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/issues/2635/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/issues/2635/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
