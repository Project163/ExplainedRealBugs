I feel your pain - we currently have a [very aggressive policy](https://github.com/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/blob/57cd9022d9253c7873ff3bd1d7943296bdf90268/libmproxy/flow.py#L1115-L1119) in place when it comes to deprecation. However, the serialized format didn't really change that much between the latest releases and we absolutely don't want users to stay on old releases.\n\nI wrote a [small tool](https://gist.github.com/mhils/c69c599a40c61b596c7a) that converts 0.9 flows to 0.13 flows for a specific use case a while ago, but didn't get around implementing it properly in mitmproxy. If you look at the script, you'll see that's is actually not that much magic. I'd love to see someone taking this further and integrating it into mitmproxy. If you are interested, just ping me on Slack and I'm happy to help.
