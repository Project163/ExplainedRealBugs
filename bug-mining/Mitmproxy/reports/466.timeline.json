Problem Description\r\n\r\nI've been recently trying to add a `block_list` rule which implements \"if request has header XYZ then return status code 500\" behaviour. It didn't work as expected despite of the fact exactly the same filter expression did work in other built-in addons (e.g. `modify_headers`).\r\n\r\nI started searching GH issues and stumbled upon #6329. It revealed that `|~hq X-Custom:\\\\sfoo|500` is effectively treated as `|~hq x-custom:\\\\sfoo|500` because of `.lower()` call [here](https://github.com/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/blob/v11.0.2/mitmproxy/addons/blocklist.py#L27). I find this controversial because:\r\n\r\n- even though HTTP header names should be treated as case-insensitive according to an RFC, header values certainly don't follow that rule\r\n- filter expression are quite rich and current `block_list` behaviour makes certain implementations impossible, e.g. block request when its body contains `FOO`, but not `foo` or when `Cookie` header contains `BAR=1`, but not `bar=1`\r\n- aforementioned ticket resulted in #6493 which globally turned `~u` filter into a case-insensitive regex. That change had far-reaching consequences - right now if you'd like to attach some logic to `/process/ME/please.html` requests, while leaving `/process/me/please.html` unaffected, it's simply not possible using built-in addons\r\n\r\n## Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\n1. Put the following in `~/.mitmproxy/config.yaml` file:\r\n```yaml\r\nblock_list:\r\n  - \"|~hq X-Custom:\\\\sfoo|500\"\r\nmodify_headers:\r\n  - \"|~hq X-Custom:\\\\sfoo|x-custom-matched|true\"\r\n  - \"|~u /process/ME/please\\\\.html$|x-url-matched|true\"\r\nflow_detail: 2\r\n```\r\n2. Start `mitmdump` with: `mitmdump --mode reverse:https://httpbingo.org -p 8443` command\r\n3. Request some content via `mitmdump` instance:\r\n\r\n### `https://` + HTTP/1.1 + `X-Custom: foo` header\r\n\r\n```\r\n# -------------------------------------------------------------\r\n# Expected: 500 + \"x-custom-matched: true\" response header\r\n# Got: 200 + \"x-custom-matched: true\"\r\n# -------------------------------------------------------------\r\n$ curl -k https://localhost:8443/headers -SsD - -o /dev/null -H \"X-Custom: foo\" --http1.1\r\nHTTP/1.1 200 OK\r\naccess-control-allow-credentials: true\r\naccess-control-allow-origin: *\r\ncontent-type: application/json; charset=utf-8\r\ndate: Mon, 06 Jan 2025 22:31:41 GMT\r\ncontent-length: 535\r\nserver: Fly/d5165e6e2 (2024-12-18)\r\nvia: 1.1 fly.io\r\nfly-request-id: 01JGYVXJ3W2ZQ5R0NZ61X7XJ77-arn\r\nx-custom-matched: true\r\n```\r\n\r\n### `https://` + HTTP/2 + `X-Custom: foo` header\r\n\r\nEverything's the same except HTTP/2.

Don't treat `~u` as case-insensitive (or add an option to switch to case-**sensitive** matching)\r\n\r\n## Noteworthy facts\r\n\r\n1. A switch from HTTP/1.1 to HTTP/2 results in a totally different response (`200` vs `500`)\r\n2. A custom addon can be used as a fallback to circumvent these issues, but it sort of defeats the purpose of built-in addons\r\n3. `mitmdump` output: https://gist.github.com/jwadolowski/c525d4b36d973b97cfb857414f1d7d78\r\n\r\n## System Information\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ mitmproxy --version\r\nMitmproxy: 11.0.2 binary\r\nPython:    3.12.7\r\nOpenSSL:   OpenSSL 3.4.0 22 Oct 2024\r\nPlatform:  macOS-15.2-arm64-arm-64bit\r\n```\r\n\r\nPS.
