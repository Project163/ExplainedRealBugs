new Wireguard mode enables practically arbitrary TCP/UDP interception, and is sufficiently powerful that we probably do want new functionality to enable new use cases. In principle, it would be nice to have mitmproxy record literally every flow that is coming through (kind of like wireshark), including TLS handshake errors.\r\n\r\nIn general, for live requests there are actually three distinct actions that could be subject to filtering:\r\n\r\n- TLS interception: intercepting and decrypting TLS traffic; disabled by `ignore_hosts` but enabled by `tcp_hosts`\r\n- Higher-level protocol layers: parsing HTTP, etc. and invoking higher-level protocol processing; disabled by `ignore_hosts` and by `tcp_hosts`\r\n- Flow recording: keeping track of a flow in memory for viewing, hooking, saving; disabled by `ignore_hosts` but enabled by `tcp_hosts`\r\n\r\nI can imagine use-cases for separating these things: disabling TLS interception for a host but leaving recording enabled is a useful way to snoop on traffic purely passively, to be able to see things like TLS fingerprints and SNI information; specifically disabling higher-level protocols is useful to disable HTTP parsing for non-HTTP flows (e.g. SIP) or when you don't actually care about parsing even an unencrypted HTTP connection (right now `allow_hosts` will still record plaintext HTTP even from non-allowed hosts), and so on.","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/issues/comments/1801965715/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"nneonneo","id":75449,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc1NDQ5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/75449?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nneonneo","html_url":"https://github.com/nneonneo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nneonneo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nneonneo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nneonneo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nneonneo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nneonneo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nneonneo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nneonneo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nneonneo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nneonneo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/issues/comments/1801973856","html_url":"https://github.com/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/issues/6421#issuecomment-1801973856","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/issues/6421","id":1801973856,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAAfumM5rZ_Bg","user":{"login":"nneonneo","id":75449,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc1NDQ5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/75449?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nneonneo","html_url":"https://github.com/nneonneo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nneonneo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nneonneo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nneonneo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nneonneo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nneonneo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nneonneo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nneonneo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nneonneo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nneonneo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-11-08T14:14:29Z","updated_at":"2023-11-08T14:14:29Z","body":"As

Problem Description\r\n\r\nMore and more mobile apps use certificate pinning on connections which let the connection fail in the TLS handshake phase on client side. Those connection attempts are currently only logged, however in my opinion it should be recorded similar to successful connections so that they were included when the recorded traffic is saved to a file, as the app tried to establish a connection with a server it most likely just failed because of mitmproxy.\r\n\r\n#### Proposal\r\nTLS client handshake failed errors should be recorded as flow so that they can be saved to the mitmproxy dump file.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/issues/6861/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/issues/6861/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":14355462225,"node_id":"REFE_lADOAAfumM51H-h8zwAAAANXpvhR","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/issues/events/14355462225","actor":{"login":"NicolaiSoeborg","id":8722223,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg3MjIyMjM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8722223?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/NicolaiSoeborg","html_url":"https://github.com/NicolaiSoeborg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NicolaiSoeborg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NicolaiSoeborg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NicolaiSoeborg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NicolaiSoeborg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NicolaiSoeborg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NicolaiSoeborg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NicolaiSoeborg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NicolaiSoeborg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NicolaiSoeborg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"d0a0b8608f089d87d1261147ab07b8a9f9161131","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/NicolaiSoeborg/mitmproxy/commits/d0a0b8608f089d87d1261147ab07b8a9f9161131","created_at":"2024-09-22T20:11:40Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":14475235266,"node_id":"CE_lADOAAfumM51H-h8zwAAAANeyo_C","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/issues/events/14475235266","actor":{"login":"mhils","id":1019198,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMTkxOTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1019198?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils","html_url":"https://github.com/mhils","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2024-10-01T15:28:30Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":14475235297,"node_id":"CE_lADOAAfumM51H-h8zwAAAANeyo_h","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/issues/events/14475235297","actor":{"login":"mhils","id":1019198,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMTkxOTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1019198?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils","html_url":"https://github.com/mhils","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":"a44191a9b19d703d1c25e89c3024a3e1fbbe6e60","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/commits/a44191a9b19d703d1c25e89c3024a3e1fbbe6e60","created_at":"2024-10-01T15:28:30Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":14477534717,"node_id":"REFE_lADOAAfumM51H-h8zwAAAANe7aX9","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/issues/events/14477534717","actor":{"login":"lups2000","id":100372313,"node_id":"U_kgDOBfuPWQ","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/100372313?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lups2000","html_url":"https://github.com/lups2000","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lups2000/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lups2000/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lups2000/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lups2000/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"htt
