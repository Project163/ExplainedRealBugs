(Sorry if this is my own mistake, I just started poking around with mitmproxy)\r\n1. Load the proxy with the scenario which is supposed to kill every websocket request with 50% chance\r\n```\r\nfrom mitmproxy import ctx, websocket\r\nimport random\r\n\r\n\r\ndef websocket_message(flow: websocket.WebSocketFlow) -> None:\r\n    ctx.log.info(flow.messages[-1].content.strip()[:20])\r\n    if random.random() < 50:\r\n        flow.kill()\r\n```\r\n2. Start the test which opens a websocket connection through the proxy and sends several binary chunks of data.\r\n=> Proxy crashes\r\n\r\n```\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n  File \"/Users/eugene/gitrepo/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/tools/console/master.py\", line 216, in run\r\n    self.loop.run()\r\n  File \"/Users/eugene/gitrepo/mitmproxy/venv/lib/python3.6/site-packages/urwid/main_loop.py\", line 278, in run\r\n    self._run()\r\n  File \"/Users/eugene/gitrepo/mitmproxy/venv/lib/python3.6/site-packages/urwid/main_loop.py\", line 376, in _run\r\n    self.event_loop.run()\r\n  File \"/Users/eugene/gitrepo/mitmproxy/venv/lib/python3.6/site-packages/urwid/main_loop.py\", line 682, in run\r\n    self._loop()\r\n  File \"/Users/eugene/gitrepo/mitmproxy/venv/lib/python3.6/site-packages/urwid/main_loop.py\", line 715, in _loop\r\n    alarm_callback()\r\n  File \"/Users/eugene/gitrepo/mitmproxy/venv/lib/python3.6/site-packages/urwid/main_loop.py\", line 164, in cb\r\n    callback(self, user_data)\r\n  File \"/Users/eugene/gitrepo/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/tools/console/master.py\", line 175, in ticker\r\n    changed = self.tick(timeout=0)\r\n  File \"/Users/eugene/gitrepo/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/master.py\", line 109, in tick\r\n    self.addons.handle_lifecycle(mtype, obj)\r\n  File \"/Users/eugene/gitrepo/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/addonmanager.py\", line 234, in handle_lifecycle\r\n    message.reply.take()\r\n  File \"/Users/eugene/gitrepo/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/controller.py\", line 88, in take\r\n    \"Reply is {}, but expected it to be start.\".format(self.state)\r\nmitmproxy.exceptions.ControlException: Reply is committed, but expected it to be start.\r\n\r\nmitmproxy has crashed!\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\nMitmproxy: 3.0.0dev1075 (a6a4b1c3) \r\nPython:    3.6.3\r\nOpenSSL:   OpenSSL 1.1.0g  2 Nov 2017\r\nPlatform:  Darwin-17.2.0-x86_64-i386-64bit\r\n```","closed_by":{"login":"mhils","id":1019198,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMTkxOTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1019198?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils","html_url":"https://github.com/mhils","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/issues/2724/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/issues/2724/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
