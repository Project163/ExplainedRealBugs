have found the cause the problem. It is around this part of the code:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/blob/326bb546da214eb2c3ca82f9c506f3c051b1e660/mitmproxy/net/http/cookies.py#L143-L165\r\n\r\n`lhs` and `rhs` are respectively variables to store the name and value of the cookie or the attribute. They are added to `pairs` in line 165. The code will interpret the first pair as the name and value of the cookie, and the remaining pairs are interpreted as attributes. As can be seen from the code, line 165 is only reached if `lhs` is not an empty string. Thus if we specify an empty string as the name of the cookie, weird behaviours will occur. In particular, if we leave both name and value of the cookie to be empty, then the 1st pair to be added is the name/value of the attribute, so they are \"pushed higher up\" to become the name/value of the cookie. Besides, if we just leave the name empty, while fill in something for the value of the cookie, mitmproxy will crash.\r\n\r\nSo the problem here is because of not validating the `Set-Cookie` header. I think when mitmproxy parse the `Set-Cookie` header (i.e. in `mitmproxy.net.http.cookies._read_set_cookie_pairs` quoted above), it should only parse valid header. If the `Set-Cookie` header is invalid and the user wants to edit it, mitmproxy should tell the user that the header is invalid and allows editing of the raw header instead of using the current grid editor.\r\n\r\nI will work on an implementation of this idea.","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/issues/comments/363917344/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"tran-tien-dat","id":8559368,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg1NTkzNjg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8559368?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tran-tien-dat","html_url":"https://github.com/tran-tien-dat","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tran-tien-dat/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tran-tien-dat/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tran-tien-dat/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tran-tien-dat/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tran-tien-dat/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tran-tien-dat/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tran-tien-dat/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tran-tien-dat/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tran-tien-dat/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":1468320069,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDE0NjgzMjAwNjk=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/issues/events/1468320069","actor":{"login":"tran-tien-dat","id":8559368,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg1NTkzNjg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8559368?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tran-tien-dat","html_url":"https://github.com/tran-tien-dat","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tran-tien-dat/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tran-tien-dat/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tran-tien-dat/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tran-tien-dat/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tran-tien-dat/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tran-tien-dat/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tran-tien-dat/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tran-tien-dat/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tran-tien-dat/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"edde595444b7f756c82ee40ae40c9399c36b7cbe","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tran-tien-dat/mitmproxy/commits/edde595444b7f756c82ee40ae40c9399c36b7cbe","created_at":"2018-02-11T07:02:35Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"actor":{"login":"tran-tien-dat","id":8559368,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg1NTkzNjg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8559368?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tran-tien-dat","html_url":"https://github.com/tran-tien-dat","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tran-tien-dat/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tran-tien-dat/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tran-tien-dat/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tran-tien-dat/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tran-tien-dat/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tran-tien-dat/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tran-tien-dat/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tran-tien-dat/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tran-tien-dat/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-02-11T07:16:12Z","updated_at":"2018-02-11T07:16:12Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/issues/2859","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mitmproxy/mitmproxy","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/issues/2859/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/issues/2859/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/issues/2859/events","html_url":"https://github.com/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/pull/2859","id":296168061,"node_id":"MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0MTY4NDQwNDc3","number":2859,"title":"Allow

having empty cookie key and value will lead to weird behaviour, as mentioned in #2829. Additionally, having cookie value without a key will crash the program when trying to edit the cookie header.\r\n\r\nInitially, I thought we should reject malformed `Cookie` or `Set-Cookie` header and allow the user to edit the raw header instead. However, `cookies.py` says we are trying to be as permissive as possible, accepting even malformed header. Hence, I think `=;a=b`, `=bc` should all be accepted, as they can be interpreted as having empty cookie key (and value). The only thing that should return an empty array is something like `;` or the empty string, which will be parsed as `(lhs, rhs) == ('', None)`. That is the change I have made in this PR.\r\n\r\nThis is my first PR, so please let me know if I miss out on anything.

when mitmproxy parses a Set-Cookie header with no cookie key and value but some attributes, the attribute will be interpreted as the cookie key and value (#2829). This PR fixes the problem by recognizing any string with the character `=` as a valid key/value pair. This also means that, even the attributes can be an empty key/value pair. Of course, this won't happen in legitimate HTTP responses, but the change is in the spirit of being as permissive as possible so we should accept any string that can be interpreted by human.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/issues/2886/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/issues/2886/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":1490004296,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MTQ5MDAwNDI5Ng==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/issues/events/1490004296","actor":{"login":"cortesi","id":22544,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNTQ0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22544?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cortesi","html_url":"https://github.com/cortesi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cortesi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cortesi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cortesi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cortesi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cortesi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cortesi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cortesi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cortesi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cortesi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":"97e534e76b189176bf704098673f33079f68b14a","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/commits/97e534e76b189176bf704098673f33079f68b14a","created_at":"2018-02-23T21:49:36Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":1490004306,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDE0OTAwMDQzMDY=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/issues/events/1490004306","actor":{"login":"cortesi","id":22544,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNTQ0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22544?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cortesi","html_url":"https://github.com/cortesi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cortesi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cortesi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cortesi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cortesi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cortesi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cortesi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cortesi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cortesi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cortesi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"16dd7f3ddf012426f2ddcb5792cf35be528c6e09","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/commits/16dd7f3ddf012426f2ddcb5792cf35be528c6e09","created_at":"2018-02-23T21:49:36Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
