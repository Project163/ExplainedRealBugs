Per documentation \"Proxy Authentication\r\nAsks the user for authentication before they are permitted to use the proxy. Authentication headers are stripped from the flows, so they are not passed to upstream servers. For now, only HTTP Basic authentication is supported. The proxy auth options are not compatible with the transparent, socks or reverse proxy mode.\"\r\n\r\n#### Proposal\r\nProxy authentication for reverse proxy mode.\r\n\r\n#### Alternatives\r\nA clear and concise description of any alternative solutions or features you've considered.\r\n\r\n#### Additional context\r\nAdd any other context or screenshots about the proposal here.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"mhils","id":1019198,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMTkxOTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1019198?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils","html_url":"https://github.com/mhils","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/issues/4473/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/issues/4473/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
