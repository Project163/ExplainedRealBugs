We usually add the SNI value provided by the client to the fake certificate to make situations like these work (see [libmproxy/protocol/tls.py#L496](https://github.com/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/blob/6b92497d4f1d9fc0a98c42f66ab2bf81e8fa2fc7/libmproxy/protocol/tls.py#L496)).

take. Not parsing the ClientHello properly is still something we want to fix, but I don't think this solves your issue. I assume this problem affects a specific app? A workaround would be adding a second mitmproxy instance in reverse proxy mode in front of the target server. mitmproxy should include the reverse proxy destination in the cert and the existing mitm instance will mirror it.\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/issues/comments/160194365/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"mhils","id":1019198,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMTkxOTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1019198?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils","html_url":"https://github.com/mhils","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/issues/comments/160195570","html_url":"https://github.com/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/issues/847#issuecomment-160195570","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/issues/847","id":160195570,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE2MDE5NTU3MA==","user":{"login":"mhils","id":1019198,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMTkxOTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1019198?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils","html_url":"https://github.com/mhils","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-11-27T19:51:00Z","updated_at":"2015-11-27T19:54:00Z","body":"Note
