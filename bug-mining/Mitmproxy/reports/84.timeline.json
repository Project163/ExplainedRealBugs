I'd redefine flow.response.stream to be either a boolean value _or a callable_, that transforms the chunks, e.g. take the following mitmproxy inline script:\n\n``` python\ndef modify(chunks):\n    \"\"\"\n    chunks is a generator that can be used to iterate over all chunks.\n    Each chunk is a (prefix, content, suffix) tuple. \n    For example, in the case of chunked transfer encoding: (\"3\\r\\n\",\"foo\",\"\\r\\n\")\n    \"\"\"\n    for prefix, content, suffix in chunks:\n        yield prefix, content.replace(\"foo\",\"bar\"), suffix\ndef responseheaders(ctx, flow):\n    flow.response.stream = modify\n```\n\nIf we do it this way, implementation is fairly easy:\n- [x] wrap `http.read_http_body_chunked` with `flow.response.stream` if the `stream` attribute is `callable()` at https://github.com/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/blob/e9401a2123f416f8dd4c24bb4bbc74f297369133/libmproxy/protocol/http.py#L952\n- [x] Add test\n- [x] Update docs\n\nLet me know if you have any further questions. I'd love to see a PR for this! :smile:
