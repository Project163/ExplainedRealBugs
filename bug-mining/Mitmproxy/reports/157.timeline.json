It has since been discovered that MSIE 3.0x doesn’t follow the character rules outlined in those specs and also many current day browsers and servers have relaxed parsing rules when comes to Cookie handling. As a result, the parsing rules used are a bit less strict.\n> \n> The character set, string.ascii_letters, string.digits and !#$%&'*+-.^_`|~: denote the set of valid characters allowed by this module in Cookie name (as key).\n\nSo fixing this or handling gracefully might be tricky - without shipping our own cookie parsing lib.\nAnd just removing the cookie (i.e. gracefully ignoring it) might lead to confusing results and creates more harm than good.
