I have a bit of problem, I would like to take this feature a step further; but first let me establish to you my background in using this feature. Please bear in mind that I am new to mitmproxy.\n\nI am currently successfully performing a transparent TCP SSL mitm session with a client cert. I want to record the decrypted stream as direct binary. handshaking info is good auxiliary debug info, but ultimately I want a sole dump of only the decrypted ssl conversation. Not knowing how to do this directly in mitmproxy, I instead had mitmproxy output a pre master secret file which I configured Wireshark to use. this method was successful until I realized that I am suffering from packet loss due to the high volume high frequency of packets... I did try playing around with Wireshark settings, but it is too clear to me that if I only knew how to get mitmproxy to simply share the decrypted information with me in the style I prefer,I would be golden. This is because mitmproxy is in the direct path of the packets, unlike Wireshark, which is only an observer.\n\nSo, I ask one of you to please educate me on two points. Can mitmproxy/mitmdump already do what I seek? If so, please provide some detail in enabling the functionality. If it is not yet available, but you know what file(s) or function(s) are the key locations to modify with additional logging functionality, please let me know.

I have discovered several things, some spawning further questions.\n- I am using `--raw-tcp` instead of `--tcp` -- and I've become curious whether one is preferred over the other. `--raw-tcp` works for my situation, but given the description of `--tcp` here, it sounds like it would also perform the exact same duties (SSL Mitm w/ decryption). Please correct me if I'm wrong.\n- I discovered how to have mitmproxy dump the decrypted SSL conversation to file (in the context of --raw-tcp).. Since my experience is with `--raw-tcp` and not `--tcp`, I filed a new issue on this (https://github.com/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/issues/866). The issue contains a minimal PoC solution in hopes that developers can use it to help me develop a more official solution.\n\nI look forward to your correspondence.\n\nSincerely,\nbazz\n","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/issues/comments/167143124/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":1,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"bazz1tv","id":2224787,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyMjQ3ODc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2224787?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bazz1tv","html_url":"https://github.com/bazz1tv","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bazz1tv/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bazz1tv/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bazz1tv/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bazz1tv/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bazz1tv/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bazz1tv/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bazz1tv/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bazz1tv/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bazz1tv/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}}]
