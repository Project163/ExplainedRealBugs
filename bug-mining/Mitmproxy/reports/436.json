Run mitmproxy as reverse-proxy mode, like `mitmproxy --mode=reverse:http://localhost -p 443 --certs fullchain-and-privkey.pem --set keep_host_header --modify-header '/x-forwarded-proto/https'`\r\n2. Access to mitmproxy port with HTTPS, `https://localhost` and add some cookies\r\n3. Check actual HTTP request by Wireshark or something (note: some servers are automatically handles multiple cookie headers even HTTP/1.1, like Node.js)\r\n\r\n#### System Information\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ mitmproxy --version\r\nMitmproxy: 8.0.0\r\nPython:    3.10.4\r\nOpenSSL:   OpenSSL 1.1.1o  3 May 2022\r\nPlatform:  macOS-12.3.1-arm64-arm-64bit\r\n```\r\n\r\n(installed from Homebrew)","closed_by":{"login":"mhils","id":1019198,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMTkxOTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1019198?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils","html_url":"https://github.com/mhils","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/issues/5337/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/issues/5337/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
