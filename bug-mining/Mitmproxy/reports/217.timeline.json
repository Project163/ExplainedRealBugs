Fundamentally, addons are not much different from inline scripts¹ and you can actually have your inline script's `start()` method just return an Addon instance (see e.g. the [filt.py](https://github.com/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/blob/master/examples/filt.py) example).\n\nLong story short:\n1. We'll have our 0.18 release pretty soon. If you are developing some larger inline scripts (i.e. large enough to require testing), I would recommend working with that right away and use the return-addon-from-start approach discussed above.\n2. If you do that, you now have all your functionality in a regular Python class and you can import your inline script as a normal Python module. You can have dummy requests and responses from `netlib.tutils`. If you need dummy flows, we're happy to accept a PR that moves `test/mitmproxy/tutils.py` into the mitmproxy package itself.\n\nThere are a couple of changes to the scripting API in 0.18 we're excited about. We'd like to make sure that we cover all major use cases elegantly, so getting early feedback for this would be wonderful. There's no updated documentation yet (#1445), but all examples have been updated to the new syntax - it's mostly just about removing unecessary arguments from the hooks.\n\n¹) An addon is a class that basically just defines a couple of functions which are equivalent to the inline script hooks.\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/issues/comments/249342118/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"mhils","id":1019198,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMTkxOTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1019198?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils","html_url":"https://github.com/mhils","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/issues/comments/249344765","html_url":"https://github.com/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/issues/1572#issuecomment-249344765","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/issues/1572","id":249344765,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI0OTM0NDc2NQ==","user":{"login":"migueleliasweb","id":1608212,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MDgyMTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1608212?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/migueleliasweb","html_url":"https://github.com/migueleliasweb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/migueleliasweb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/migueleliasweb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/migueleliasweb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/migueleliasweb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/migueleliasweb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/migueleliasweb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/migueleliasweb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/migueleliasweb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/migueleliasweb/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-09-24T04:38:04Z","updated_at":"2016-09-24T04:38:04Z","body":"_Just a context for the original question_: At the company I work on, we are searching for ways to implement a reverse proxy for one of our APIs and since the main programming language over here is python we searched for some projects that could help us with that.
