This is in violation of [RFC2616  14.23](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2616#section-14.23), which states\r\n```\r\nA client MUST include a Host header field in all HTTP/1.1 request\r\n   messages . If the requested URI does not include an Internet host\r\n   name for the service being requested, then the Host header field MUST\r\n   be given with an empty value. An HTTP/1.1 proxy MUST ensure that any\r\n   request message it forwards does contain an appropriate Host header\r\n   field that identifies the service being requested by the proxy. All\r\n   Internet-based HTTP/1.1 servers MUST respond with a 400 (Bad Request)\r\n   status code to any HTTP/1.1 request message which lacks a Host header\r\n   field.\r\n```\r\nThis causes the `CONNECT` request to fail when connecting to upstream proxies that enforce this, such as nginx.\r\n\r\nEdit:  updated description to reference the correct RFC.","closed_by":{"login":"mhils","id":1019198,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMTkxOTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1019198?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils","html_url":"https://github.com/mhils","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/issues/7019/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/issues/7019/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
