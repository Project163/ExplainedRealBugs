Prepare a mock endpoint that works with 5 s delay. In this example I will use a configured mock https://hello.free.beeceptor.com/delay\r\n2. Prepare a recording for the endpoint that contains calls to the endpoint with a parameter `param` (any value) and save it to `my.flow`.\r\n3. Launch the software in the reverse proxy mode, using any of following:\r\n  a. `mitmweb --mode reverse:https://hello.free.beeceptor.com --server-replay my.flow --server-replay-nopop --web-port 8888`\r\n  b. `mitmproxy --mode reverse:https://hello.free.beeceptor.com --server-replay my_flow --server-replay-nopop`\r\n4. In the UI:\r\n  a. Go to Options, Edit Options, set `server_replay_ignore_params` to `param` and close Options.\r\n  b. Press Shift-O for Options, scroll to `server_replay_ignore_params`, press `a`, enter `param`, press `Esc`, `q`, `q`.\r\n5. Issue some requests through the proxy with value of `param` not existing in the recording. E.g.  \r\n`curl 'http://localhost:8080/delay?param=value5'`\r\n\r\n**EDIT**: corrected repro steps for TUI.\r\n\r\n#### Problem\r\nThe setting has no effect, you will see 5 s delay in the response.\r\n\r\n#### System Information\r\nMitmproxy: 6.0.2\r\nPython:    3.9.2\r\nOpenSSL:   OpenSSL 1.1.1i  8 Dec 2020\r\nPlatform:  macOS-10.15.7-x86_64-i386-64bit","closed_by":{"login":"mhils","id":1019198,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMTkxOTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1019198?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils","html_url":"https://github.com/mhils","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/issues/4506/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/issues/4506/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
