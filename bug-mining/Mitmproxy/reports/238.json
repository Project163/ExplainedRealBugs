Create the following `script1.py`:\r\n\r\n```\r\nimport mitmproxy.ctx\r\n\r\ndef response(flow):\r\n    mitmproxy.ctx.log.info('this is an info')\r\n    mitmproxy.ctx.log.warn('this is a warning')\r\n    mitmproxy.ctx.log.error('this is an error')\r\n```\r\n\r\n2. Start mitmweb with this script: `mitmweb -s script1.py`\r\n3. Enable *Options* → *Display Event Log* to show the event log pane.\r\n4. Run a flow through mitmweb, for example: `curl -vx http://localhost:8080 http://httpbin.org/get/`\r\n5. Observe that three messages are printed to the system console (“this is an info”, “this is a warning”, “this is an error”), but only one of them is displayed in the event log pane in mitmweb (“this is an info”).\r\n\r\n\r\n##### Any other comments? What have you tried so far?\r\n\r\nChecking the “debug” checkbox at the top right-hand corner of the event log pane has no effect on this.\r\n\r\n##### System information\r\n\r\n(this is mitmproxy master)\r\n\r\nMitmproxy version: 3.0.0 (release version) \r\nPython version: 3.5.2\r\nPlatform: Linux-4.4.0-66-generic-x86_64-with-Ubuntu-16.04-xenial\r\nSSL version: OpenSSL 1.0.2g  1 Mar 2016\r\nLinux distro: Ubuntu 16.04 xenial\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"mhils","id":1019198,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMTkxOTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1019198?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils","html_url":"https://github.com/mhils","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/issues/2134/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/issues/2134/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
