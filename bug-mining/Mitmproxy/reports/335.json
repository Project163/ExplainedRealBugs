Run `mitmweb`\r\n2. Press Ctrl+C in console\r\n3. Nothing happens. \r\n4. if you close web browser, you will get a warning:\r\n5. >`lib\\asyncio\\base_events.py:492`: RuntimeWarning: coroutine 'Master._shutdown' was never awaited\r\n  self._ready.clear()\r\n6. So, you have to kill `python.exe` manually. \r\n\r\n**3.0.4:**\r\n\r\n1. Run `mitmweb`\r\n2. Press Ctrl+C in console\r\n3. `mitmweb` will be closed regardless of a browser.\r\n\r\n\r\n##### Any other comments? What have you tried so far?\r\n\r\n4.0.1 works fine on **Linux**. It may be connected with `asyncio`.\r\n\r\nAnd just a guess: https://gist.github.com/lambdalisue/05d5654bd1ec04992ad316d50924137c (Ctrl+C hotfix patch of asyncio on Windows)\r\n\r\n##### System information\r\n\r\n> Mitmproxy: 4.0.1\r\nPython:    3.6.2 (3.6.5 - the same issue)\r\nOpenSSL:   OpenSSL 1.1.0h  27 Mar 2018\r\nPlatform:  Windows-7-6.1.7601-SP1\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"mhils","id":1019198,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMTkxOTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1019198?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils","html_url":"https://github.com/mhils","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/issues/3133/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/issues/3133/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
