Problem Description\n\nSimilar to [this one](https://github.com/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/issues/659). The `content-length` header value appears correctly in the web UI, but then it is incorrectly overwritten to `0` when executing a *raw* export.\n\n#### Steps to reproduce the behavior:\n1. Send a HEAD request that returns a non-zero `content-length` header value in the response (valid according to RFC)\n> The Content-Length entity-header field indicates the size of the entity-body, in decimal number of OCTETs, sent to the recipient or, in the case of the HEAD method, the size of the entity-body that would have been sent had the request been a GET.\n\n2. Observe the non-zero value in the web UI\n3. Export the raw response and observe that the `content-length` header value in the response has been overwritten to `0`.\n\n\n### System Information\n\n```raw\n\n```\n\n### Checklist\n\n- [x] This bug affects the [latest mitmproxy release](https://github.com/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/releases).","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/issues/7695/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/issues/7695/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
