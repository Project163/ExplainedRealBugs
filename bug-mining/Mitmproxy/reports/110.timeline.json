PR introduces a clear separation of layers in the proxy/protocol core and thereby adds support for a variety of features:\n- HTTP2 support :tada: \n- Clear separation of protocol layers (e.g. separate TLS handling for ConnectionHandler)\n- Smart protocol guessing: We peek into the traffic to determine the actual protocol. In the worst case, we fall back to raw TCP passthrough.\n- Lazy initialization of server connections (#722)\n- Remove \"double-connect\" workaround for SNI by manually reading the handshake.\n##### Open for discussion:\n- Do we want to enable smart protocol guessing initially (while there is not UI in mitmproxy yet) or do we wait until we have a proper UI for this?\n  - Settled for the second variant.\n- Spoof mode and SSL spoof mode have been removed. We should check if this works best as an inline script or as a stand-alone proxy mode. I personally want to keep the number of modes low, but I'm open for discussion here.\n##### TODO:\n- [x] Fix HTTP Replay - probably just HTTP1 for now.\n- [x] Properly process configuration options.\n- [x] Add `--ignore/--tcp` support / clean up `next_layer`\n- [x] Refactor all code that uses `flow.live` to use the new interfaces.\n- [x] Fix Streaming\n- [x] Check inline script hooks.\n- [x] Fix `change_upstream_proxy` example.\n- [x] Fix `dns_spoofing` example.\n- [x] 1dd09a5509219e7390abbb8c0b6818c7e792daa1 is a bit ugly - is there a better way? (no)\n\nFinal TODOs:\n- [x] Remove old code\n- [x] Separate proxy modes from layers (see #742)\n- [x] rename `protocol2` to `protocol` and remove old files\n\n(This PR is a follow up of #694 .)\n- fixes #745\n- fixes #722\n- fixes #717\n- fixes #697\n- fixes #681\n- fixes #672\n- fixes #641\n- refs #483 \n- refs #383\n- refs #743\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/issues/741/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/issues/741/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":398381145,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50Mzk4MzgxMTQ1","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/issues/events/398381145","actor":{"login":"mhils","id":1019198,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMTkxOTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1019198?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils","html_url":"https://github.com/mhils","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2015-09-01T23:16:49Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/issues/comments/136890378","html_url":"https://github.com/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/issues/672#issuecomment-136890378","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/issues/672","id":136890378,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDEzNjg5MDM3OA==","user":{"login":"mhils","id":1019198,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMTkxOTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1019198?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils","html_url":"https://github.com/mhils","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-09-01T23:24:50Z","updated_at":"2015-09-01T23:24:50Z","body":"Thanks, this is fixed on master now. :smile: \n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/issues/comments/136890378/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"mhils","id":1019198,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMTkxOTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1019198?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils","html_url":"https://github.com/mhils","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}}]
