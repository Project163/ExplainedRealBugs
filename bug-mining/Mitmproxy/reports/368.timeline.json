For two people in our team homebrew decided to do housekeeping and updated mitmproxy version number without consent. That would not be a problem if homebrew would have kept the old version locally OR if the old version would still be available to download in the net. Alas neither of these is true. So for those two people the only option is to use the docker images or the precompiled binaries.

Thanks for the very polite bugging. :) I'll try to squeeze this in somewhere tomorrow.\r\n\r\nRegarding your questions:\r\n\r\nWe didn't even touch the map local addon between 5.2 and 5.3, so no

homebrew. [...]\r\n\r\nThere's not much we can do on the homebrew front (we do very much appreciate how quick they update if we publish releases though). You can get old standalone binaries at https://mitmproxy.org/downloads/, you can use `pipx`, or you can use the Docker images. Doesn't that qualify as \"the old version is still available to download in the net\"?

confirm that the fixed version is working! Thanks!\r\n\r\nAnd you are correct in that there are alternatives to homebrew. Thankfully. What I meant was that on the mitmproxy website the homebrew version is the advertised way to use mitmproxy and this case just showed that it is also the most fragile way to use mitmproxy (unable to change the version and you are stuck with what it gives you). Someone who is not tech-savvy might reject mitmproxy as an option if it does not work the way intended without looking for alternative ways to use the application. But this is not your fault and was just a sidetracked comment. So nevermind that and the main point is that the bug is fixed and will work in the future 👍 ","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/issues/comments/743446223/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"Krakau","id":7141241,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcxNDEyNDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7141241?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Krakau","html_url":"https://github.com/Krakau","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Krakau/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Krakau/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Krakau/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Krakau/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Krakau/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Krakau/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Krakau/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Krakau/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Krakau/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":4104343682,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDQxMDQzNDM2ODI=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/issues/events/4104343682","actor":{"login":"mhils","id":1019198,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMTkxOTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1019198?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils","html_url":"https://github.com/mhils","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"64b8fa4ce9a43fc8426acf52d6ee7568e04b0991","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/commits/64b8fa4ce9a43fc8426acf52d6ee7568e04b0991","created_at":"2020-12-12T15:11:05Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":4104815268,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDQxMDQ4MTUyNjg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/issues/events/4104815268","actor":{"login":"mhils","id":1019198,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMTkxOTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1019198?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils","html_url":"https://github.com/mhils","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"52479e94bbc92caf198481af3bc0989bfa94716f","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mhils/mitmproxy/commits/52479e94bbc92caf198481af3bc0989bfa94716f","created_at":"2020-12-12T20:24:30Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
