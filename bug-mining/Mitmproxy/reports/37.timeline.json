@clarkewd,\n\nreverse proxy - which targets a single destination server - is the wrong mode here.\nYou could configure your client to use a regular HTTP proxy and then reroute everything using an enhanced version of `change_server` (I think we discussed that already, right? :wink:). \nIf you're looking for the opposite way, take a look at sslstrip.\n\nCheers,\nMax\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/issues/comments/50510516/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"mhils","id":1019198,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMTkxOTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1019198?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils","html_url":"https://github.com/mhils","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":146843418,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MTQ2ODQzNDE4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/issues/events/146843418","actor":{"login":"clarkewd","id":156377,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1NjM3Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/156377?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clarkewd","html_url":"https://github.com/clarkewd","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clarkewd/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clarkewd/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clarkewd/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clarkewd/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clarkewd/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clarkewd/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clarkewd/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clarkewd/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clarkewd/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2014-07-29T17:36:42Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":146843419,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDE0Njg0MzQxOQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/issues/events/146843419","actor":{"login":"clarkewd","id":156377,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1NjM3Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/156377?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clarkewd","html_url":"https://github.com/clarkewd","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clarkewd/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clarkewd/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clarkewd/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clarkewd/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clarkewd/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clarkewd/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clarkewd/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clarkewd/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clarkewd/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2014-07-29T17:36:42Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/issues/comments/50511042","html_url":"https://github.com/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/issues/317#issuecomment-50511042","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/issues/317","id":50511042,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUwNTExMDQy","user":{"login":"mhils","id":1019198,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMTkxOTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1019198?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils","html_url":"https://github.com/mhils","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-07-29T17:40:07Z","updated_at":"2014-08-03T00:02:07Z","body":"Regarding
