same experience. FYI: There's probably some shared resource that gets overwritten, in a short time window just after request begins executing. If I add e.g. time.sleep(.05) as the first line of my @concurrent-decorated request method, or even a context.log() or print() behaviour becomes as expected.

And although my request and response methods will eventually involve slow system calls into the filesystem, they do not, at this experimental stage. It's just dict lookups now. The fact that this is actually a degenerate case is quite likely why you haven't noticed it. Most excellent work, BTW.
