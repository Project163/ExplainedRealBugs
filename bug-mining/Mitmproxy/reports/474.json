Run two network interfaces (e.g. primary NIC1=192.168.1.10/24, NIC2=192.168.2.10/24)\r\n2. mitmweb --mode wireguard --listen-host 192.168.2.10/24\r\n3. mitm wireguard config is generated with endpoint 192.168.1.10/32.\r\n\r\n#### System Information\r\n```\r\n~ mitmweb --version\r\nMitmproxy: 10.2.2\r\nPython:    3.12.1\r\nOpenSSL:   OpenSSL 3.1.4 24 Oct 2023\r\nPlatform:  macOS-14.3.1-arm64-arm-64bit\r\n```\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"mhils","id":1019198,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMTkxOTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1019198?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils","html_url":"https://github.com/mhils","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/issues/6656/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/issues/6656/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
