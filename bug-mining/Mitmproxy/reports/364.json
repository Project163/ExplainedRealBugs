Capture WebSocket traffic: `mitmdump -w infile ~websocket`\r\n2. Apply a filter of `~websocket`: `mitmdump -nr infile -w outfile ~websocket`\r\n\r\nThe result is a non-empty `infile`, which contains the expected WebSocket messages, and an **empty** `outfile` even though they should contain the same data.\r\n\r\nIn addition, I also noticed that `mitmdump -nr infile` produces no output whatsoever, even with `-v` to increase the verbosity. I'm aware that the UI does not properly support WebSocket (#1020), but I'd expect it to at least report that messages exist as it does during dumping (i.e. `127.0.0.1:57466 -> WebSocket 1 message -> URL` etc.). This does not happen when the initial capturing is done without a filter, i.e. those \"message\" log lines appear in that case. This might point at a more fundamental issue with reading back the WebSocket data than just the filtering.\r\n\r\n#### System Information\r\n```\r\n$ mitmproxy --version\r\nMitmproxy: 5.1.1 (+2, commit a8ca63f)\r\nPython:    3.8.2\r\nOpenSSL:   OpenSSL 1.1.1g  21 Apr 2020\r\nPlatform:  Linux-5.6.0-1-amd64-x86_64-with-glibc2.29\r\n```\r\n\r\n(Regarding the version number, see #3987; this is a clean 5.1.1 installation.)","closed_by":{"login":"mhils","id":1019198,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMTkxOTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1019198?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils","html_url":"https://github.com/mhils","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/issues/3990/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/issues/3990/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
