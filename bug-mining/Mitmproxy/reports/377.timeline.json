I've done some research on the topic:\r\n\r\n[HTTP 1.1 spec](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2616#section-5.1.2) says that Request-Line `GET http://wikipedia.com HTTP/1.1` is actually a malformed one: \r\n```Note that the absolute path cannot be empty; if none is present in the original URI, it MUST be given as \"/\" (the server root).```\r\nIt also says: ```A transparent proxy MUST NOT rewrite the \"abs_path\" part of the received Request-URI when forwarding it to the next inbound server, except as noted above to replace a null abs_path with \"/\".```\r\n\r\nHaving this, I think we should fix
