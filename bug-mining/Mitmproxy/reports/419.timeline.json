The helper use Network Extension API of iOS capture all **IP packets**\r\n2. Next assemble into **TCP stream**\r\n3. Next assemble into **socks5 stream**\r\n4. Next send to mitmproxy (**because mitmproxy supports Standard Socks5 Prototol**)\r\n\r\n---\r\nWhy our team built this and choose the way, we tried a lot of mobile capture software, most mobile capture softwares choose way like this:\r\n\r\n- Configure socks5 proxy on system network\r\n- Some even use the Network Extension API to set up system proxy(**because work with IP packets, you must write a full TCP/IP stack**)\r\n\r\nbut system proxy is easy to be bypassed, if app developer just add this line on there app, then **bypassed**:\r\n```\r\nsessionConfig.connectionProxyDictionary =
