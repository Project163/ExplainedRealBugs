Run mitmproxy.\r\n2. Press `n` -> `Enter` -> `Enter` -> `e` -> `set-cookies`\r\n3. Press `a` to add a new row.\r\n4. Choose `Attributes` column and enter subeditor. \r\n5. Add any name-value pair, for example `a    1`.\r\n6. Go to flowview tab by pressing `q` twice. You will see this in Response tab:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/20267977/35624324-5704d498-0697-11e8-8352-6b691bcf0507.png)\r\nI am not sure it is correct to display just `=` without anything \r\n\r\n7. Press `e` -> `set-cookies`. You will see, that name-value from `Attributes` column moved to high-level name-value:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/20267977/35624767-a2dc5e80-0698-11e8-8206-397f98d933b3.png)\r\n\r\n`set-cookies` was changed in Response tab as well. \r\nStrange behaviour.\r\n \r\n##### Any other comments?
