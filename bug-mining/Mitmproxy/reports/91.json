This seems to indicate to me mitmproxy is not handling the Expect header request/response flow correctly.\n\ncurl through mitmproxy with Expect header\n\n```\n* Connected to www.redeye.dev (127.0.0.1) port 19200 (#0)\n> POST /drawings_index HTTP/1.1\n> User-Agent: curl/7.29.0\n> Host: www.redeye.dev:19200\n> Accept: */*\n> Content-Length: 15752\n> Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded\n> Expect: 100-continue\n> \n* Done waiting for 100-continue\n  0 15752    0     0    0     0      0      0 --:--:--  0:00:01 --:--:--     0} [data not shown]\n< HTTP/1.1 100 Continue\n< Content-Length: 0\n\n... hangs here indefinitely with curl waiting to read the response from the server\n```\n\ncurl without mitmproxy with Expect header\n\n```\n*   Trying 127.0.0.1...\n* Connected to www.redeye.dev (127.0.0.1) port 9200 (#0)\n> POST /drawings_index HTTP/1.1\n> User-Agent: curl/7.29.0\n> Host: www.redeye.dev:9200\n> Accept: */*\n> Content-Length: 15752\n> Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded\n> Expect: 100-continue\n> \n< HTTP/1.1 100 Continue\n} [data not shown]\n< HTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request\n< Content-Type: application/json; charset=UTF-8\n< Content-Length: 85\n* HTTP error before end of send, stop sending\n< \n{ [data not shown]\n100 15837  100    85  100 15752    532  98652 --:--:-- --:--:-- --:--:-- 99069\n* Closing connection 0\n```\n\nForcing curl to avoid the Expect header with -H \"Expect: \" through mitmproxy\n\n```\n* Connected to www.redeye.dev (127.0.0.1) port 19200 (#0)\n> POST /drawings_index HTTP/1.1\n> User-Agent: curl/7.29.0\n> Host: www.redeye.dev:19200\n> Accept: */*\n> Content-Length: 15752\n> Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded\n> \n} [data not shown]\n* upload completely sent off: 15752 out of 15752 bytes\n< HTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request\n< Content-Type: application/json; charset=UTF-8\n< Content-Length: 85\n< \n{ [data not shown]\n100 15837  100    85  100 15752   2622   474k --:--:-- --:--:-- --:--:--  480k\n* Connection #0 to host www.redeye.dev left intact\n```\n\nIf I get a chance I'll dig into the source (not a Python programmer by trade) and see if I can work out what's going on.\n\nmitmproxy without Expect header\n\n```\n   POST http://www.redeye.dev:9200/drawings_index\n        ← 400 application/json 85B 43.22kB/s\n```\n\nmitmproxy with Expect header\n\n```\n   POST http://www.redeye.dev:9200/drawings_index\n        ← 100 [no content] 30.87kB/s\n```\n","closed_by":{"login":"mhils","id":1019198,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMTkxOTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1019198?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils","html_url":"https://github.com/mhils","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/issues/553/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/issues/553/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
