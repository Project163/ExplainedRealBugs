I don't think it happens all the time, but see below for repeatable reproduction.\r\n\r\n#### Steps to reproduce the behavior:\r\n1. Start `mitmproxy`\r\n2. Hit `n` to create a new flow\r\n3. Hit Enter\r\n4. Hit `r` to issue the request\r\n5. With the same flow selected, issue the command `:replay.server @focus`\r\n6. Issue the command `:replay.server.count`\r\n\r\nSample stack trace:\r\n```python\r\n  File \"/home/elespike/venvs/mitmproxy/lib/python3.9/site-packages/mitmproxy/tools/console/grideditor/editors.py\", line 222, in __init__\r\n    if not isinstance(vals[0], list):\r\nTypeError: 'int' object is not subscriptable\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### System Information\r\n```\r\nMitmproxy: 7.0.4\r\nPython:    3.9.2\r\n```","closed_by":{"login":"mhils","id":1019198,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMTkxOTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1019198?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils","html_url":"https://github.com/mhils","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/issues/4902/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/issues/4902/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
