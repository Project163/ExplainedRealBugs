#1928, I wrote a simple script to test how should we fix this:\r\n```python\r\nimport time\r\n\r\nfrom mitmproxy.script import concurrent\r\n\r\n\r\nclass ConcurrentClass:\r\n\r\n    @concurrent  # Remove this and see what happens\r\n    def request(flow):\r\n        # You don't want to use mitmproxy.ctx from a different thread\r\n        print(\"handle request: %s%s\" % (flow.request.host, flow.request.path))\r\n        time.sleep(5)\r\n        print(\"start  request: %s%s\" % (flow.request.host, flow.request.path))\r\n\r\n\r\ndef start():\r\n    return ConcurrentClass()\r\n\r\n```\r\nIf we load this script and request a web page, it will throw something like \"take one positional argument but two were given\", it seems that the method in the class accept a hidden parameter `self`. The first things came out of my head is adding a decorator `@staticmethod` for the methods, but that's not neat enough and also increase the burden of script developers.\r\n\r\nThen I call the `staticmethod()` before returning the `_concurrent`, however, we should determine if the function is in a class or not. I tried to use the metadata `__self__` or `__class__`, but unfortunately, the decorator does not preserve such metadata for us, so I look up all the thing we could use in `dir(fn)`.\r\n\r\nI found the `__qualname__` could be used, for example, for the script above, `request.__qualname__` would be `ConcurrentClass.request`, but for a function out of class, the value would be simply `request`. A dot `.` is enough to judge these two situations.\r\n\r\nI know this is kind of strange, but it works fine. If you have any other idea, please do let me know.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/issues/2051/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/issues/2051/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":970814075,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50OTcwODE0MDc1","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/issues/events/970814075","actor":{"login":"mhils","id":1019198,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMTkxOTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1019198?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils","html_url":"https://github.com/mhils","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2017-02-21T14:38:35Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":970814118,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDk3MDgxNDExOA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/issues/events/970814118","actor":{"login":"mhils","id":1019198,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMTkxOTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1019198?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils","html_url":"https://github.com/mhils","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"f9714fbf3e595ba4c93ef036bfe63e3b63e256ab","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/commits/f9714fbf3e595ba4c93ef036bfe63e3b63e256ab","created_at":"2017-02-21T14:38:37Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":970814121,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDk3MDgxNDEyMQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/issues/events/970814121","actor":{"login":"mhils","id":1019198,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMTkxOTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1019198?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils","html_url":"https://github.com/mhils","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mhils/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"2df2fc1f38e15b818a9758d4cfab38ccd48b345e","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/commits/2df2fc1f38e15b818a9758d4cfab38ccd48b345e","created_at":"2017-02-21T14:38:37Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":984907924,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDk4NDkwNzkyNA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/issues/events/984907924","actor":{"login":"krsoninikhil","id":6498693,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0OTg2OTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6498693?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/krsoninikhil","html_url":"https://github.com/krsoninikhil","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/krsoninikhil/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/krsoninikhil/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/krsoninikhil/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/krsoninikhil/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/krsoninikhil/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://ap
