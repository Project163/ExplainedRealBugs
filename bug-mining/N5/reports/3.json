In N5FSTest, the `testDirPath` is set to ~/tmp/n5-test. But this clutters up the user's home directory, especially since this directory is not deleted after testing is complete. Better would be to use `Files.createTempDirectory` to create the directory in the dedicated temp file space, and `File.deleteOnExit` to remove it cleanly when the JVM shuts down.\r\n\r\nThis is also an issue with the various n5 extensions:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ rg tmp.n5-test\r\nn5-blosc/src/test/java/org/janelia/saalfeldlab/n5/blosc/BloscCompressionTest.java\r\n52:\tstatic private String testDirPath = System.getProperty(\"user.home\") + \"/tmp/n5-test\";\r\n\r\nn5-viewer/src/test/java/org/janelia/saalfeldlab/n5/bdv/N5SourceFromMetadataTest.java\r\n34:\tstatic private String testDirPath = System.getProperty(\"user.home\") + \"/tmp/n5-test\";\r\n\r\nn5-zarr/src/test/java/org/janelia/saalfeldlab/n5/zarr/N5ZarrTest.java\r\n78:\tstatic private String testDirPath = System.getProperty(\"user.home\") + \"/tmp/n5-test.zarr\";\r\n\r\nn5-hdf5/src/test/java/org/janelia/saalfeldlab/n5/hdf5/N5HDF5Test.java\r\n76:\tprivate static String testDirPath = System.getProperty(\"user.home\") + \"/tmp/n5-test.hdf5\";\r\n\r\nn5-ij/src/test/java/org/janelia/saalfeldlab/n5/MetadataIoTests.java\r\n67:\tstatic private String testDirPath = System.getProperty(\"user.home\") + \"/tmp/n5-test\";\r\n\r\nn5/src/test/java/org/janelia/saalfeldlab/n5/N5FSTest.java\r\n29:\tstatic private String testDirPath = System.getProperty(\"user.home\") + \"/tmp/n5-test\";\r\n```\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"cmhulbert","id":1859669,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NTk2Njk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1859669?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmhulbert","html_url":"https://github.com/cmhulbert","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmhulbert/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmhulbert/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmhulbert/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmhulbert/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmhulbert/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmhulbert/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmhulbert/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmhulbert/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmhulbert/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/saalfeldlab/n5/issues/88/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/saalfeldlab/n5/issues/88/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
