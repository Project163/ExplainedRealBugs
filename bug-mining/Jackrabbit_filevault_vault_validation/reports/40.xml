            <title>[JCRVLT-683] Import of Authorizable node with acHandling=IGNORE should preserve existing rep:principalPolicy child node</title>
                <link>https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/JCRVLT-683</link>
                <project id="12314920" key="JCRVLT">Jackrabbit FileVault</project>
                    <description>&lt;p&gt;For situations where an authorizable node may be distributed from another environment where a different rep:principalPolicy for the user is defined than exists for that user in the target environment, it is important that the existing rep:principalPolicy be preserved when acHandling is unset, acHandling=IGNORE, or acHandling=MERGE_PRESERVE.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Currently, the effective behavior of such a package install, as &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/apache/jackrabbit-filevault/blob/5f9657374bd6c2d3dd1f6e9e2be0b9f5b25ddc26/vault-core/src/main/java/org/apache/jackrabbit/vault/fs/impl/io/DocViewImporter.java#L782-L787&quot; class=&quot;external-link&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;it appears to be implemented in DocViewImporter&lt;/a&gt;, results in the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;If the package specifies acHandling=IGNORE, the existing rep:principalPolicy is deleted without replacement, regardless of whether the package contains its own rep:principalPolicy, which is equivalent to &lt;b&gt;acHandling=CLEAR&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;If the package specifies acHandling=MERGE_PRESERVE or MERGE, the existing rep:principalPolicy is replaced with whatever rep:principalPolicy is contained in the package, or deletes the policy if a replacement is not present, which is equivalent to &lt;b&gt;acHandling=OVERWRITE&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Unexpectedly, the least destructive (and most default) acHandling mode (IGNORE) turns out to be as destructive to packaged system user permissions as choosing any other mode.&#160;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Is any other ACL type outlined at &lt;a href=&quot;https://jackrabbit.apache.org/filevault/acls.html&quot; class=&quot;external-link&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;https://jackrabbit.apache.org/filevault/acls.html&lt;/a&gt; affected apart from &lt;tt&gt;rep:PrincipalPolicy&lt;/tt&gt; or does the issue only appear because &lt;tt&gt;rep:PrincipalPolicy&lt;/tt&gt; appears below an authorizable node?&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="17685389" author="madamcin" created="Tue, 7 Feb 2023 17:16:32 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;I&apos;m working on those ITs. I think it is really only an issue with rep:PrincipalPolicy nodes in practice, because of that reason that you mention. Traditional ACLs are rarely added as children of non-system user accounts, because non-system user accounts are not generally not located at predictable (or even human-readable) paths, and so permissions over their home nodes is usually granted at the level of /home or /home/users via group membership. Permissions on resources outside of /home for normal users are also granted by traditional ACLs on those resources, so the replacement of an existing normal user&apos;s Authorizable node on import ultimately does not affect any of that user&apos;s applicable policies. Someone might come along with a use case for preserving traditional ACLs under rep:User or rep:SystemUser nodes, but that I think any such case could be solved by authorizable folder management.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="17685445" author="madamcin" created="Tue, 7 Feb 2023 19:22:44 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/ViewProfile.jspa?name=kwin&quot; class=&quot;user-hover&quot; rel=&quot;kwin&quot;&gt;kwin&lt;/a&gt; I added a link to a PR with ITs&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="17712695" author="kwin" created="Sat, 15 Apr 2023 17:40:38 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;I was looking into this and basically this requires the following changes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;alternate&quot; type=&quot;square&quot;&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Before deleting a node during import (in DocViewImporter#endDocViewNode(...)):
	&lt;ul class=&quot;alternate&quot; type=&quot;square&quot;&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;check if it contains a principal ACL (resource ACLs don&apos;t matter, as they are no longer relevant if the according resource is removed, while for authorizables they might still be relevant, as authorizables might be recreated through the package at another location)&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;store the principal ACL in some temporary object&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;/ul&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;When creating a new authorizable
	&lt;ul class=&quot;alternate&quot; type=&quot;square&quot;&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;Persist its authorizable id in some helper object&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;/ul&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;At the end of the import:
	&lt;ul class=&quot;alternate&quot; type=&quot;square&quot;&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;Restore those principal ACLs according to the ACImportMode which refer to authorizables which have been (re)created by the package&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;/ul&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This does potentially have a major performance impact, because there is no official API for both JR2/Oak which allows to figure out below which path a User/Group may exist at all (to bail out quickly and not trigger a search/traversal for ACLs below nodes which may never contain authorizables).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Oak the user/group entry path is maintained in &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/apache/jackrabbit-oak/blob/c6ddcc55bee3de915459af01e91edad32d538f3d/oak-core/src/main/java/org/apache/jackrabbit/oak/security/user/UserProvider.java#L176-L177&quot; class=&quot;external-link&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;https://github.com/apache/jackrabbit-oak/blob/c6ddcc55bee3de915459af01e91edad32d538f3d/oak-core/src/main/java/org/apache/jackrabbit/oak/security/user/UserProvider.java#L176-L177&lt;/a&gt; and the UserProvider is a private field in &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/apache/jackrabbit-oak/blob/c6ddcc55bee3de915459af01e91edad32d538f3d/oak-core/src/main/java/org/apache/jackrabbit/oak/security/user/UserManagerImpl.java#L79&quot; class=&quot;external-link&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;https://github.com/apache/jackrabbit-oak/blob/c6ddcc55bee3de915459af01e91edad32d538f3d/oak-core/src/main/java/org/apache/jackrabbit/oak/security/user/UserManagerImpl.java#L79&lt;/a&gt;. Just going with the defaults won&apos;t work either, as AEM overwrites the default user/group root path from &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/apache/jackrabbit-oak/blob/c6ddcc55bee3de915459af01e91edad32d538f3d/oak-security-spi/src/main/java/org/apache/jackrabbit/oak/spi/security/user/UserConstants.java#L119&quot; class=&quot;external-link&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;https://github.com/apache/jackrabbit-oak/blob/c6ddcc55bee3de915459af01e91edad32d538f3d/oak-security-spi/src/main/java/org/apache/jackrabbit/oak/spi/security/user/UserConstants.java#L119&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

                            <comment id="17713414" author="anchela" created="Tue, 18 Apr 2023 06:41:54 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;hi &lt;a href=&quot;https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/ViewProfile.jspa?name=kwin&quot; class=&quot;user-hover&quot; rel=&quot;kwin&quot;&gt;kwin&lt;/a&gt;, i would need to take another look at the filevault code. but what i vaguely remember is that filevault is using XML import by default and without this import allowing to reflect the various import-mode imposed needs from filevault which leads to a lot of workarounds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;what i can say though with respect to this bug report:&lt;br/&gt;
in general i would expect that service users and their principal-based access control setup (out of the box it is not supported for any other type of users) are defined with Sling repo-init and not with content packages due to the fact that they usually must be ready upon service registration. also note that the Sling content-package 2 featuremodel converter will extract any ac-setup for service users and convert them to repoinit statements.... so, IMHO this bug should be treated with minor priority.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/ViewProfile.jspa?name=madamcin&quot; class=&quot;user-hover&quot; rel=&quot;madamcin&quot;&gt;madamcin&lt;/a&gt;, can you share some context on why you are defining ac-setup for service users with a content package and not with repo-init? thanks.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="17713420" author="anchela" created="Tue, 18 Apr 2023 06:46:35 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;one more note: this bug report doesn&apos;t specify where the service user is being moved. but in case the user would be moved to a location where principal-based access control setup was not supported, the the policy should probably be removed irrespective of the import mode defined. (but that just for completeness).&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="17713776" author="madamcin" created="Tue, 18 Apr 2023 21:35:25 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/ViewProfile.jspa?name=angela&quot; class=&quot;user-hover&quot; rel=&quot;angela&quot;&gt;angela&lt;/a&gt; The background for this ticket is documented in GRANITE-44323 and GRANITE-44324. The issue is not really about ac-setup per se, but about how the current implementation makes it difficult to reliably distribute mutable content (such as a keystore) located within a service user&apos;s authorizable node between repositories when they have different rep:principalPolicy nodes. Ideally, the package created by an Admin to distribute the mutable content for a service user would have a filter root with the absolute path to the authorizable node, and an acHandling option set to IGNORE. The current implementation quietly results in a surprising effect where, having installed the package, the service user loses the jcr:read permission on its authorizable node and the newly installed mutable content. The Admin can verify that the content is present in the UI, whereas the application logs indicate that the content is not present, when accessed by the service user&apos;s resource resolver.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="17713915" author="anchela" created="Wed, 19 Apr 2023 06:21:41 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/ViewProfile.jspa?name=madamcin&quot; class=&quot;user-hover&quot; rel=&quot;madamcin&quot;&gt;madamcin&lt;/a&gt;, thanks for the additional explanation. i would like to note though that adobe internal ticket references don&apos;t make too much sense here as not everyone has access to that information. i would recommend to always extract the relevant information such that no adobe internal information/context is needed.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="17718533" author="reschke" created="Tue, 2 May 2023 11:44:35 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;My 2 cents: I have no idea whether this change is needed. But I will note that if it might break existing workflows/content, it should be possible to opt-out this behavior (or actually make it opt-in).&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="17718535" author="kwin" created="Tue, 2 May 2023 11:50:25 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;Every code relying on that bug can be easily fixed by adjusting the aclHandling. But for me this is a valid bug report and deserves an unconditional fix. I cannot think of a situation where this causes regressions (except for maybe unintended cases which rather lead to security issues and therefore need to be fixed). ACLs inadvertently removed from nodes is a potential security issue (as this might open access)&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="17719719" author="tmueller" created="Fri, 5 May 2023 07:47:29 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; Every code relying on that bug can be easily fixed by adjusting the aclHandling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In general, I think that most bugfixes should come with &quot;circuit breakers&quot; (feature flags) that allow people to disable the &quot;bugfix&quot;, specially if the bugfix changes behavior. In the past, we have used system properties to allow switching back to the old behavior. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(There are bugfixes that &lt;em&gt;don&apos;t&lt;/em&gt; change the behavior, for example if they only improve performance.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also think that most changes should be reviewed. It seems the linked PRs don&apos;t currently have reviewers; is think the review process is done in some other way? Update: sorry, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/apache/jackrabbit-filevault/pull/272&quot; class=&quot;external-link&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;https://github.com/apache/jackrabbit-filevault/pull/272&lt;/a&gt; doesn&apos;t have reviewers; &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/apache/jackrabbit-filevault/pull/294&quot; class=&quot;external-link&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;https://github.com/apache/jackrabbit-filevault/pull/294&lt;/a&gt; has reviewers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PRs should also come with test cases. Is it true that &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/apache/jackrabbit-filevault/pull/294/files&quot; class=&quot;external-link&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;https://github.com/apache/jackrabbit-filevault/pull/294/files&lt;/a&gt; doesn&apos;t have any test case?  There are a lot of code changes as far as I see.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="17719721" author="kwin" created="Fri, 5 May 2023 07:53:42 +0000"  >&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/apache/jackrabbit-filevault/pull/272&quot; class=&quot;external-link&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;https://github.com/apache/jackrabbit-filevault/pull/272&lt;/a&gt; doesn&apos;t have reviewers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is superseded by &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/apache/jackrabbit-filevault/pull/294&quot; class=&quot;external-link&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;https://github.com/apache/jackrabbit-filevault/pull/294&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
In general I always add reviewer but they rarely react, therefore after some time I go ahead and merge. But everyone is involved to review, that includes you of course as well &lt;a href=&quot;https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/ViewProfile.jspa?name=thomasm&quot; class=&quot;user-hover&quot; rel=&quot;thomasm&quot;&gt;thomasm&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Is it true that &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/apache/jackrabbit-filevault/pull/294/files&quot; class=&quot;external-link&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;https://github.com/apache/jackrabbit-filevault/pull/294/files&lt;/a&gt; doesn&apos;t have any test case?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No, lots of ITs have been added (&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/apache/jackrabbit-filevault/pull/294/files#diff-038077103e482e4a69670d008bbd1c150aab6edb9c6cb2d8e531940b094170e9&quot; class=&quot;external-link&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;https://github.com/apache/jackrabbit-filevault/pull/294/files#diff-038077103e482e4a69670d008bbd1c150aab6edb9c6cb2d8e531940b094170e9&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In general, I think that most bugfixes should come with &quot;circuit breakers&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well in this case I don&apos;t think it is necessary but if you want to add a toggle please enrich the PR.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>

&lt;p&gt;Well, that&apos;s not how reviews work... You don&apos;t ask the reviewer to add something that the author should do.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/kwin&quot; class=&quot;external-link&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;@kwin&lt;/a&gt;&#160;this branch has an amended commit that I don&apos;t have permission to force-push to the existing upstream PR branch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The diff of the amended commit is essentially:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;to add the feature flag support to the Importer class&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;to fork the original PrincipalBasedIT into a parallel PrincipalBasedStashingIT, instead of changing its assertions in-place, so that the before and after behavior can be tested simultaneously.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I defined the feature flag above to work as a system property for setting a global default value, as well as supporting a package property of the same name for switching the behavior on individual packages. This should allow us to test the new behavior in different contexts and different downstream tools without having to expose the flag as part of the filevault java API. I left all of your stashing and policy enhancement implementation unmodified after determining that the feature flag could be evaluated at a single point in the Importer, just prior to the calling the&#160;&lt;tt&gt;restorePrincipalAcls&lt;/tt&gt;&#160;method, and could be leveraged when disabled to add diagnostic messages to the progress tracker log.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
