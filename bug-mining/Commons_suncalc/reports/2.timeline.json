that tripped me up at first. :) I had a wonderful time figuring out how your quadratic interpolator works -- that's amazingly cool! Then I started thinking about how to get those last few degrees of accuracy for noon and nadir given the quadratic-interpolated values of noon and nadir as starting points.\r\n\r\nA test of my proof-of-principle solution is [here](https://github.com/isomeme/Helios/blob/master/helios/src/test/java/org/onereed/helios/sun/SunCalcTest.java#L86). Below that line are tests showing SunTimes getting noon and nadir wrong, followed by my new NoonNadirCorrector turning them into azimuths correct within 0.25 degree. The basic idea is to assume that near noon and nadir the rate degrees/time is fairly constant. We pick a new time deltaTime from the current time, and calculate their deltaAzimuth and the error between the new azimuth and 0/180. We scale deltaTime and repeat until the error falls below 0.25 degrees (1 minute of the sun's motion).\r\n\r\nThis is sloppy code, with bad naming, System.out.printf calls, and so forth. There's a lot of room to tune things like picking the initial deltaTime more intelligently. But it seems to converge rapidly for the cases I've tested. Perhaps you can use something like this in SunTimes.\r\n\r\nThis technique wouldn't apply to sunrise and sunset, where we're not looking for a fixed degree value like 0 or 180. But it's also true that deviations in these won't be so obvious when you display the sun events on a compass graphic. :)\r\n","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/shred/commons-suncalc/issues/comments/639995577/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"isomeme","id":35911229,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1OTExMjI5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/35911229?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/isomeme","html_url":"https://github.com/isomeme","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/isomeme/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/isomeme/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/isomeme/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/isomeme/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/isomeme/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/isomeme/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/isomeme/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/isomeme/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/isomeme/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/shred/commons-suncalc/issues/comments/640057062","html_url":"https://github.com/shred/commons-suncalc/issues/20#issuecomment-640057062","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/shred/commons-suncalc/issues/20","id":640057062,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY0MDA1NzA2Mg==","user":{"login":"shred","id":505118,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNTExOA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/505118?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/shred","html_url":"https://github.com/shred","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shred/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shred/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shred/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shred/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shred/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shred/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shred/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shred/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shred/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-06-06T12:56:26Z","updated_at":"2020-06-06T12:56:26Z","body":"To give proper credits: I've found the quadratic interpolator in the book \"Astronomy on the Personal Computer\" by Montenbruck/Pfleger.
