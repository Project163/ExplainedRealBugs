The refinement is then supposed to find the true peak around the estimated time plus/minus two hours, to fully enclose the 3 hours.\r\n\r\nHowever, in my code I added/subtracted `2/24.0` to the estimated time, because somehow I had assumed that I'm using days instead of hours. The window for the refinement only had a 24th of the correct size. If the peak was outside that window (which is likely), it was just rounded to the closest window limit.\r\n\r\nIn my fix, I now add/subtract the correct value of 2 hours, to get the expected 4 hours window. I also use a recursion depth of 14 for the nested intervals now, giving 2^14 = 16384 iterations within that window. Altogether, the peak value is now found with a resolution of less than a second (because 4 hours window size * 60 * 60 = 14400 seconds).\r\n\r\nI hope this fix will now finally retire your corrector code. :smile: \r\n\r\nCan you build the main branch and try it with your app?\r\n\r\n(PS: I hope the explanation was halfway understandable.
