It's wonderful being able to use java.time directly, though I would have gone with Instant rather than ZonedDateTime. But I'm kind of a crazy purist, so take that with a grain of salt. :) And the noon/nadir accuracy is *massively* better. Nice work. I look forward to digging into the code again to see what you did.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, I don't know whether you'll consider this a bug or a feature request, but SunTimes in non-fullCycle mode misses sunrises or sets that occur just over 24 hours after the preceding one. I cleaned out all my old SunCalc tests after looking through your own ones, so my [SunCalcTest](https://github.com/isomeme/Helios/blob/master/helios/src/test/java/org/onereed/helios/sun/SunCalcTest.java) class now has just one test, demonstrating what I'm talking about. \r\n\r\nIt seems like having non-fullCycle mode keep looking some reasonable time past 24 hours would fix this, and make the behavior more useful. As it stands, if I want to be sure to catch these just-over-the-line cases, I have to do two SunTimes calls and combine the results.","closed_by":{"login":"shred","id":505118,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNTExOA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/505118?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/shred","html_url":"https://github.com/shred","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shred/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shred/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shred/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shred/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shred/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shred/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shred/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shred/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shred/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/shred/commons-suncalc/issues/21/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/shred/commons-suncalc/issues/21/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
