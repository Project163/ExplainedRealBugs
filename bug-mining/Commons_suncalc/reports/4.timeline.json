It would give results that look strange on the first sight, e.g. if your system is located in Paris and you calculate the sunrise in New York, an `Instant` result would look like the sun rises in New York at around noon. With `ZonedDateTime` it is always clear what timezone the result is related to. And as a side benefit, you can use methods like `.getHour()` to easily read the result. I agree that it seems to be overly complicated if you are only using your local timezone. But you can still use `.toInstant()` to get the `Instant` of a result.\r\n\r\nNon-fullCycle() is meant as a 24-hour mode. My intention was to start the calculation at midnight, and then use the 24-hour mode to only find the events of the very same day. But then again, that 24-hour mode is always a source of confusion. For v3.0, I was pondering to make fullCycle the default, but I decided against it. I think it was a mistake now.\r\n\r\n`getNoon()` and `getNadir()` have always been `@nullable`. The missing annotation was just kept undetected until I switched from JSR305 to SpotBugs annotations. `null` is returned if there is no noon/nadir within the next 24 hours (e.g. summer above the Arctic Circle). Yes, here we go again with the confusions caused by the fullCycle mode. `getNoon()` and `getNadir()` only consider the next 24 hours, irregarding of the fullCycle mode.\r\n\r\nThinking of it again, I think I will make fullCycle the default, and publish a v3.1 asap.","author_association":"OWNER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/shred/commons-suncalc/issues/comments/640179492/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"shred","id":505118,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNTExOA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/505118?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/shred","html_url":"https://github.com/shred","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shred/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shred/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shred/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shred/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shred/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shred/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shred/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shred/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shred/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/shred/commons-suncalc/issues/comments/640222624","html_url":"https://github.com/shred/commons-suncalc/issues/21#issuecomment-640222624","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/shred/commons-suncalc/issues/21","id":640222624,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY0MDIyMjYyNA==","user":{"login":"shred","id":505118,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNTExOA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/505118?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/shred","html_url":"https://github.com/shred","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shred/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shred/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shred/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shred/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shred/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shred/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shred/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shred/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shred/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-06-07T13:53:48Z","updated_at":"2020-06-07T13:53:48Z","body":"`fullCycle()` is the default in v3.1 now.
