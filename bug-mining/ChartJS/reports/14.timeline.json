know the problem but I don't know yet how to fix it. Essentially what happens is that initially the scale is in a unit like 'hours'. But then, the unit moves up to something like 'days'. When that happens, the tick is moved to the start of the new unit but the size of the scale in the underlying unit is not increased.\n\nFor instance, in the line-time-point-data.html sample file\n1. Starting point is initially '5PM'\n2. Shrinking the graph far enough leads to unit becoming 'days'\n3. The old and new graphs are still exactly 5 days wide, but that's the problem. The new graph is actually larger because the first tick was rounded to the start of the day and the last tick was rounded to the end of the day.
