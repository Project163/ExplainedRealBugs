but I think the legend item should contain a number in `lineWidth`, because you must use a number to draw the border box of legend (context2d of canvas restrictions, I guess).\r\n\r\nWhat do you think to set the \"min\" value of the object values (if `borderWidth` is an object in dataset options) to the `lineWidth` of legend item?\r\n\r\nI'm suggesting the \"min\" because the \"max\" could be too
