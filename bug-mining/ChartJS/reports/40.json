The same goes for the bootstrap panels next to it.\r\n\r\nI would expect this behavior to remain constant but when I used a reactjs search feature to filter out my list of modals and then reopen a modal the below behavior is encountered.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Current Behavior\r\n<!--- If describing a bug, tell us what happens instead of the expected behavior -->\r\n<!--- If suggesting a change/improvement, explain the difference from current behavior -->\r\nAfter filtering out the modals based on their name, the pie chart appears like so:\r\n![broken](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/29068308/27390071-461fb294-566e-11e7-8bb8-756f0915ee4e.PNG)\r\n![broken2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/29068308/27390078-4932b3a0-566e-11e7-9f7e-89f142c3b98c.PNG)\r\n\r\nThe pie chart will flicker between the half-pie and the small pie depending on which one has had a mouseover event most recently.\r\n\r\n## Possible Solution\r\n<!--- Not obligatory, but suggest a fix/reason for the bug, -->\r\n<!--- or ideas how to implement the addition or change -->\r\nFor now, the solution I found was to manually resize the canvas each time the modal is updated in Reactjs using `componentWillUpdate()`. Simply getting the canvas node and setting `canvas.height=height` and `canvas.width=width` works fine. I did this because the issue seems to be related to the responsive resizing returning a value of -30 for the dimensions of the canvas due to the canvas being in a collapsed modal element and then getting confused when it tries to resize from there. So simply changing this value manually before calling `new Chart( ... )` works to fix this bug. However this does result in blurry canvas in some situations.\r\n\r\n## Steps to Reproduce (for bugs)\r\n<!--- Provide a link to a live example, or an unambiguous set of steps to -->\r\n<!--- reproduce this bug. Include code to reproduce, if relevant -->\r\n\r\nBug would be hard to reproduce in a fiddle or something because it involves Reactjs.
