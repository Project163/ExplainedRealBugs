discussion from #2713.\n\n> In reference to my own needs and to #2435, this very slim patch (including its relevant documentation addition) adds a small option to line chart datasets (spanGaps) that allows users trying to graph sparse datasets to have lines between null entries drawn, rather than omitted.\n\nIf this isn't what you meant when discussing moving some of this to the controller, let me know and I'll fix it.\n\n**Tests**\n\nI fixed the tests by adding a very swift check in lineToNextPoint() in element.line. This was necessary because the tests--presumably adding points in a way that one might see in the wild--adds points manually, bypassing the line._model setup.\n\nMy options were to either alter the tests, thereby breaking potential functionality, or to add the quick check to lineToNextPoint(). I settled on the latter for backward compatibility's sake.\n\np.s. I fixed the tests in my context, but Travis keeps failing at the end without actually finding that any of the tests failed. The build on my fork fails, but [none of the individual tests fail](https://travis-ci.org/baublet/Chart.js/builds/135634395). Not sure what that's about?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/chartjs/Chart.js/issues/2721/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/chartjs/Chart.js/issues/2721/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":683963406,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50NjgzOTYzNDA2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/chartjs/Chart.js/issues/events/683963406","actor":{"login":"simonbrunel","id":3874900,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4NzQ5MDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3874900?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/simonbrunel","html_url":"https://github.com/simonbrunel","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/simonbrunel/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/simonbrunel/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/simonbrunel/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/simonbrunel/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/simonbrunel/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/simonbrunel/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/simonbrunel/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/simonbrunel/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/simonbrunel/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":"77357e57d6f5ae44ba10bf22b06219850df4df5f","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/chartjs/Chart.js/commits/77357e57d6f5ae44ba10bf22b06219850df4df5f","created_at":"2016-06-07T07:15:31Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":1442996605,"node_id":"MDE0OlVubGFiZWxlZEV2ZW50MTQ0Mjk5NjYwNQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/chartjs/Chart.js/issues/events/1442996605","actor":{"login":"benmccann","id":322311,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyMjMxMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/322311?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/benmccann","html_url":"https://github.com/benmccann","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benmccann/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benmccann/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benmccann/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benmccann/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benmccann/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benmccann/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benmccann/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benmccann/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benmccann/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"unlabeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-01-26T05:06:02Z","label":{"name":"type:
