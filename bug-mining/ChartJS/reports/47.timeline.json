Closes #7701 \r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/498419/97086959-401f5000-162f-11eb-8de6-5d8c4a0d9aa5.png)\r\n\r\nSupport for stacked bar charts is not something trivial to add, so it's not included in this PR. \r\nI tried looking into it, but we depend on borderSkipped for the implementation, and it doesn't work as expected for stacked bar charts: it skips a border in each rectangle from a stack, but we would need it to skip two borders for the middle rectangles and one border for the bottom of the stack.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOne of the visual tests was failing due to a small, imperceptible, antialiasing difference between `ctx.fillRect()` and `ctx.rect(); ctx.fill()` (tested on Chrome). The change was done for code consistency between rounded and non-rounded rectangles.\r\nI updated the fixture to match this. \r\nActual:\r\n![horizontal-borders-actual](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/498419/97086594-ddc55000-162c-11eb-83c5-feeb7cb9b852.png)\r\nExpected:\r\n![horizontal-borders-expected](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/498419/97086598-e3bb3100-162c-11eb-912e-6d94dadf0825.png)\r\nDiff:\r\nThe difference was found only in two places, so it's not something consistent, but probably caused by anitaliasing. For reference the diff is 1 px tall and has colors: `#cbcbcb` and `#cacaca`\r\n![horizontal-borders-diff](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/498419/97086580-c25a4500-162c-11eb-8edf-63e6403565eb.png)\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/chartjs/Chart.js/issues/7951/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/chartjs/Chart.js/issues/7951/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":3920892078,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MzkyMDg5MjA3OA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/chartjs/Chart.js/issues/events/3920892078","actor":{"login":"etimberg","id":6757853,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY3NTc4NTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6757853?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/etimberg","html_url":"https://github.com/etimberg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/etimberg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/etimberg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/etimberg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/etimberg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/etimberg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/etimberg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/etimberg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/etimberg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/etimberg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-10-26T14:05:25Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3920892226,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDM5MjA4OTIyMjY=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/chartjs/Chart.js/issues/events/3920892226","actor":{"login":"etimberg","id":6757853,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY3NTc4NTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6757853?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/etimberg","html_url":"https://github.com/etimberg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/etimberg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/etimberg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/etimberg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/etimberg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/etimberg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/etimberg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/etimberg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/etimberg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/etimberg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"495c35950c46d2b69b4b902bfe576e42895b63c0","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/chartjs/Chart.js/commits/495c35950c46d2b69b4b902bfe576e42895b63c0","created_at":"2020-10-26T14:05:26Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
