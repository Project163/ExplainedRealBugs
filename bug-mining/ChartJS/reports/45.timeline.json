essentially just clears any animation state from the element. It creates `_view` if it doesn't exist so that the element can be rendered and clears `_start`. When a chart is created new elements are actually updated twice. First in a \"reset\" configuration, then `pivot` is called on all the items to ensure that the animation system has the reset position as the start of the animation, then another update puts the elements in their final position so that the initial animation looks correct.\r\n\r\nI think the bug is somewhere else. I think the current tooltip code is mostly correct in that we should only call `pivot` after an `update` since there is potential for an animation at that point.\r\n\r\nOne thought is perhaps https://github.com/chartjs/Chart.js/blob/master/src/core/core.tooltip.js#L853 is too simplistic. Maybe we need to sort the array in some way so that the comparison is true when the items are the same but the order is different. The downside is that if the order does change and the user wants that the tooltip wouldn't render. \r\n\r\nI'll try and do some debugging on this tonight and see where that gets me","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/chartjs/Chart.js/issues/comments/347165745/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"etimberg","id":6757853,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY3NTc4NTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6757853?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/etimberg","html_url":"https://github.com/etimberg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/etimberg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/etimberg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/etimberg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/etimberg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/etimberg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/etimberg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/etimberg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/etimberg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/etimberg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/chartjs/Chart.js/issues/comments/347173111","html_url":"https://github.com/chartjs/Chart.js/issues/4989#issuecomment-347173111","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/chartjs/Chart.js/issues/4989","id":347173111,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM0NzE3MzExMQ==","user":{"login":"jcopperfield","id":33193571,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzMTkzNTcx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/33193571?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jcopperfield","html_url":"https://github.com/jcopperfield","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jcopperfield/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jcopperfield/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jcopperfield/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jcopperfield/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jcopperfield/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jcopperfield/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jcopperfield/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jcopperfield/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jcopperfield/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-11-27T12:52:57Z","updated_at":"2017-11-27T12:52:57Z","body":"@etimberg an error on L853 cannot be the case, since the `!changed` is called.
