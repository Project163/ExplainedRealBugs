Expected behavior\n\nI expected to be able to import `Chart` from the CDN url https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/Chart.js/4.4.0/chart.js\n\n### Current behavior\n\n`Uncaught (in promise)

It'll error out.\n\n### Possible solution\n\n_No response_\n\n### Context\n\nhttps://www.chartjs.org/docs/latest/getting-started/installation.html suggests that if you don't want to use npm (for instance, you're working on a \"classic\" web page that's just static HTML, CSS, and JS) you can use one of several CDNs with CDNJS listed as first option, so that's what folks will most likely go for. \r\n\r\nhttps://www.chartjs.org/docs/latest/getting-started/integration.html then teaches people that it's an ES module so `import` works out of the box, and so we run into a problem because instead it errors out.\n\n### chart.js version\n\n4.4.0\n\n### Browser name and version\n\nn/a\n\n### Link to your project\n\nn/a","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/chartjs/Chart.js/issues/11592/reactions","total_count":10,"+1":9,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":1},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/chartjs/Chart.js/issues/11592/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
