This only happens when using the hoverOffset option.\n\n### Reproducible sample\n\nhttps://jsfiddle.net/5rnyo4qc/12/\n\n### Optional extra steps/info to reproduce\n\nJust pass an array with a 385 value at any index while the rest of the values are 0 like [0,0,385,0] and use hoverOffset and you'll see the bug when you hover.\n\n### Possible solution\n\n_No response_\n\n### Context\n\n_No response_\n\n### chart.js version\n\nv3.9.1\n\n### Browser name and version\n\nChrome v106.0.5249.119\n\n### Link to your project\n\n_No response_","closed_by":{"login":"kurkle","id":27971921,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3OTcxOTIx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/27971921?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kurkle","html_url":"https://github.com/kurkle","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kurkle/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kurkle/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kurkle/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kurkle/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kurkle/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kurkle/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kurkle/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kurkle/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kurkle/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/chartjs/Chart.js/issues/10801/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/chartjs/Chart.js/issues/10801/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
