  <-- this demo illustrates my problem\r\n\r\nSo I have multiple graphs and using one graph as a parent graph for inheriting the same patterns. And one thing that differs from all the graphs are the Y axis custom values. On some I want to return custom values and on some the original ones. With the custom one everything works as expected, but with the original ones on occasion when I only have 0 and 1 values I get some bizarre middle values, which are not there and ofc I don't want to display them.\r\n\r\n## Expected Behavior\r\nWell I should only see 0 and 1 values or at least tell me how to achieve this?\r\n## Current Behavior\r\nThe opposite\r\n\r\n## Environment\r\n<!--- Include as many relevant details about the environment you experienced the bug in -->\r\n* Chart.js version: 2.7\r\n* Browser name and version: Newest Ubuntu chrome\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/chartjs/Chart.js/issues/5079/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/chartjs/Chart.js/issues/5079/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":1404985476,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDE0MDQ5ODU0NzY=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/chartjs/Chart.js/issues/events/1404985476","actor":{"login":"yofreke","id":536581,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNjU4MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/536581?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yofreke","html_url":"https://github.com/yofreke","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yofreke/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yofreke/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yofreke/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yofreke/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yofreke/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yofreke/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yofreke/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yofreke/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yofreke/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"71e61eecc60661f7c47a18ec009f135b854b68a3","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yofreke/Chart.js/commits/71e61eecc60661f7c47a18ec009f135b854b68a3","created_at":"2017-12-30T02:42:55Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":4671342529,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDQ2NzEzNDI1Mjk=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/chartjs/Chart.js/issues/events/4671342529","actor":{"login":"exwm","id":47549335,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3NTQ5MzM1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47549335?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/exwm","html_url":"https://github.com/exwm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exwm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exwm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exwm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exwm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exwm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exwm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exwm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exwm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exwm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"170cdc75d0430c5fd5c176b35132254b91a35e8a","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/exwm/Chart.js/commits/170cdc75d0430c5fd5c176b35132254b91a35e8a","created_at":"2021-04-30T19:03:06Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
