When I set min (or max) parameter to yAxes options in line chart, data which less than min value (or greater than max value) is sticked out from drawing area, and labels are overlayed with lines. It also occurs in bar chart.\n- jsfiddle (line chart): https://jsfiddle.net/koheis612/j4prbq5b/0/\n- jsfiddle (bar chart): https://jsfiddle.net/koheis612/j4prbq5b/1/\n\nI know when I set suggestedMin options to yAxes, y-axis labels are auto-scaled. But I want to hide data less than specified value. Is that a bug or can I get any solutions?\n## Expected Behavior\n\n<!--- If you're describing a bug, tell us what should happen -->\n\n<!--- If you're suggesting a change/improvement, tell us how it should work -->\n\nValues less than min or greater than max value are not displayed from drawing area, and labels are not overlayed with data.\n## Current Behavior\n\n<!--- If describing a bug, tell us what happens instead of the expected behavior -->\n\n<!--- If suggesting a change/improvement, explain the difference from current behavior -->\n- linechart: https://jsfiddle.net/koheis612/j4prbq5b/0/\n- barchart: https://jsfiddle.net/koheis612/j4prbq5b/0/\n## Steps to Reproduce (for bugs)\n\n<!--- Provide a link to a live example, or an unambiguous set of steps to -->\n\n<!--- reproduce this bug.
