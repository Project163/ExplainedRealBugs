I don't know if this is also affecting other types of chart.\r\n\r\nThe issue was already reported in #3799, but was closed because nobody presented a test case.\r\n\r\n## Expected Behavior\r\nThe provided function should be called when the mouse hovers a segment of the chart.\r\n\r\n## Current Behavior\r\nNothing happens on hover, but the onClick event is working. \r\n\r\n## Steps to Reproduce (for bugs)\r\nWhen hovering over on a segment, the tooltip shows but the onHover function is not called.\r\nWhen clicking a segment, the onClick function is called.\r\nCodepen: https://codepen.io/anon/pen/ZKNGEQ\r\n\r\n## Context\r\nI was trying to expand (increase outerRadius) a slice of the chart when hovering. If necessary, I can provide a gist with the expansion working for the onClick event.\r\n\r\n## Environment\r\n* Chart.js version: 2.6.0\r\n* Browser name and version: Chrome 58.0.3029.110 (64-bit)\r\n* Operating System: macOS Sierra 10.12.5\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"etimberg","id":6757853,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY3NTc4NTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6757853?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/etimberg","html_url":"https://github.com/etimberg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/etimberg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/etimberg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/etimberg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/etimberg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/etimberg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/etimberg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/etimberg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/etimberg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/etimberg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/chartjs/Chart.js/issues/4296/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/chartjs/Chart.js/issues/4296/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
