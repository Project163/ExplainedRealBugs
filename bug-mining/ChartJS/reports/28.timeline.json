it's possible that I'm misunderstanding the purpose of logarithmic scales.  \n\nHere's the problem I'm trying to address.  I'm showing a bar chart that displays the number of courses added each month.  Some months, thousands of courses are imported (such is the case when we provision a new user).  Most months, only a few courses are added.  Some months, no courses are added.  If one bar in the chart reflects that 10,000 courses were added and all the other bars reflect only a few courses were added, the slow months are all nearly zero-height.  I was hoping to use logarithmic scales to emphasize the differences in the slow months.\n\nHere's an example where the slow months appear equal in height and zero-height:\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/2644202/16956682/ff81c5da-4d9e-11e6-90e9-d116363213fb.png)\n\nhttp://codepen.io/barsh/pen/xOYQWR\n\nI was hoping logarithmic scales
