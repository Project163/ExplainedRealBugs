#10801\r\n\r\nThe root cause was bad behavior when floating-point arithmetic _just_ pushed a single slice into self-overlap territory and `drawFullCircleBorders` does not account for offset like `pathArc` does, resulting in borders drawn in the wrong location. This PR updates `drawBorder` to rely on `pathArc` instead, although I suspect further improvements could fully unify everything and draw arcs and borders together.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/chartjs/Chart.js/issues/10806/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/chartjs/Chart.js/issues/10806/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":7797259434,"node_id":"CE_lADOAIbxo85UHj-gzwAAAAHQwLyq","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/chartjs/Chart.js/issues/events/7797259434","actor":{"login":"kurkle","id":27971921,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3OTcxOTIx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/27971921?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kurkle","html_url":"https://github.com/kurkle","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kurkle/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kurkle/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kurkle/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kurkle/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kurkle/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kurkle/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kurkle/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kurkle/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kurkle/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-11-12T19:47:10Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":7797259523,"node_id":"REFE_lADOAIbxo85UHj-gzwAAAAHQwL0D","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/chartjs/Chart.js/issues/events/7797259523","actor":{"login":"kurkle","id":27971921,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3OTcxOTIx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/27971921?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kurkle","html_url":"https://github.com/kurkle","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kurkle/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kurkle/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kurkle/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kurkle/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kurkle/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kurkle/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kurkle/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kurkle/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kurkle/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"89487501b6d05502da0fd57ee6233bb35d07716c","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/chartjs/Chart.js/commits/89487501b6d05502da0fd57ee6233bb35d07716c","created_at":"2022-11-12T19:47:16Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
