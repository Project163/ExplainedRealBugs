lot of cleanup of the radial scale. I moved a lot of functionality into private functions.\r\n\r\n## Issues Fixed\r\n* When the scale was user for the polar area graph, the scale didn't use the full available area because it tried to fit the point labels (used for radar chart) even though non existed. \r\n* The point labels can now have multiple lines of text. Resolves #3225 \r\n\r\n![screen shot 2016-11-19 at 11 02 36 pm](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/6757853/20460303/b7820bd6-aeac-11e6-8548-614449478eb8.png)\r\n\r\n## Testing Done\r\n* Unit tests run\r\n* Tested the polar area and radar charts manually\r\n\r\n## Changed Behaviour\r\n* the `getIndexAngle` method no longer subtracts 90 degrees since we added it back almost all of the time.
