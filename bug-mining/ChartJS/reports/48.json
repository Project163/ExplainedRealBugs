Expected Behavior\r\nI have got a bar chart with the following configuration:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\n{\r\n    type: 'bar',\r\n    data: {\r\n      labels: [\"Jan\", \"Feb\", \"Mar\", \"Apr\", \"May\"],\r\n\t  datasets: [{\r\n\t  \tlabel: 'dataset',\r\n\t  \tborderWidth: {top: 2, left: 2, right: 2},\r\n\t  \tborderColor: \"red\",\r\n\t  \tdata: [120, 23, 24, 45, 51]\r\n\t  }]\r\n    },\r\n    options: {\r\n      responsive: true,\r\n      legend: {\r\n         display: true\r\n      },\r\n   }\r\n} \r\n```\r\n\r\nI'm expecting to have a chart with the legend and the `borderWidth` that I set.\r\n\r\n## Current Behavior\r\nWith above configuration, there is the following exception:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nUncaught TypeError: can't convert lineWidth to number\r\n    drawLegendBox https://www.chartjs.org/dist/master/chart.js:10461\r\n    draw https://www.chartjs.org/dist/master/chart.js:10543\r\n    draw https://www.chartjs.org/dist/master/chart.js:10525\r\n    draw

don't set the object to`boderWidth`, it works.\r\nIt seems the `borderWidth` as object is not managed by legend.\r\n\r\n## Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\nCodepen: https://codepen.io/stockinail/pen/BazQKQr\r\n\r\n## Environment\r\n* Chart.js version: master/dist\r\n* Browser name and version: 81.0.2
