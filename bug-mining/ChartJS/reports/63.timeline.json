There should be a logic [here](https://github.com/chartjs/Chart.js/compare/master...finnegantdewitt:Chart.js:master#diff-5aa5d901b73828c73df9a95ae86edea43ecf5352650b09b060337f39dd8df4a7L581) that if the min is set below 0 then this tick should be displayed. I am not so sure about using `tickOpts.autoSkip`. Something like this:\r\n````javascript\r\nif (index !== 0 || (index === 0 && this.min < 0)) {\r\n     offset = this.getDistanceFromCenterForValue(tick.value);\r\n     const context = this.getContext(index);\r\n     const optsAtIndex = grid.setContext(context);\r\n     const optsAtIndexBorder = border.setContext(context);\r\n\r\n     drawRadiusLine(this, optsAtIndex, offset, labelCount, optsAtIndexBorder);\r\n````\r\nCan you give it a try and see if there is no errors (for example from `this.getDistanceFromCenterForValue(tick.value)`)?\r\n\r\n> I've made a fix for it in my own forked repo, but find it unlikely that they will merge the pull request because it may break other people's projects. \r\n\r\nThat is why we use github and versioning bro! \r\nDon't be shy and create a merge request (just test it correctly and give my version a try).
