using charts from chart.js with bootstrap carousel. Sometimes the charts go from this [pie chart working correctly](http://i.imgur.com/gPoci3r.png) to [pie chart not working correctly](http://i.imgur.com/GBJjpkr.png). The charts get distorted for some reason, and whenever a chart is distorted and I make the browser window bigger or smaller using the mouse by dragging, the chart goes back to its correct working state which is strange. This only happens sometimes but it is still a problem that needs to be solved. The problems seems to occur more frequently when the browser window isn't fully expanded. \r\n\r\nIt might be also helpful to know that I have two charts on 5 different carousel pages, and every 5 seconds it moves from one page to the next. Weirdly enough, sometimes only the charts on one slide of the carousel get distorted and the others are fine, but its appears to be random which charts get distorted. Sometimes its charts on one page and other times its charts on many pages.\r\n\r\nCheck it out here.\r\nhttp://178.62.63.252/\r\n\r\nI just noticed that the charts width = 792 and height = 792 when working correctly and when its distorted that changes to width = -60 and height = -60, why would that happen?\r\n\r\n## Steps to Reproduce \r\nIts difficult to reproduce but, open this in your browser (http://178.62.63.252/), keep it open for a while and you will see pie charts starting to get distorted, also note that changing the browser window size will make the problem go away. I think the problem is more likely to occur when the browser window isn't fully expanded. As far as I know it occurs in Google chrome and safari, I haven't tried any other browsers.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Here is my code:**\r\n```\r\n<div class=\"container-fluid\">\r\n    <div id=\"myCarousel\" class=\"carousel slide\">\r\n\r\n        <div class=\"navbar navbar-default visible-xs bg-5\" role=\"navigation\">\r\n            <div class=\"navbar-header\">\r\n                <button type=\"button\" class=\"navbar-toggle\" data-toggle=\"collapse\" data-target=\"#nav-pillz\">\r\n                    <span class=\"sr-only\">Toggle navigation</span>\r\n                    <span class=\"icon-bar\"></span>\r\n                    <span class=\"icon-bar\"></span>\r\n                    <span class=\"icon-bar\"></span>\r\n                </button>\r\n            </div>\r\n        </div>\r\n\r\n        <div class=\"collapse navbar-collapse\" id=\"nav-pillz\">\r\n            <ul class=\"nav nav-pills nav-justified\">\r\n                <li data-target=\"#myCarousel\" data-slide-to=\"0\" class=\"active\"><a href=\"#\">Page A</a></li>\r\n                <li data-target=\"#myCarousel\" data-slide-to=\"1\"><a href=\"#\">Page B</a></li>\r\n                <li data-target=\"#myCarousel\" data-slide-to=\"2\"><a href=\"#\">Page C</a></li>\r\n                <li data-target=\"#myCarousel\" data-slide-to=\"3\"><a href=\"#\">Page D</a></li>\r\n                <li data-target=\"#myCarousel\" data-slide-to=\"4\"><a href=\"#\">Page E</a></li>\r\n            </ul>\r\n        </div>\r\n```\r\n\r\n**The first item of the carousel with two pie charts inside(the other items are the same):**\r\n```\r\n<div class=\"carousel-inner\">\r\n<div class=\"item active\">\r\n    <div class=\"row bg-6\">\r\n        <div class=\"col-sm-1 col-md-1 col-lg-1\"></div>\r\n        <div class=\"col-sm-4 col-md-4 col-lg-4\">\r\n            <br>\r\n            <canvas id=\"pieChartA\" ></canvas>\r\n            <br>\r\n        </div>\r\n        <div class=\"col-sm-2 col-md-2 col-lg-2\"></div>\r\n        <div class=\"col-sm-4 col-md-4 col-lg-4\">\r\n            <br>\r\n            <canvas id=\"pieChartB\" ></canvas>\r\n            <br>\r\n        </div>\r\n        <div class=\"col-sm-1 col-md-1 col-lg-1\"></div>\r\n    </div>\r\n</div>\r\n``` \r\n\r\n**Chart js javascript file:**\r\n\r\n```\r\n$(document).ready( function() {\r\n\r\nvar ctx = document.getElementById(\"pieChartA\");\r\nvar myPieChart = new Chart(ctx,{\r\n    type: 'pie',\r\n    data: {\r\n        labels: [\"Red\",\"Blue\",\"Yellow\"],\r\n        datasets: [{\r\n            data: [30, 15, 55],\r\n            backgroundColor: [\r\n                \"#FF6384\",\r\n                \"#36A2EB\",\r\n                \"#FFCE56\"\r\n            ],\r\n            hoverBackgroundColor: [\r\n                \"#FF6384\",\r\n                \"#36A2EB\",\r\n                \"#FFCE56\"\r\n            ]\r\n        }]},\r\n        options: {\r\n            animation : false\r\n        }\r\n    });
