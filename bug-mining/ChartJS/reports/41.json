Expected Behavior\r\n\r\nFill area should be drawn inside the chart area.\r\n\r\n## Current Behavior\r\n\r\nCurrently, fill area is drawn outside the chart area if the axis has `ticks.min`, `ticks.max` or `elements.line.capBezierPoints` set to false, and a data point exists outside the scale.\r\n\r\n## Possible Solution\r\n\r\nClip the chart area before filler plugin draws.\r\n\r\n## Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\nSee: https://jsfiddle.net/nagix/hwe2rva2/\r\n\r\n## Environment\r\n\r\nChart.js version: 2.6.0\r\nBrowser name and version: Chrome 59.0.3071.109, FireFox 54.0, Safari
