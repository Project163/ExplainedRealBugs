am looking into this one. \r\n\r\n### Sequence of action as follows: \r\n\r\n1. **HandleEvent** \r\n2. **me.update**\r\n3. **trigger callbacks** [0] \r\n\r\n[0] : https://github.com/chartjs/Chart.js/blob/master/src/core/core.tooltip.js#L508-L512\r\n\r\n## Possible Solution: \r\n\r\nWhat I was thinking was to add a var `_activeIndex` to keep track of the index of data of first active Element. Then trigger callback depending on its state (changed or unchanged). \r\n\r\nI assumed if first active Element index (`chartInstance._active[0]._index`) has changed then all other active Elements has changed as well (for example, multi dataset charts). I believe the tooltip active element is obtained via nearest proximity. \r\n\r\n\r\n**Sample:**\r\n\r\n```javascript \r\n/**\r\n * Helper method to determine whether activeElement data has changed\r\n */\r\nfunction activeIndexChanged(chartInstance) {\r\n    var predicate = true;\r\n    /* update title by default, unless activeIndex are the same  */\r\n    if ((chartInstance._activeIndex === chartInstance._active[0]._index)) {\r\n        predicate = false;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    // Update the activeIndex for next Check\r\n    chartInstance._activeIndex = chartInstance._active[0]._index;\r\n\r\n    return predicate;\r\n}\r\n\r\n...\r\n\r\n\r\n/** example usage */\r\n\r\nif (activeIndexChanged(me)) {\r\n    model.title = me.getTitle(tooltipItems, data); \r\n} \r\n```\r\nThe other callbacks (**afterBody**, **beforeTitle**...) will need to this check as well.\r\n\r\n@simonbrunel, @etimberg please let me know if theres any concerns with this possible solution.

have problems with the performance in Chrome (56.0.2924.87) on windows 10. When displaying maybe 10 charts in a page and hovering over a datapoint the tooltip animates very slowly from the last selected point to the new. It's so slow that you get bored and the cpu fan on my pc starts. The pc should be about twice as fast as my old mac. In Firefox on Windows and in Chrome on mac hoovering tooltips is fast and smooth. I have enabled gpu ignore in chrome because I saw a few issues, but it didn't help.  Anyone have an idea how to fix this issue?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/chartjs/Chart.js/issues/3857/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/chartjs/Chart.js/issues/3857/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":946714564,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDk0NjcxNDU2NA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/chartjs/Chart.js/issues/events/946714564","actor":{"login":"Jareechang","id":9851316,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk4NTEzMTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9851316?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jareechang","html_url":"https://github.com/Jareechang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jareechang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jareechang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jareechang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jareechang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jareechang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jareechang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jareechang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jareechang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jareechang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"863afc5c65500f31f1b710144023da7ecb0e640a","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Jareechang/Chart.js/commits/863afc5c65500f31f1b710144023da7ecb0e640a","created_at":"2017-02-02T16:30:24Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":958118372,"node_id":"MDE1Ok1pbGVzdG9uZWRFdmVudDk1ODExODM3Mg==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/chartjs/Chart.js/issues/events/958118372","actor":{"login":"etimberg","id":6757853,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY3NTc4NTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6757853?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/etimberg","html_url":"https://github.com/etimberg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/etimberg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/etimberg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/etimberg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/etimberg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/etimberg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/etimberg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/etimberg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/etimberg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/etimberg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"milestoned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2017-02-10T23:51:11Z","milestone":{"title":"Version 2.6"},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
