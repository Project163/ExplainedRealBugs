But these symbols are not represented in the tooltip.\r\n\r\n## Possible Implementation\r\nAllow an option in the tool tip section to enable the use of symbols passed through the datasets.\r\n\r\nI think the only way atm to do this is to create a custom tooltip which is a lot of work only to get the symbol because everything else doesnt need to be changed.","closed_by":{"login":"kurkle","id":27971921,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3OTcxOTIx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/27971921?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kurkle","html_url":"https://github.com/kurkle","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kurkle/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kurkle/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kurkle/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kurkle/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kurkle/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kurkle/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kurkle/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kurkle/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kurkle/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/chartjs/Chart.js/issues/7774/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/chartjs/Chart.js/issues/7774/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
