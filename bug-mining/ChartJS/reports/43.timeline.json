that particular graph a workaround (not fix) is to specify an empty y axes scale label.\r\n\r\n```js\r\n\"yAxes\": [{\r\n        \"stacked\": true,\r\n        \"scaleLabel\": {\r\n          \"display\": true,\r\n          \"labelString\": \"\"\r\n        },\r\n        \"ticks\": {\r\n          \"fontSize\": 10,\r\n          \"beginAtZero\": true\r\n        }\r\n      }]\r\n```\r\n\r\nThat adds enough padding to make room for the ticks that are being truncated.  Still a bug though.  If a *real* scaleLabel is used, it ends up overlapping with the tick labels.  There may be some better way to explicitly add padding to the tick labels, but that would still not be a fix for the problem.  The initial calculation of the yAxes tick column width (using longestText) for range 0 … 3 (beginAtZero to maximum 3) is less than the final column width, once the starting integer tick values are converted to floating.\r\n\r\nI do not know where the extra ticks are added, but I *assume* that once the initial layout was done, chart.js decided it wanted more than 4 yAxes ticks.  The change to use 0.5 step size causes the tick length to be longer than the initial maximum calculation.","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/chartjs/Chart.js/issues/comments/312144667/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"mMerlin","id":918823,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkxODgyMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/918823?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mMerlin","html_url":"https://github.com/mMerlin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mMerlin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mMerlin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mMerlin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mMerlin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mMerlin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mMerlin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mMerlin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mMerlin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mMerlin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/chartjs/Chart.js/issues/comments/317998250","html_url":"https://github.com/chartjs/Chart.js/issues/4441#issuecomment-317998250","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/chartjs/Chart.js/issues/4441","id":317998250,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMxNzk5ODI1MA==","user":{"login":"sylfabre","id":3177556,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxNzc1NTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3177556?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sylfabre","html_url":"https://github.com/sylfabre","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sylfabre/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sylfabre/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sylfabre/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sylfabre/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sylfabre/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sylfabre/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sylfabre/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sylfabre/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sylfabre/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-07-26T09:19:30Z","updated_at":"2017-07-26T09:19:30Z","body":"A workaround that works for me:\r\n```\r\nyAxes: [{\r\n\tticks: {\r\n\t\tmin: 0,\r\n\t\tstepSize: 1\r\n\t}\r\n}]\r\n```\r\n\r\n@mMerlin I _assumed_ the same about the 0.5 step.

Some if it should be common, and current symptoms are leading me to believe that part of the problem there is also changes between initial layout calculations, and actual final size of the text.
