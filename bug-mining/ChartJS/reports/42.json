But there are not much options since the positioner does not get much information.\r\n\r\nActually I want to make an custom/extended \"average\" but check the canvas size and bind the tooltip to be always inside the canvas. But all we get are the point-positions and the position of the event/cursor.\r\n\r\nThat's why i suggest to call the positioneers in the scope \"me\".\r\nhttps://github.com/chartjs/Chart.js/blob/v2.7.0/src/core/core.tooltip.js#L498\r\nThis one..\r\n```javascript\r\ntooltipPosition = Chart.Tooltip.positioners[opts.position](active, me._eventPosition);\r\n```\r\nshould now be this one..\r\n```javascript\r\ntooltipPosition = Chart.Tooltip.positioners[opts.position].call(me, active, me._eventPosition);\r\n```\r\nIn the same change the second argument can become deprecated.\r\n\r\nAre there any reasons I have not thought about which could break sth? Any other recommendations?\r\nIf you think this change would improve chart.js I would make a pull request for it.\r\n\r\nBest,\r\nFlorian","closed_by":{"login":"etimberg","id":6757853,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY3NTc4NTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6757853?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/etimberg","html_url":"https://github.com/etimberg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/etimberg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/etimberg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/etimberg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/etimberg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/etimberg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/etimberg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/etimberg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/etimberg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/etimberg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/chartjs/Chart.js/issues/4772/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/chartjs/Chart.js/issues/4772/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
