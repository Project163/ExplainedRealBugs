Much thanks to chart.js for enabling us to do that :) . We allow users to chose what dimension they would like to see on the x-axis. For example a simple chart would be \"Sum of Revenue grouped by Country and Subscription Tier\". In that case users could choose to put Country or Subscription Tier as the x-axis. The way we have implemented this is by making extensive use of the `parsing` key in the dataset controllers. When a user changes the x-axis, I don't need to reformat the data at all, all I need to do is update the `parsing.xAxisKey` and `xAxisID` field on the dataset and it works wonderfully. However, I now need to properly account for null value spacing in these charts, and using parsing with multiple dimensions, and skipNulls appears to not work. I really appreciate any help or guidance you can provide.\r\n\r\n### chart.js version\r\n\r\nv4.4.2\r\n\r\n### Browser name and version\r\n\r\nChrome 122.0.6261.112\r\n\r\n### Link to your project\r\n\r\n_No response_","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/chartjs/Chart.js/issues/11717/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/chartjs/Chart.js/issues/11717/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
