Looking at line 93-49 (ish) of the following file:\n\nhttps://github.com/nnnick/Chart.js/blob/master/src/Chart.Doughnut.js\n\nYou can see that the issue is type coercion.\n\n```\naddData : function(segment, atIndex, silent){\n    var index = atIndex || this.segments.length;\n```\n\nIf the argument atIndex is zero, type coercion will case the integer to be converted to a boolean with the value of false.\n\nThe solution is fairly straight forward. I would like to make a pull request for this.\n\n```\nvar index = atIndex !== undefined ? atIndex : this.segments.length;\n```\n\nIf there is a stylistic approach you would prefer, please let me know.\n","closed_by":{"login":"etimberg","id":6757853,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY3NTc4NTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6757853?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/etimberg","html_url":"https://github.com/etimberg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/etimberg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/etimberg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/etimberg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/etimberg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/etimberg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/etimberg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/etimberg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/etimberg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/etimberg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/chartjs/Chart.js/issues/1309/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/chartjs/Chart.js/issues/1309/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
