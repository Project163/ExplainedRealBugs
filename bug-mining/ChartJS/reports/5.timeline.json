I did this because it blew up the tests, and I didn't feel comfortable changing the test output and breaking people's setups. (But if you want me to preserve that 11-tick default behavior, it should be easy for me to do.)\n\nI also added maxTicksLimit to scale docs, and some contributing notes.\n\n:+1: \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/chartjs/Chart.js/issues/1863/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/chartjs/Chart.js/issues/1863/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/chartjs/Chart.js/issues/comments/169785834","html_url":"https://github.com/chartjs/Chart.js/issues/1859#issuecomment-169785834","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/chartjs/Chart.js/issues/1859","id":169785834,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE2OTc4NTgzNA==","user":{"login":"etimberg","id":6757853,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY3NTc4NTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6757853?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/etimberg","html_url":"https://github.com/etimberg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/etimberg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/etimberg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/etimberg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/etimberg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/etimberg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/etimberg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/etimberg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/etimberg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/etimberg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-01-07T19:44:09Z","updated_at":"2016-01-07T19:44:09Z","body":"Merged #1863\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/chartjs/Chart.js/issues/comments/169785834/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"etimberg","id":6757853,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY3NTc4NTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6757853?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/etimberg","html_url":"https://github.com/etimberg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/etimberg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/etimberg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/etimberg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/etimberg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/etimberg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/etimberg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/etimberg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/etimberg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/etimberg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":508648570,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50NTA4NjQ4NTcw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/chartjs/Chart.js/issues/events/508648570","actor":{"login":"etimberg","id":6757853,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY3NTc4NTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6757853?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/etimberg","html_url":"https://github.com/etimberg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/etimberg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/etimberg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/etimberg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/etimberg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/etimberg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/etimberg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/etimberg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/etimberg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/etimberg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2016-01-07T19:44:09Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
