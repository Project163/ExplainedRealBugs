[\r\n            {...} ,           // this is a bar\r\n            {fill: '+1'},      // this is a line\r\n            {fill: false},      // this is another line\r\n        ]\r\n    }\r\n})\r\n```\r\nbut I found the fill didn't start from index zero, \r\n![](http://i65.tinypic.com/15dmp29.png)\r\n\r\nBut in a lines only chart, the fill worked as expected, starting from index 0.
