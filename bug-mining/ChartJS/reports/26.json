thank you very much for the great work.\n\nThe documentation seems confusing to me.\nFor example, line chart\n\n```\nvar myLineChart = Chart.Line(ctx, {\n    data: data,\n    options: options\n});\n```\n\nline chart data structure (http://www.chartjs.org/docs/#line-chart-data-structure) refers to an structure (dataset) that is within a `datasets` array of `data` field, but the title makes me think that this structure is chart data instead of each dataset of chart, so i think something like\n\n```\nvar myLineChart = Chart.Line(ctx, {\n    data: {\n        label: \"My First dataset\",\n        fill: false,\n        lineTension: 0.1,\n        backgroundColor: \"rgba(75,192,192,0.4)\",\n        borderColor: \"rgba(75,192,192,1)\",\n        borderCapStyle: 'butt',\n        borderDash: [],\n        borderDashOffset: 0.0,\n        borderJoinStyle: 'miter',\n        pointBorderColor: \"rgba(75,192,192,1)\",\n        pointBackgroundColor: \"#fff\",\n        pointBorderWidth: 1,\n        pointHoverRadius: 5,\n        pointHoverBackgroundColor: \"rgba(75,192,192,1)\",\n        pointHoverBorderColor: \"rgba(220,220,220,1)\",\n        pointHoverBorderWidth: 2,\n        pointRadius: 1,\n        pointHitRadius: 10,\n        data: [65, 59, 80, 81, 56, 55, 40],\n        spanGaps: \n    },\n    options: options\n});\n```\n\nuntil i see an example data object below.\nI know this is specified in Chart Data (http://www.chartjs.org/docs/#chart-configuration-chart-data) but is more confusing at first look until you get used to this (many things with same name).\n\nIt would be better to change the title \"Data Structure\" to something like 'Dataset Structure\"?\n\nThanks.\n","closed_by":{"login":"etimberg","id":6757853,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY3NTc4NTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6757853?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/etimberg","html_url":"https://github.com/etimberg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/etimberg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/etimberg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/etimberg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/etimberg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/etimberg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/etimberg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/etimberg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/etimberg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/etimberg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/chartjs/Chart.js/issues/3046/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/chartjs/Chart.js/issues/3046/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
