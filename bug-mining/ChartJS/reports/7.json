this is a stupid question, but using Chart.js with Moment and multiple Series, I sometimes do get `labelMoment is undefined`, which can easily be fixed via:\n\n``` js\n    getPixelForValue: function(value, index, datasetIndex, includeOffset) {\n            var labelMoment = this.getLabelMoment(datasetIndex, index);\n      if (labelMoment) {\n```\n\nin line https://github.com/nnnick/Chart.js/blob/v2.0-dev/src/scales/scale.time.js#L269.\n\nWhat do you think?\n","closed_by":{"login":"etimberg","id":6757853,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY3NTc4NTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6757853?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/etimberg","html_url":"https://github.com/etimberg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/etimberg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/etimberg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/etimberg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/etimberg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/etimberg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/etimberg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/etimberg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/etimberg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/etimberg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/chartjs/Chart.js/issues/2009/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/chartjs/Chart.js/issues/2009/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
