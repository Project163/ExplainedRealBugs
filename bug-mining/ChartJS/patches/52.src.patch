 The `data` property of a dataset can be passed in various formats. By default, that `data` is parsed using the associated chart type and scales.
 
+If the `labels` property of the main `data` property is used, it has to contain the same amount of elements as the dataset with the most values. These labels are used to label the index axis (default x axes). The values for the labels have to be provided in an array.
