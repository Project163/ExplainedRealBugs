At least it did for our project (https://github.com/softwerkskammer/Agora)\n\nWe had to move some mixins up or down inside the mixing files to make them work again. I couldn't really figure out why.\n\nhttps://github.com/softwerkskammer/Agora/commit/cba26681c33ac2fb47ff80cb2c98d6b273db4a7b is a version that will not run with jade 1.2. It will fail because it does not resolve \"loginMenu\" in line 11 of https://github.com/softwerkskammer/Agora/blob/master/views/layoutComponents.jade\n\nMaybe this bit of information helps figure it out.\n\nCheers!\nAndreas\n","closed_by":{"login":"ForbesLindesay","id":1260646,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNjA2NDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1260646?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ForbesLindesay","html_url":"https://github.com/ForbesLindesay","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ForbesLindesay/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ForbesLindesay/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ForbesLindesay/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ForbesLindesay/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ForbesLindesay/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ForbesLindesay/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ForbesLindesay/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ForbesLindesay/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ForbesLindesay/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pugjs/pug/issues/1435/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pugjs/pug/issues/1435/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
