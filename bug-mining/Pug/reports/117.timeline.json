it's just arbitrary, though if were allowing CoffeeScript type interpolation, then maybe it could be `#(` `)`, `#[` `]`, the syntax isn't so important, it's more about the feature.\n\n``` jade\n  .tip

+1 on this. Having to split the code over multiple lines just to get some HTML in there is the only thing that really bothers about jade's syntax.\n\n> Also, the first example, the space after 'See' is important yet theres no way to tell whether it's there or not, whereas you can in the second.\n\nThat's also a good point. I have those invisible spaces at the end of line all over the place. Its not clear that they're there, or why they're there for. When I started using jade, I instinctively removed those end of line spaces because I forgot they're actually needed... even tho I put them there to begin with. And programmers that I work with also occasionally remove them.

language.\n\nJust look at javascript for example, it is pretty easy to write bad code in such a versatile language, but I would hate to have features stripped to attempt to make it conform to one standard.\n\nThere are many examples, where inline jade snippets would make the code more readable and maintainable.\n\nI would like to see inline snippets implemented, and explain that it is bad

Is it normal for Jade to render inline elements as text?\n\nExample:\n\n```\n:markdown\n  ## Foo\n  Extract from `<cite>`Pandora’s Star`</cite>` by Peter F. Hamilton\n```\n\nOutput:\n\n```\nExtract from `<cite>`Pandora’s Star`</cite>` by Peter F. Hamilton\n```\n\nExpecting:\n\n```\nExtract from _Pandora’s Star_ by Peter F. Hamilton\n```\n\nThis is only my second day using Jade, so please forgive any ignorance. I should note that I'm using Codekit to compile my Jade files and thought I would check Jade's filter behavior here prior to opening a bug with the Codekit developer if this is a non-issue for Node/other users or an unsupported feature.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pugjs/pug/issues/964/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pugjs/pug/issues/964/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pugjs/pug/issues/comments/16752007","html_url":"https://github.com/pugjs/pug/issues/936#issuecomment-16752007","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pugjs/pug/issues/936","id":16752007,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE2NzUyMDA3","user":{"login":"jpillora","id":633843,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzMzg0Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/633843?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpillora","html_url":"https://github.com/jpillora","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpillora/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpillora/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpillora/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpillora/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpillora/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpillora/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpillora/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpillora/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpillora/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2013-04-22T02:56:24Z","updated_at":"2013-04-22T02:58:30Z","body":":+1:  for `#[ jade ]` It'd be easier to confuse `#{ }` with `${ }` than `#[ ]`. I think it's better to be clear that you're inside a jade block as opposed to a js block. \n\nRe: Silly nesting: Maybe just disallow nested inline jade (not sure how hard that'd be to implement though)\n\n@ForbesLindesay  Looks like you've merged #962, that should make this feature relatively easy to implement right ?
