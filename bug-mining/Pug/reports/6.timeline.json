everyone, I'm having a strange issue when trying to define a template for full pages, and partial pages for AJAX requests.\n\nMy **layout.jade** looks like :\n\n``` javascript\nif(!locals.xhr)\n    doctype html\n    html(lang=\"fr\")\n        head\n            //....\n        body\n            div.main_content\n                block content\n\n            block JavaScript\n                script(src=\"/public/js/jquery.min.js\")\n                //.. other common JS files\n\nelse\n    block content\n    block JavaScript\n```\n\nAnd my **page.jade** looks like :\n\n``` javascript\nextends layout.jade\n\nblock content\n    h1 Hey ! This is weird !\n\nblock append JavaScript\n    script(src=\"/page_specific.js\")\n```\n\nWhen the page is not requested with AJAX, there are no problems, it looks like :\n\n``` javascript\ndoctype html\n    html(lang=\"fr\")\n        head\n            //....\n        body\n            div.main_content\n                block content\n                    h1 Hey ! This is weird\n\n            block JavaScript\n                script(src=\"/public/js/jquery.min.js\")\n                script(src\"page_specific.js\")\n```\n\nBut when it is requested with AJAX, all the common JS files that should only be included if `locals.xhr` is false are also included in the response (I don't want to re-load jQuery, since it's already there) :\n\n``` javascript\nh1 Hey ! This is weird\nscript(src=\"/public/js/jquery.min.js\")\nscript(src\"page_specific.js\")\n```\n\nAm I doing something wrong ? Is it because templates are not dynamic ?
