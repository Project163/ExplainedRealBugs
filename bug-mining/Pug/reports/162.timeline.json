surprised that exists, didn't know about it myself (which is part of the reason it's not documented). \n\nThere are a few issues I potentially have with it:\n1. It leads to extra white space if you aren't careful.  The example you gave actually puts 3 spaces between each value.\n2. It seems like it will be somewhat redundant once we have support for ES6 multi-line strings (admittedly a long way down the line) as you could just do:\n   \n   ``` jade\n   div(attr=`foo\n     bar\n     baz`)\n   ```\n   \n   which will work without any special jade syntax (in the future).\n3. It seems kind of odd that the result of a multi-line jade attribute is a single line html attribute.\n\nI'm fairly happy to go either way.  The options are:\n1. Document it and support it for the foreseeable future.\n2.

The argument for this feature is that it helps you keep your code looking tidy by keeping the line lengths shorter.\n\n@domenic that's a pretty good point, I guess knockout bindings could lead to some very long lines.  I'm leaning towards documenting it and supporting it.\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pugjs/pug/issues/comments/39339320/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"ForbesLindesay","id":1260646,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNjA2NDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1260646?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ForbesLindesay","html_url":"https://github.com/ForbesLindesay","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ForbesLindesay/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ForbesLindesay/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ForbesLindesay/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ForbesLindesay/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ForbesLindesay/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ForbesLindesay/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ForbesLindesay/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ForbesLindesay/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ForbesLindesay/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":107921843,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MTA3OTIxODQz","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pugjs/pug/issues/events/107921843","actor":{"login":"lydell","id":2142817,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxNDI4MTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2142817?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lydell","html_url":"https://github.com/lydell","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lydell/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lydell/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lydell/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lydell/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lydell/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lydell/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lydell/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lydell/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lydell/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2014-04-02T14:49:22Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":107921844,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDEwNzkyMTg0NA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pugjs/pug/issues/events/107921844","actor":{"login":"lydell","id":2142817,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxNDI4MTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2142817?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lydell","html_url":"https://github.com/lydell","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lydell/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lydell/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lydell/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lydell/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lydell/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lydell/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lydell/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lydell/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lydell/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2014-04-02T14:49:22Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":107921845,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MTA3OTIxODQ1","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pugjs/pug/issues/events/107921845","actor":{"login":"domenic","id":617481,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYxNzQ4MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/617481?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/domenic","html_url":"https://github.com/domenic","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/domenic/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/domenic/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/domenic/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/domenic/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/domenic/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/domenic/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/domenic/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/domenic/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/domenic/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2014-04-02T14:49:22Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":107921846,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDEwNzkyMTg0Ng==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pugjs/pug/issues/events/107921846","actor":{"login":"domenic

One very common JavaScript expression is a string. The source code of a JavaScript string cannot contain newline characters, unless you escape them with a backslash. However, escaped newlines are ignored; they do not alter the content of the string. It simply allows you to continue the source code of the string on a new line.\n\nKnowing that I'm simply writing a JavaScript expression and nothing Jade-specific, the feature is totally expected without being documented.
