I think however that it vastly complicates things for two reasons:\n1. People are constantly surprised when things like code inside script tags and textareas don't work (See #347 for example)\n2. It vastly delays people learning about `.` because it's not in nearly as many of the examples as it could be.\n\nI think on balance things would be a lot simpler if we didn't special case any of the tags as text-only.\n","closed_by":{"login":"ForbesLindesay","id":1260646,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNjA2NDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1260646?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ForbesLindesay","html_url":"https://github.com/ForbesLindesay","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ForbesLindesay/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ForbesLindesay/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ForbesLindesay/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ForbesLindesay/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ForbesLindesay/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ForbesLindesay/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ForbesLindesay/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ForbesLindesay/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ForbesLindesay/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pugjs/pug/issues/875/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pugjs/pug/issues/875/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
