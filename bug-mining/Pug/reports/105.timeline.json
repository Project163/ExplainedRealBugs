have been using client-side templates recently.  I realized I couldn't figure out how to do something easily in Jade which seems like a fairly natural thing to do.\n\nI wanted to precompile Jade templates on the server and ship them with the rendered file.  In effect, compile Jade from within Jade, capturing the compiled function as a string so it can ship.\n\nIn HTML you usually do \"microtemplates\" like this:\n\n``` html\n<script type=\"text/template\" id=\"cool-template\">\n    p Hello World!\n</script>\n```\n\nwith a corresponding script like this:\n\n``` javascript\nvar template = jade.compile(\n    document.getElementById('cool-template'),\n    {client: true, compileDebug: false}\n);\n\ndocument.getElementById('insert-here').innerHTML = template();\n```\n\nI don't like this because (a) you have to send the whole 40k jade source file to the client, and (b) you waste time on the client side compiling a template that could be compiled and cached on the server.\n\nI would expect a feature like this in Jade:\n\n``` jade\nh1 Some cool dynamic content\n p#insert-here\n\nscript\n  | var template =\n  compile coolTemplate\n  | document.getElementById('insert-here').innerHTML = template();\n\nblock coolTemplate\n  p Hello World!\n```\n\nwhere `compile` would automagically turn the `coolTemplate` block into a _compiled_ function, ready to run.  It would obviously need to return the function as a string so it could be shipped in the template.\n\nI'm not saying this is the exact syntax to use, but the nearest I can figure out otherwise is to try to pass the jade instance as a local from express, do `jade.compile`, and then use `toString` on the resulting function.  This is about as gross as it

My dev team uses jade as a template language for everything. We're not always using express/node as our server. Often times it's just static html served through nginx or even django. We use Jade, Less, and CoffeeScript to create the output we post to the server.\n\nJust trying to understand the why on this since it is not backwards compatible.\n","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pugjs/pug/issues/comments/20711763/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"oliverseal","id":545820,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0NTgyMA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/545820?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/oliverseal","html_url":"https://github.com/oliverseal","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oliverseal/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oliverseal/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oliverseal/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oliverseal/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oliverseal/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oliverseal/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oliverseal/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oliverseal/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oliverseal/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pugjs/pug/issues/comments/20711930","html_url":"https://github.com/pugjs/pug/issues/875#issuecomment-20711930","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pugjs/pug/issues/875","id":20711930,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIwNzExOTMw","user":{"login":"notslang","id":1049204,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNDkyMDQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1049204?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/notslang","html_url":"https://github.com/notslang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/notslang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/notslang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/notslang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/notslang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/notslang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/notslang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/notslang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/notslang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/notslang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2013-07-09T23:09:23Z","updated_at":"2013-07-09T23:09:23Z","body":"It's

thing is that jade doesn't **just** mirror the special cases of html, we have the option of improving the experience.  As @slang800 says, it's about two things.  The case of `import` and equally filters like `:coffee` are a really good use case.  It's slightly more verbose, but more explicit to have:\n\n``` jade\nscript\n  :coffee\n    # coffee script here\n```\n\nthan\n\n``` jade\n:coffee\n  # coffee script here\n```\n\nI'd like to move towards the more explicit option, partly because it would allow things like:\n\n``` jade\npre\n  code\n    :coffee\n      # coffee script here\n```\n\nwhich wouldn't work very well at the moment.\n\nThe other thing is that the most likely case for large ish text blocks in examples is code snippets, but in the real world they happen all the time.  Because we make the `.` implicit for script and style elements, we hide it's existence from the vast majority of new users.  Lots of people end up writing jade like:\n\n``` jade\np\n  | Imagine this\n  | was a much\n  | longer piece\n  | of text and not\n  | just one with\n  | lots of line breaks\n```\n\nWhich is fine to read, but way too slow to type, so people give up.\n\nI think it's better to think of `jade` as a language for writing XML templates that just happens to have some pretty cool stuff to support some of HTML's extensions.\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pugjs/pug/issues/comments/20715563/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"ForbesLindesay","id":1260646,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNjA2NDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1260646?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ForbesLindesay","html_url":"https://github.com/ForbesLindesay","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ForbesLindesay/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ForbesLindesay/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ForbesLindesay/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ForbesLindesay/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ForbesLindesay/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ForbesLindesay/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ForbesLindesay/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ForbesLindesay/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ForbesLindesay/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":55863539,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50NTU4NjM1Mzk=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pugjs/pug/issues/events/55863539","actor":{"login":"notslang","id":1049204,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNDkyMDQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1049204?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/notslang","html_url":"https://github.com/notslang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/notslang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/notslang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/notslang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/notslang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/notslang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/notslang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/notslang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/notslang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/notslang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2013-07-10T00:51:31Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":55863540,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDU1ODYzNTQw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pugjs/pug/issues/events/55863540","actor":{"login":"notslang","id":1049204,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNDkyMDQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1049204?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/notslang","html_url":"https://github.com/notslang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/notslang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/notslang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/notslang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/notslang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/notslang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/notslang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/notslang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/notslang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/notslang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2013-07-10T00:51:31Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pugjs/pug/issues/comments/20718555","html_url":"https://github.com/pugjs/pug/issues/875#issuecomment-20718555","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pugjs/pug/issues/875","id":20718555,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIwNzE4NTU1","user":{"login":"oliverseal","id":545820,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0NTgyMA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/545820?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/oliverseal","html_url":"https://github.com/oliverseal","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oliverseal/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oliverseal/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oliverseal/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oliverseal/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oliverseal/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oliverseal/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oliverseal/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oliverseal/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oliverseal/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2013-07-10T02:40:44Z","updated_at":"2013-07-10T02:40:44Z"
