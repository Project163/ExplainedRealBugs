Is there a way to do this with partials that isn't overly complicated?  I can see partials working in the opposite direction (pointing the view at shell.jade and using user.jade as a partial), but calling user.jade seems more logical/readable from the controller and simply extending/overriding a wrapper.\n\nAny concerns with this concept?  Would this be putting functionality in jade that should be elsewhere (as per jade's design)?\n","closed_by":{"login":"tj","id":25254,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1MjU0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25254?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tj","html_url":"https://github.com/tj","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tj/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tj/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tj/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tj/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tj/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tj/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tj/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tj/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tj/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pugjs/pug/issues/242/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pugjs/pug/issues/242/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
