There are already things missing from this list (e.g. `!`, `=`) so it's really hard to properly maintain.  How about we simplify the requirements in https://github.com/pugjs/pug/blob/926f7c720112cac76cfedb003e25e9f43d3a1767/packages/pug-lexer/index.js#L406 to something like:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nvar tok = this.scan(/^\\.([_a-z0-9\\-]*[_a-z][_a-z0-9\\-]*)/i, 'class'); \r\n```\r\n\r\ni.e. must have at least one letter or `_` but can have that anywhere in the name.  I think this is probably a lot broader than what's technically allowed in the spec, but browsers tend to be fairly permissive.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe'd then need to replace the two error conditions
