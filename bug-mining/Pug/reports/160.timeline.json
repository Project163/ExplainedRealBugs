patch adds a pre-parse phase, filtering out everything that is not to be used in code generation (namely unbuffered comments) from the token stream and pre-parsing comments as a side effect.\n\nThe changes are minimal and should be self-explanatory.\n\nIMO, this is the simplest way solve this issue as it reuses existing code with almost no modification and no special cases that would complicate the parsing logic.\n\nThe only thing I'm not too happy with is the set of tests, they seemed to be auto-generated, but the generator was not in this repo, and adding tests on this level by hand seemed a bit odd, so I simply fixed up anything that was touching the changed token stream / AST.\nIn almost all the test-cases the comments were unbuffered, and thus were not part of the parsed AST failing the test, so in part of the cases they needed to be removed them from the *.expected.json completely and in others the buffer token attr was set to true in both the *.tokens.json and the corresponding *.expected.json, this effectively covers testing of all the changes made by the patch, though not in one single place.\n\nAnd as a bonus, this pre-parse phase can be used in the future to implement Common-Lisp style macros :)\n\nFixes https://github.com/jadejs/jade/issues/1954,
