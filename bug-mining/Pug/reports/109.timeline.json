issue is that we can't make `compile` async (because it doesn't even have that signature).  We can't make the function returned by `compile` asynchronous (because again, it doesn't even have that signature).\n\nWe can't make `.render` asynchronous, because\n\na) there's never any asynchronous work to do (because `compile` must be synchronous)\nb) some people rely on it being synchronous, because it actually is, and synchronous templating engines can be a lot easier to use.  They write code like:\n\n``` js\nfunction render(src, opts) {\n  var err, res;\n  jade.render(src, opts, function (e, r) { err = e, res = r }\n  if (err) throw err;\n  return res;\n}\n```\n\nIn fact, jade does exactly this in order to handle things like `less` filters.\n\nWe can't make `renderFile` truly asynchronous because it would be a nightmare to make `import` and `extends` be handled asynchronously without also making `compile` asynchronous (which as I've already said, isn't an option).  This means that although the first read might be asynchronous, all subsequent reads would be synchronous.\n\nCaching means that there's almost never a need to asynchronous reads, because the templates are only read once per application reboot.  So this isn't problem.  If you truly needed asynchronous rendering, you could just disallow `import` and `extends` and then read the file yourself and pass it to `jade.render`\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pugjs/pug/issues/comments/20811836/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"ForbesLindesay","id":1260646,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNjA2NDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1260646?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ForbesLindesay","html_url":"https://github.com/ForbesLindesay","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ForbesLindesay/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ForbesLindesay/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ForbesLindesay/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ForbesLindesay/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ForbesLindesay/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ForbesLindesay/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ForbesLindesay/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ForbesLindesay/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ForbesLindesay/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pugjs/pug/issues/comments/20812923","html_url":"https://github.com/pugjs/pug/issues/1104#issuecomment-20812923","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pugjs/pug/issues/1104","id":20812923,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIwODEyOTIz","user":{"login":"davidcornu","id":325821,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyNTgyMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/325821?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidcornu","html_url":"https://github.com/davidcornu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidcornu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidcornu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidcornu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidcornu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidcornu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidcornu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidcornu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidcornu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidcornu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2013-07-11T13:57:47Z","updated_at":"2013-07-11T13:57:47Z","body":"Thanks for the detailed explanation.
