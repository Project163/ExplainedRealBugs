There are some simple use cases which would be a great start:\n\n```\nmixin dialog(action, header, body, buttons)\n  form.dialog(action=action)\n    .dialog-hd\n      #{header}\n      a.close X\n    .dialog-bd #{body}\n    if buttons\n      .dialog-buttons #{buttons}\n\n\nmixin dialog(action='/answer')\n  block header\n    h2 What is the answer?\n      span.sub To life, the universe and everything else\n  block body\n    label Your answer:\n    input(name='answer')\n  block buttons\n    input(type='submit')\n```\n\nIt would be even more powerful if blocks could also be passed context and used along with iteration. This could enable some powerful UI abstractions that hide repetitive detail:\n\n```\nmixin grocery(items, each)\n  ui.grocery\n    each item in items\n      li.grocery-item\n        #{each(item)}\n        a.remove X\n  a.add-grocery Add item\n\nitems = [{ name: 'tomato', id: 1 }, { name: 'milk', id: 2 }]\ngrocery(items)\n  block each(item)\n    a(href='/item/' + item.id)= item.name\n```\n","closed_by":{"login":"tj","id":25254,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1MjU0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25254?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tj","html_url":"https://github.com/tj","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tj/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tj/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tj/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tj/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tj/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tj/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tj/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tj/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tj/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pugjs/pug/issues/310/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pugjs/pug/issues/310/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
