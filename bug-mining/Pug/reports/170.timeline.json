It transforms it as output, and output is pushed onto the template without further processing.\r\n\r\nin this model, the template\r\n\r\n````\r\n  p\r\n    :verbatim\r\n      div #[b welcome] #{username} ! \r\n````\r\n\r\nwould always render to\r\n\r\n````\r\n<p>div #[b welcome] ${username} !</p>    \r\n````\r\n\r\nnow when I look at what pug is compiling for this example, I get\r\n\r\n````js\r\npug_html = pug_html + \"\\u003Cp\\u003E\";\r\npug_html = pug_html + \"\\ndiv  #{username} ! \\n\\u003C\\u002Fp\\u003E\";\r\n````\r\n\r\nwhere jade was giving\r\n\r\n````js\r\nbuf.push(\"<p>\\ndiv \\n\\n \" + (jade.escape((jade_interp = username) == null ? '' : jade_interp)) + \" ! \\n</p>\");\r\n````\r\n\r\nso basically, tag interpolation always disappears while string interpolation was modified between jade and pug (I could not find a reference to this on https://pugjs.org/api/migration-v2.html )\r\n\r\nI know that the dynamic aspect of filters is an often requested feature but I was convinced that filters were only compile-time beasts, and now I realize that jade had a compilation pass on the result of a filter.\r\n\r\nThe pugjs documentation states that\r\n\r\n> Warning\r\n> Filters are rendered at compile time, which makes them fast but also means that they cannot support dynamic content or options.\r\n> \r\n\r\n@ForbesLindesay do you consider (as i do) that the input of a filter should always simply be added to the output after transformation (without any interpretation of the content) ?\r\n\r\nWhat should be done about jade migration path ? simply state that this is a backward incompatible change and that variable interpolation of filtered output is no longer supported ? \r\n\r\n@jbsulli I saw that you removed your PR on https://github.com/pugjs/pug-lexer/pull/75. was it not working ?\r\n\r\ndo you know if both interpolations (variable & tag) are always allowed and disallowed simultaneously or are there cases when one is allowed and not the other
