I think this should be altered so that it simply doesn't loop through and ignore the each block.\n\nI think this implementation is more practical because wrapping every \"each\" clause in the template in if conditions makes the template a bit bloated and i don't think it will have any negative effects. Its just a better fallback.\n\nI have included an example of what i mean:\n\n``` jade\neach item, i in myItems\n  li #{item.name}\n```\n\nIf myItems is undefined Jade would throw, i am suggesting it carries on, without going through the iterations.\n","closed_by":{"login":"ForbesLindesay","id":1260646,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNjA2NDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1260646?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ForbesLindesay","html_url":"https://github.com/ForbesLindesay","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ForbesLindesay/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ForbesLindesay/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ForbesLindesay/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ForbesLindesay/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ForbesLindesay/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ForbesLindesay/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ForbesLindesay/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ForbesLindesay/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ForbesLindesay/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pugjs/pug/issues/1495/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pugjs/pug/issues/1495/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
