Your last statement makes a lot of sense regarding block usage for organizing larger chunks where I might what to swap out which partial I'm using for a nav, etc.\n\nI also wanted to (re)touch upon the \"extends\" too.  Having to change folder structure to adjust the \"layout\" used for a given page doesn't _always_ make sense.  In most cases, the paths don't really matter (since routing in the app will take care of url organization), but there are cases where it could be very beneficial.  As an example (off the top of my head): what if I want a mobile vs desktop layout; the app layer could determine (user agent, cookie, ...) and add a data flag to switch (\"extends\") layout but still route to the same content template.

see... instead of index `block` overwriting always, it can append/prepend to layout `block`.\n\nInteresting... that is an extremely common use case for me in templating systems.

More slots to fill == more namespace clutter; so I would definitely appreciate this addition.\n\nEither way, I appreciate the all the work you've done so far... one of these days I'll stop being such a lazy dev and dive into the jade src :)  It looks like prepend/append may be simple enough to implement: add terms to the lexer and funcs to the parser.  I guess my problem is mainly with github - there are just **too many** good projects out there to read them all :)\n\nAlso, I'm not sure about django either.
