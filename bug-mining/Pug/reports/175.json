I decide to utilize the include feature with my filters and noticed that within the context of include, I can no longer include multiple filters. I have tried this with several different filters and in each case, it works without include, but not with include. I don't know if this is a bug or a feature request because I am not sure of the intended response, but it made sense to me that these should be able to work together.\r\n\r\nThank you for your consideration.\r\n<!-- Please give us any additional details we'll need in order to understand the issue here -->\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"coachshea","id":4015966,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwMTU5NjY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4015966?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/coachshea","html_url":"https://github.com/coachshea","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coachshea/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coachshea/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coachshea/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coachshea/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coachshea/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coachshea/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coachshea/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coachshea/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coachshea/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pugjs/pug/issues/2929/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pugjs/pug/issues/2929/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
