Comment by @pavel\r\n\r\nAs a proposition, maybe it would be better to go with some module-based solution for filters anyway?\r\nSomething like this:\r\n\r\n``` javascript\r\n// conf/pug.filters.js\r\nvar fs = require(\"fs\");\r\nvar coffee = require(\"coffee\");\r\nvar stylus = require(\"stylus\");\r\n\r\nvar filters = {};\r\nfilters.coffee = (opts) => {\r\n  var content = \"\";\r\n  if (opts.file) content = fs.readFileSync(opts.file);\r\n  content = content || opts.content;\r\n  return Promise.resolve({\r\n    content: coffee.compile(content),\r\n    outputFormat: \"js\"\r\n  });\r\n};\r\n\r\nfilters.stylus = (opts) => {\r\n  var content = \"\";\r\n  if (opts.file) content = fs.readFileSync(opts.file);\r\n  content = content || opts.content;\r\n  return new Promise(function (resolve, reject) {\r\n    stylus.render(content, {}, function (err, css) {\r\n        if (err) return reject(err);\r\n        resolve({\r\n            content: css,\r\n            outputFormat: \"css\"\r\n        });\r\n    });\r\n  });\r\n};\r\n\r\n// alias\r\nfilters[\"coffee-script\"] = filters.coffee;\r\n\r\nexport default filters;\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd use something like: `pug --filters conf/pug.filters.js index.pug`.\r\n\r\nThis way one can have custom filters, filters aliases, and can use whatever version of tools one wants, without loosing \"watch\" feature.\r\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pugjs/pug/issues/comments/274476306/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"ForbesLindesay","id":1260646,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNjA2NDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1260646?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ForbesLindesay","html_url":"https://github.com/ForbesLindesay","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ForbesLindesay/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ForbesLindesay/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ForbesLindesay/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ForbesLindesay/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ForbesLindesay/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ForbesLindesay/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ForbesLindesay/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ForbesLindesay/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ForbesLindesay/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":932729338,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50OTMyNzI5MzM4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pugjs/pug/issues/events/932729338","actor":{"login":"pavel","id":5321105,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzMjExMDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5321105?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavel","html_url":"https://github.com/pavel","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavel/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavel/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavel/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavel/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavel/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavel/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavel/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavel/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavel/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2017-01-23T12:29:04Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":932729339,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDkzMjcyOTMzOQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pugjs/pug/issues/events/932729339","actor":{"login":"pavel","id":5321105,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzMjExMDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5321105?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavel","html_url":"https://github.com/pavel","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavel/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavel/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavel/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavel/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavel/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavel/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavel/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavel/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pavel/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2017-01-23T12:29:04Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":933815226,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDkzMzgxNTIyNg==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pugjs/pug/issues/events/933815226","actor":{"login":"ForbesLindesay","id":1260646,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNjA2NDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1260646?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ForbesLindesay","html_url":"https://github.com/ForbesLindesay","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ForbesLindesay/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ForbesLindesay/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ForbesLindesay/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ForbesLindesay/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ForbesLindesay/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ForbesLindesay/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ForbesLindesay/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ForbesLindesay/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ForbesLindesay/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"d4107d69bb571dcfc2278199c56caad911812319","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pugjs/pug/commits/d4107d69bb571dcfc2278199c56caad911812319","created_at":"2017-01-24T01:40:28Z",

It provides a cleaner upgrade path from old versions.  Instead of updating everywhere you reference `:markdown` in your source code, just add `filterAliases: {markdown: ‘markdown-it’}`.\n2. It makes it really easy to swap out different implementations of essentially the same filter (e.g. all the different markdown parsers).\n3. Because `filterOptions` are processed **before** aliases, it lets you use aliases to define presets.  e.g. you could make `minify` and `beautify` both aliases of `uglify-js` but then apply different `fitlerOptions` to each alias.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pugjs/pug/issues/2681/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pugjs/pug/issues/2681/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":935438685,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50OTM1NDM4Njg1","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pugjs/pug/issues/events/935438685","actor":{"login":"ForbesLindesay","id":1260646,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNjA2NDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1260646?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ForbesLindesay","html_url":"https://github.com/ForbesLindesay","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ForbesLindesay/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ForbesLindesay/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ForbesLindesay/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ForbesLindesay/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ForbesLindesay/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ForbesLindesay/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ForbesLindesay/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ForbesLindesay/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ForbesLindesay/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2017-01-25T00:32:35Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":935438705,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDkzNTQzODcwNQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pugjs/pug/issues/events/935438705","actor":{"login":"ForbesLindesay","id":1260646,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNjA2NDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1260646?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ForbesLindesay","html_url":"https://github.com/ForbesLindesay","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ForbesLindesay/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ForbesLindesay/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ForbesLindesay/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ForbesLindesay/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ForbesLindesay/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ForbesLindesay/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ForbesLindesay/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ForbesLindesay/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ForbesLindesay/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"703383122621828cff74950d2e6abbe8deb87cc5","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pugjs/pug/commits/703383122621828cff74950d2e6abbe8deb87cc5","created_at":"2017-01-25T00:32:36Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
