documentation doesn't cover this, but I've found that ending a line with a back slash allows a string to continue onto the next line, which is something you'd expect.\n\n```\ndiv(attr=\"foo \\\n  bar \\\n  baz\")\n```\n\ncompiles to\n\n```\n<div attr=\"foo   bar   baz\"></div>\n```\n\nIt would be nice if this was documented.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pugjs/pug/issues/1447/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pugjs/pug/issues/1447/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"actor":{"login":"ecbftw","id":4751963,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3NTE5NjM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4751963?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ecbftw","html_url":"https://github.com/ecbftw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ecbftw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ecbftw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ecbftw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ecbftw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ecbftw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ecbftw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ecbftw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ecbftw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ecbftw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-09-04T17:54:46Z","updated_at":"2016-09-04T17:54:46Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pugjs/pug/issues/2521","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pugjs/pug","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pugjs/pug/issues/2521/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pugjs/pug/issues/2521/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pugjs/pug/issues/2521/events","html_url":"https://github.com/pugjs/pug/issues/2521","id":174955877,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWUxNzQ5NTU4Nzc=","number":2521,"title":"\"Sandbox\"

Version:**  2.03\r\nI'm writing an open source project for S3. S3 is not a real file system, so I get strings from 'objects/files'), and give it to render(). I want to be able to compile pug on S3. So this fails of course:\r\n\r\n```\r\nlet p=`\r\np oh hi\r\ninclude d\r\n`\r\nlet html = pug.render(p)\r\nconsole.log(html)\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt fails because of the include. If I could use renderFile(...) on a file system I would.  So try number two:\r\n```\r\nconst link = require('pug-linker')\r\nconst lex = require('pug-lexer')\r\nconst walk = require('pug-walk')\r\nconst parse = require('pug-parser')\r\n\r\nlet ast = parse(lex(p))\r\nwalk(ast, function before(node, replace) {\r\n\t\tconsole.log(node)\r\n\t}, {includeDependencies: true}\r\n)\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nMy plan would be to feed it a string when it needs one, I would provide it instead of the file system. I assume on 'FileReference'. But it has to work anytime I need a file, including markdown, extends, etc. \r\nJust like renderFile(...) but on S3.\r\nSadly I need some help/hints.
