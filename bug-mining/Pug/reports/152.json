For example:\n\n``` js\nconsole.log(jade.render('', { filename: 'some_file_path' }));\n```\n\nThis will log out the contents of the file at the path, rather than an empty string. Any content at all in the string will negate this:\n\n``` js\nconsole.log(jade.render('p hello', { filename: 'some_file_path' }));\n```\n\nThis renders the correct string, regardless of whether that's actually the contents of the file, as you'd expect.\n","closed_by":{"login":"hemanth","id":18315,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MzE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18315?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hemanth","html_url":"https://github.com/hemanth","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hemanth/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hemanth/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hemanth/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hemanth/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hemanth/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hemanth/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hemanth/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hemanth/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hemanth/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pugjs/pug/issues/1826/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pugjs/pug/issues/1826/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
