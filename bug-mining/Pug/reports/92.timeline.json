Now we are planning to update Jade, but we are facing this same issue.\n\nFor example, I use an abstract template for an informational block (an entry) on my feed page (just like the block describing one single comment in this github discussion). According to the type of data represented by this block, the abstract template is extended by different widget implementations. Therefore, I have a strong need to be able to include an overriden template multiple times on a page.
