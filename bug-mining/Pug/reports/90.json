Here is a proposed layout:\n\n``` jade\n!!!\nhead\n  title The Title\nbody\n  #content\n    yield\n  #footer\n    p foot\n```\n\nAnd the index:\n\n``` jade\ninclude layout\n  p this is the content\n```\n\nBut here is the result:\n\n``` html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<head>\n  <title>The Title</title>\n</head>\n<body>\n  <div id=\"content\"></div>\n  <div id=\"footer\">\n    <p>foot\n      <p>this is the content</p>\n    </p>\n  </div>\n</body>\n```\n\nJade is embedding \"this is the content\" as though there were no yield statement in the layout. It should be in the div with the id of \"content\".\n\nAm I doing something wrong, or is this an issue?\n\nThanks!\n","closed_by":{"login":"tj","id":25254,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1MjU0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25254?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tj","html_url":"https://github.com/tj","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tj/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tj/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tj/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tj/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tj/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tj/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tj/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tj/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tj/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pugjs/pug/issues/770/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pugjs/pug/issues/770/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
