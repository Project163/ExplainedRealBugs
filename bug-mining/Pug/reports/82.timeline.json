for the ack. I've used template inheritance in [Jinja](http://jinja.pocoo.org/) a little, and while it's nice for the top level layouts, I think blocks in mixins will be more useful for \"widget\" type abstractions where composition works better. Jinja enables something like this with [call support in macros](http://jinja.pocoo.org/docs/templates/#call) but it's limited to one block (without doing some tricky/ugly things).

this markup comes from: http://vanyarose.com/works/at-the-bottom-of-the-hill)\n\n---\n\nI think Jade needs to approach a mashup of `mixin` + `extends`. I.e. `extends` allows for:\n\n(Note the following is markup for a \"panel\", one of many)\n\n```\n// soundtrack.jade\nextends index\n\nblock head\n  header\n    h1.title!= panel.label\n    span.audio-player-control.play\n    span.audio-player-control.pause\n  progress(max=100)\n\nblock content\n  ul.audio-player-tracks\n    each track in panel.medias\n      li.audio-player-track.audio-track(data-formats=JSON.stringify(track.file_type),\n      data-name  = track.file_name,\n      data-files = JSON.stringify(track.full_file_name),\n      data-src-root = \"#{content_url}/#{track.path}/\",\n      data-src   = \"#{track.full_path}\")= track.file_name\n```\n\nHere is another panel:\n\n```\n// video.jade\nextends index\n\nblock content\n    each video in panel.medias\n        video.sublime.movie-player(width=\"280\", height=panel.media_height, preload=\"none\")\n            each video_format in video\n                // There are multiple formats for each video\n                source(src=\"#{content_url}/#{video_format.full_path}\")\n```\n\n---\n\nSo I want to be able to invoke multiple `extends` in a single file, and with arguments.\n\nWithout the ability for a `mixins` to receive blocks or `extends` to occur multiple times in a file here is the result when I want/need to consolidate my panels into a single file:\n- no DSL\n- not DRY\n- harder to read\n\n```\ninclude ../mixins/lists\n\n.major-section: div.panels\n\n  .column.column-1\n    .panel.poster: img( src=\"#{work.urls.main}/poster_280.jpg\" )\n\n
