Here's a jade template that reproduces it.  There are 2 :coffeescript filtered sections with semantically identical coffeescript.  However, the first one gets mangled by jade screwing up the function callback body.  The `$(\"div.comments\")` line ends up in the global scope instead of inside the function body. The second one is compiled correctly.  The issue seems to be caused by  the presence of a multiline object literal.\n\n```\n:coffeescript\n  obj = {\n   a: 1\n  }\n  $(\"a.comments\").click ->\n    $(\"div.comments\").dialog(width: 500)\n\n:coffeescript\n  obj = {a: 1}\n  $(\"a.comments\").click ->\n    $(\"div.comments\").dialog(width: 500)\n```\n","closed_by":{"login":"tj","id":25254,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1MjU0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25254?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tj","html_url":"https://github.com/tj","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tj/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tj/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tj/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tj/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tj/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tj/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tj/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tj/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tj/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pugjs/pug/issues/243/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pugjs/pug/issues/243/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
