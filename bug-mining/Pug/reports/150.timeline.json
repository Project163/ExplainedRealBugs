have the same as well. I've tracked it down to the callback in the following code:\n\n```\n      fs.watchFile(filename, {persistent: true, interval: 200}, function (filename) {\n        try {\n          renderFile(filename);\n        } catch (ex) {\n          // keep watching when error occured.\n          console.error(ex.stack || ex.message || ex);\n        }\n      });\n```\n\n`renderFile(filename)` passes an lstat object full of stats information and not the filename that renderFile wants.\n\nAccording to [these docs](http://nodejs.org/docs/v0.4.3/api/fs.html#fs.watchFile) the callback gets passed two stat objects and not the filename as it is expecting. Unfortunately the filename itself is not included in the stats so somehow the filename will need to be backed into the callback as a closure or something. This is not a trivial fix that affects more than just the callback otherwise I'd throw out a patch. Thoughts?\n\nI'm more than a little curious how such core functionality as this passed even rudimentary unit testing without getting caught.\n\nI also have a theory that this is responsible for breaking Prepros.io as well since the behavior is identical, just masked behind the GUI.\n","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pugjs/pug/issues/comments/68453761/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"rwxrob","id":3749067,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3NDkwNjc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3749067?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rwxrob","html_url":"https://github.com/rwxrob","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rwxrob/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rwxrob/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rwxrob/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rwxrob/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rwxrob/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rwxrob/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rwxrob/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rwxrob/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rwxrob/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pugjs/pug/issues/comments/68458625","html_url":"https://github.com/pugjs/pug/issues/1795#issuecomment-68458625","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pugjs/pug/issues/1795","id":68458625,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY4NDU4NjI1","user":{"login":"flintinatux","id":888052,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4ODA1Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/888052?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/flintinatux","html_url":"https://github.com/flintinatux","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/flintinatux/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/flintinatux/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/flintinatux/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/flintinatux/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/flintinatux/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/flintinatux/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/flintinatux/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/flintinatux/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/flintinatux/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-12-31T18:05:04Z","updated_at":"2014-12-31T18:05:04Z","body":"Technically it's already in a closure that encapsulates that filename.
