In my example, base.pug's `content` block is totally wiped out but replaced by a new `content` block in layout.pug.  However, when page.pug tries to put markup in the `content` block, it is ignored.\r\n\r\n## base.pug\r\n```pug\r\nblock body\r\n    block content\r\n```\r\n\r\n## layout.pug\r\n```pug\r\nextends ./base.pug\r\nblock body\r\n  script(src=\"jquery.js\")\r\n  block content\r\n    // blank page\r\n```\r\n\r\n## page.pug\r\n```pug\r\nextends ./layout.pug\r\nblock content\r\n  h1 Main page content!\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Expected page.html\r\n```html\r\n<script src=\"jquery.js\"></script>\r\n<h1>Main page content!</h1>\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Actual page.html\r\n```html\r\n<script src=\"jquery.js\"></script>\r\n<!-- blank page-->\r\n```\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n# Dependencies:\r\n    \"pug\": \"^2.0.0-beta11\",\r\n    \"pug-cli\": \"^1.0.0-alpha6\"\r\n# Command:\r\nnode_modules/.bin/pug -P page.pug\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen layout.pug's `content` block is renamed to `content2`, and page.pug replaces `content2` instead of `content`, it works.  This suggests that the `content` block introduced by layout.pug is not properly shadowing the `content` block declared in base.pug.","closed_by":{"login":"ForbesLindesay","id":1260646,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNjA2NDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1260646?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ForbesLindesay","html_url":"https://github.com/ForbesLindesay","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ForbesLindesay/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ForbesLindesay/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ForbesLindesay/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ForbesLindesay/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ForbesLindesay/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ForbesLindesay/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ForbesLindesay/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ForbesLindesay/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ForbesLindesay/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pugjs/pug/issues/2774/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pugjs/pug/issues/2774/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
