I think this should be supported in Jade. Example follows:\n\ntemplate.jade:\n\n```\nhtml\n    head\n        title test\n        script(src='whatever')\n        block extra_scripts\n    body\n        include nav_bar\n        block content\n```\n\nmypage.jade:\n\n```\nextends template\nblock extra_scripts\n    script(src='my_awesome_script')\nblock content\n    p Hello world\n```\n\nnav_bar.jade:\n\n```\nblock extra_scripts\n    script(src='another_script')\nul\n    li Home\n    li About\n```\n\nThe problem is twofold; first blocks don't seem to behave properly across `include` boundaries, and second, in this example, `extra_scripts` block should contain both scripts, but doesn't. Am I just using it wrong or is this an actual problem?\n","closed_by":{"login":"tj","id":25254,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1MjU0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25254?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tj","html_url":"https://github.com/tj","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tj/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tj/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tj/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tj/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tj/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tj/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tj/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tj/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tj/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pugjs/pug/issues/355/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pugjs/pug/issues/355/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
