Now it will always be relative to the cwd.\n\nAlso the `--path` option will not work in this case because it falls back to filename that is later overwritten by the change pointed initially.\n\nThanks.\n","closed_by":{"login":"TimothyGu","id":1538624,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1Mzg2MjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1538624?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimothyGu","html_url":"https://github.com/TimothyGu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimothyGu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimothyGu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimothyGu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimothyGu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimothyGu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimothyGu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimothyGu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimothyGu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TimothyGu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pugjs/pug/issues/1788/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pugjs/pug/issues/1788/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
