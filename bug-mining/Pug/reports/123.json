Looking around a little more I saw that line 671 of [this file](https://github.com/visionmedia/jade/blob/2ab7df2fbbd71e599351bdd2f983476e1135a4cf/lib/compiler.js#L671) contains what appears to be an extraneous `\"` character.\n\nI really am not familiar enough with the jade internals to know if it is intentional enough or not, so I modified my local copy and the bug went away. I then ran the tests and they all passed.\n\nI'm 1) not sure if this is an intended character and 2) not sure enough of the jade internals to make a pull request, so I hope you'll be able to let me know if this is intended.\n","closed_by":{"login":"ForbesLindesay","id":1260646,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNjA2NDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1260646?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ForbesLindesay","html_url":"https://github.com/ForbesLindesay","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ForbesLindesay/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ForbesLindesay/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ForbesLindesay/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ForbesLindesay/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ForbesLindesay/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ForbesLindesay/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ForbesLindesay/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ForbesLindesay/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ForbesLindesay/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pugjs/pug/issues/1425/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pugjs/pug/issues/1425/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
