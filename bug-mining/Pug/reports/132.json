Every other watch apart from jade will keep running when there is a compile error. I have to stop the entire task and restart it when I forget to add text after an `#id_declaration` or some such issue.\n\nAm I missing something here, or is this a bug (or a feature)?\n","closed_by":{"login":"jbnicolai","id":3891755,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4OTE3NTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3891755?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbnicolai","html_url":"https://github.com/jbnicolai","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbnicolai/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbnicolai/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbnicolai/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbnicolai/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbnicolai/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbnicolai/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbnicolai/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbnicolai/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbnicolai/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pugjs/pug/issues/1482/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pugjs/pug/issues/1482/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
