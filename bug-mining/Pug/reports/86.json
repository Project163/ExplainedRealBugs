Like if you have\n\n``` Jade\nmixin item(icon)\n  li.list-item\n    if attributes.href\n      a(attributes)\n        img.icon(src = icon + \".png\")\n        span.inner\n          block\n    else\n      span(attributes)\n        img.icon(src = icon + \".png\")\n        span.inner\n          block\n\n+item(\"about\") About us\n+item(\"portfolio\")(href=\"/portfolio/\") Portfolio\n+item(\"contacts\")(href=\"/contacts/\") Contact us\n```\n\nRight now, as you see, you need to completely duplicate the code in the tags for different tags. Of course, you could do something like that:\n\n``` Jade\nmixin item(icon)\n  mixin item-contents\n    img.icon(src = icon + \".png\")\n    span.inner\n      block\n  li.list-item\n    if attributes.href\n      a(attributes)\n        +item-contents\n    else\n      span(attributes)\n        +item-contents\n```\n\nBut it's still ugly and if you'd have some extra different tags available (`strong` for current item, etc.), it would be ugly.\n\nSo, something like that would be much better:\n\n``` Jade\nmixin item(icon)\n  li.list-item\n    tag = 'span'\n    if attributes.href\n      tag = 'a'\n\n    #{tag}(attributes)\n      img.icon(src = icon + \".png\")\n      span.inner\n        block\n```\n\nAnother way, is to create pseudo-attribute like `tagName`, so if you'd set it, the tag's name would change. That would be even prettier:\n\n``` Jade\n\nmixin item(icon)\n  li.list-item\n    span(attributes, tagName = attributes.href ? 'a' : undefined)\n      img.icon(src = icon + \".png\")\n      span.inner\n        block\n```\n","closed_by":{"login":"tj","id":25254,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1MjU0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25254?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tj","html_url":"https://github.com/tj","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tj/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tj/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tj/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tj/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tj/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tj/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tj/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tj/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tj/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pugjs/pug/issues/657/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pugjs/pug/issues/657/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
