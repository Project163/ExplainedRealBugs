When stepping through layers of commands, sometimes the \"step\" button flips to the \"stop\" while a command is running/blocked. In cases like this, a careless developer can easily cancel their execution by mistake, and have to start debugging all over again. \n\nCan the placement of these buttons be changed to help prevent these issues?\n\n<img width=\"289\" height=\"118\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/df64d658-7b6a-4079-ad64-bd74e9bb3c32\" />\n\n<img width=\"289\" height=\"118\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ccf4add6-6065-45b2-9b1b-9076f1529446\" />\n\n### Why is this needed?\n\nI would like this because often I find myself stepping through a test to debug issues, but accidentally click the \"stop running\" button, and then I need to start my hunt all over again. This feels like a relatively small change for a fairly decent UX improvement\n\n### Other\n\n_No response_","closed_by":{"login":"jennifer-shehane","id":1271364,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNzEzNjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1271364?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jennifer-shehane","html_url":"https://github.com/jennifer-shehane","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jennifer-shehane/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jennifer-shehane/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jennifer-shehane/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jennifer-shehane/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jennifer-shehane/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jennifer-shehane/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jennifer-shehane/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jennifer-shehane/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jennifer-shehane/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cypress-io/cypress/issues/32476/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cypress-io/cypress/issues/32476/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
