Current behavior\r\n\r\nMy typescript project (`\"type\":\"module\"`) is organised as follows:\r\n\r\n```\r\napp\r\n  - src\r\n    - utils\r\n      - util.ts\r\n    - other-code\r\n  - cypress\r\n    - e2e\r\n      - spec.cy.ts\r\n  package.json\r\n```\r\nI'm trying to import `util.ts` from `spec.cy.ts` using\r\n\r\n`import { utilA } from \"../../src/utils/util.js\";`\r\n\r\nwhich is the correct typescript compliant syntax for importing ESM modules.\r\n\r\nOn running `spec.cy.ts`, I encounter\r\n\r\n```\r\nError: Webpack Compilation Error\r\nModule not found: Error: Can't resolve '../../src/utils/util.js'\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis issue is very similar to https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/26827 which should supposedly have been fixed after cypress upgraded to webpack v5. However, I'm using the cypress `13.6.3` and still facing the issue.\r\n\r\n### Desired behavior\r\n\r\nCypress should support TypeScript-style fully-qualified ESM imports where one can import a .ts file by using a .js extension. In the context of this particular example, `import { utilA } from \"../../src/utils/util.js\";` should automatically import from \"../../src/utils/util.ts\"`. Note that it is not about changing the extension of the imported file but recursively importing across the dependency chain.\r\n\r\n### Test code to reproduce\r\n\r\nHere is a repo which reproduces the issue: https://github.com/mukulgupta21/cypress-ts-issue\r\n\r\n### Cypress Version\r\n\r\n13.6.3\r\n\r\n### Node version\r\n\r\n18.15.0\r\n\r\n### Operating System\r\n\r\nmacOS Venture, 13.3.1\r\n\r\n### Debug Logs\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Other\r\n\r\nIn the [linked issue](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/26827#issuecomment-1612039542), it was advised to use `@cypress/webpack-preprocessor` and `extensionAlias`.\r\n\r\nI tried using that (as below) and was able to get it to work but it required installing `webpack`, `ts-loader`, `@babel/core`, `@babel/preset-env` as devDependencies to my original package which shouldn't have been required had cypress provide built-in support.\r\n\r\n```\r\n    setupNodeEvents(on, config) {\r\n      let options = webpackPreprocessor.defaultOptions;\r\n      const customOptions = {\r\n        webpackOptions: {\r\n          resolve: {\r\n            extensionAlias: {\r\n              '.js': ['.ts', '.js'],\r\n            }\r\n          }\r\n        }\r\n      };\r\n      options.webpackOptions = {\r\n        ...options.webpackOptions,\r\n        ...customOptions.webpackOptions,\r\n      }\r\n      options.webpackOptions.module?.rules?.push({\r\n          // every time webpack sees a TS file (except for node_modules)\r\n          // webpack will use \"ts-loader\" to transpile it to JavaScript\r\n          test: /\\.ts$/,\r\n          exclude: [/node_modules/],\r\n          use: [\r\n            {\r\n              loader: 'ts-loader',\r\n              options: {\r\n                // skip typechecking for speed\r\n                transpileOnly: true,\r\n              },\r\n            },\r\n          ],\r\n        });\r\n      on('file:preprocessor', webpackPreprocessor(options));\r\n    }\r\n```","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cypress-io/cypress/issues/28805/reactions","total_count":4,"+1":3,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":1},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cypress-io/cypress/issues/28805/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":18486100367,"node_id":"REFE_lADOAeKht85miYirzwAAAARN24GP","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cypress-io/cypress/issues/events/18486100367","actor":{"login":"mdmower-csnw","id":135273348,"node_id":"U_kgDOCBAbhA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/135273348?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdmower-csnw","html_url":"https://github.com/mdmower-csnw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdmower-csnw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdmower-csnw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdmower-csnw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdmower-csnw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdmower-csnw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdmower-csnw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdmower-csnw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdmower-csnw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdmower-csnw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"6cfaa7f0c5e5729e2f36c451c74c0480bfd7e3d0","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mdmower-csnw/cypress/commits/6cfaa7f0c5e5729e2f36c451c74c0480bfd7e3d0","created_at":"2025-07-05T17:56:03Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"actor":{"login":"mdmower-csnw","id":135273348,"node_id":"U_kgDOCBAbhA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/135273348?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdmower-csnw","html_url":"https://github.com/mdmower-csnw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdmower-csnw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdmower-csnw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdmower-csnw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdmower-csnw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdmower-csnw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdmower-csnw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdmower-csnw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdmower-csnw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mdmower-csnw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-07-05T17:58:47Z","updated_at":"2025-07-05T17:58:47Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cypress-io/cypress/issues/31994","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cypress-io/cypress","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cypress-io/cypress/issues/31994/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cypress-io/cypress/issues/31994/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cypress-io/cypress/issues/31994/events","html_url":"https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/pull/31994","id":3205342336,"node_id":"PR_kwDOAeKht86dkqD1","number":31994,"title":"fix:
