Closes #32476\r\n\r\n## Additional details\r\n\r\nThis change fixes the Next button placement and behavior during test stepping workflow. The issue was that the Next button would appear and disappear inconsistently during stepping, causing poor UX when debugging tests with `cy.pause()` and `cy.debug()` commands.\r\n\r\n## Why was this change necessary?\r\n\r\n- Users experienced inconsistent button placement during test stepping\r\n- The Next button would disappear when resuming from pause, causing inconsistent positioning\r\n\r\n## What is affected by this change?\r\n- **AppState**: Added `isResumed` property to track resume status\r\n- **Controls component**: Updated Next button visibility logic\r\n- **Test coverage**: Added tests for next button states\r\n- **Button styling**: Fixed disabled hover effects to prevent highlights\r\n\r\n**Implementation details:**\r\n- **New visibility condition**: Shows button when `isPaused` OR `(isRunning && isResumed)`\r\n- **Added `isResumed` state**: Tracks when tests have been resumed from pause\r\n- **Test coverage**: Tests scenarios including \"running after resume\"\r\n- **Disabled styling**: Prevents border highlights on disabled button hover\r\n\r\n**Button Behavior:** \r\n- **When paused with next command**: Visible and enabled ✅\r\n- **When paused without next command**: Visible but disabled ✅  \r\n- **When running after resume**: Visible but disabled ✅ \r\n- **When running (never paused)**: Hidden ✅\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n**Added two new test scenarios**:\r\n- **\"when running after resume\"** - validates the button stays visible but disabled after resuming from pause\r\n- **\"when paused without next command\"** - ensures proper disabled state when no next step is available\r\n\r\n## How has the user experience changed?\r\n\r\n**Before:** Next button would appear and disappear unpredictably during stepping making it difficult to maintain debugging flow.\r\n\r\n**After:** Next button maintains consistent visibility during stepping sessions, staying visible but appropriately disabled when no immediate next command is available, providing clear visual feedback to users about stepping state.\r\n\r\n**1. Before tests start:**\r\n![Before tests start - No Next button](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8404fe39-2b9c-4354-b655-e741d3768084)\r\n*No Next button visible, clean interface*\r\n\r\n**2.
