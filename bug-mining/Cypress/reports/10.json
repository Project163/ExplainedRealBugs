I have a file `boolean.ts` like the following:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nexport const TRUE = true;\r\n```\r\n\r\nI try to import a value into one of my Cypress test files with an import like the following:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nimport { TRUE } from '../lib/boolean.js';\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis fails with the following error:\r\n\r\n```\r\nModule not found: Error: Can't resolve '../lib/boolean.js' in '/Users/nathan/git/cypress-esm-fully-qualified-import-repro/cypress/e2e'\r\nLooked for and couldn't find the file at the following paths:\r\n[/Users/nathan/git/cypress-esm-fully-qualified-import-repro/cypress/lib/boolean.js]\r\n[/Users/nathan/git/cypress-esm-fully-qualified-import-repro/cypress/lib/boolean.js.js]\r\n[/Users/nathan/git/cypress-esm-fully-qualified-import-repro/cypress/lib/boolean.js.json]\r\n[/Users/nathan/git/cypress-esm-fully-qualified-import-repro/cypress/lib/boolean.js.jsx]\r\n[/Users/nathan/git/cypress-esm-fully-qualified-import-repro/cypress/lib/boolean.js.mjs]\r\n[/Users/nathan/git/cypress-esm-fully-qualified-import-repro/cypress/lib/boolean.js.coffee]\r\n[/Users/nathan/git/cypress-esm-fully-qualified-import-repro/cypress/lib/boolean.js.ts]\r\n[/Users/nathan/git/cypress-esm-fully-qualified-import-repro/cypress/lib/boolean.js.tsx]\r\n```\n\n### Desired behavior\n\nCypress should support TypeScript-style fully-qualified ESM imports where one can import a `.ts` file by using a `.js` extension. In the context of this particular example, `import ... from './modules.js` should import `module.ts`.\n\n### Test code to reproduce\n\nhttps://github.com/nwalters512/cypress-esm-fully-qualified-import-repro. Ignore the fact that defining and importing a `TRUE` constant isn't a real-world scenario 😉 \n\n### Cypress Version\n\n12.12.0\n\n### Node version\n\n18.12.0\n\n### Operating System\n\nmacOS 13.3.1\n\n### Debug Logs\n\n```shell\nN/A\n```\n\n\n### Other\n\nI believe webpack's [`resolve.extensionAlias`](https://webpack.js.org/configuration/resolve/#resolveextensionalias) will be useful here. The example from their docs is probably pretty close to what you want:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nmodule.exports = {\r\n  //...\r\n  resolve: {\r\n    extensionAlias: {\r\n      '.js': ['.ts', '.js'],\r\n      '.mjs': ['.mts', '.mjs'],\r\n    },\r\n  },\r\n};\r\n```","closed_by":{"login":"jennifer-shehane","id":1271364,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNzEzNjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1271364?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jennifer-shehane","html_url":"https://github.com/jennifer-shehane","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jennifer-shehane/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jennifer-shehane/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jennifer-shehane/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jennifer-shehane/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jennifer-shehane/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jennifer-shehane/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jennifer-shehane/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jennifer-shehane/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jennifer-shehane/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cypress-io/cypress/issues/26827/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cypress-io/cypress/issues/26827/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
