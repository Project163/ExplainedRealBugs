However, that tsconfig path seems to be fully ignored; if I pass in a random string, everything builds/tests as it should. I dug a bit through the code and looking at e.g https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/blob/a9d97114073f0ddc2983d775bfef60145df99902/npm/webpack-dev-server/src/helpers/angularHandler.ts#L135, it always uses <projectroot>/tsconfig.json. \r\n\r\n\r\n### Desired behavior\r\n\r\nIn my Angular / NX apps I have:\r\n- tsconfig.json (baseline)\r\n- tsconfig.app.json\r\n- tsconfig.jest.json\r\n- tsconfig.editor.json\r\n\r\nI would also like to have a tsconfig.cypress.json to ensure the correct paths etc are used without having to interfere with the rest of my tsconfig-setup.\r\n\r\n### Test code to reproduce\r\n\r\n```typescript\r\n// cypress.config.ts\r\nexport default defineConfig({\r\n  component: {\r\n    video: true,\r\n    videosFolder: root + 'dist/cypress/components/videos',\r\n    screenshotsFolder: root + 'dist/cypress/components/screenshots',\r\n    devServer: {\r\n      framework: 'angular',\r\n      bundler: 'webpack',\r\n      options: { // temporary, this will be done automatically when we get it directly from nx\r\n        projectConfig: {\r\n          root: projectRoot,\r\n          sourceRoot: projectRoot + 'src',\r\n          buildOptions: {\r\n            tsConfig: _projectRoot + 'tsconfig.app.json',\r\n            ... more config (that works yay)\r\n          },\r\n        }\r\n      }\r\n    },\r\n    specPattern: 'cypress/specs/**/*.cy.ts',\r\n  },\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Cypress Version\r\n\r\n10.7.0\r\n\r\n### Node version\r\n\r\nv18.4.0 (also tried with 16.2.0)\r\n\r\n### Operating System\r\n\r\nmacOS 12.5\r\n\r\n### Debug Logs\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Other\r\n\r\n_No response_","closed_by":{"login":"lmiller1990","id":19196536,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5MTk2NTM2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19196536?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lmiller1990","html_url":"https://github.com/lmiller1990","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lmiller1990/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lmiller1990/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lmiller1990/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lmiller1990/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lmiller1990/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lmiller1990/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lmiller1990/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lmiller1990/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lmiller1990/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cypress-io/cypress/issues/23673/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cypress-io/cypress/issues/23673/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
