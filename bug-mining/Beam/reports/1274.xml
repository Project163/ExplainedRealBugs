&lt;div class=&quot;code panel&quot; style=&quot;border-width: 1px;&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;codeContent panelContent&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;code-java&quot;&gt;
docker system prune --all --filter until=24h --force
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now where should we put it? Is there a periodic maintenance Jenkins job?&lt;/p&gt;</comment>

The filter is by creation date, so any older stable images will get removed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A concurrent job might see an image and between that and creating a container the image could get get pruned.&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, even with&#160;periodic execution, we can have other jobs which might be interacting with docker repository.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="16891442" author="angoenka" created="Tue, 23 Jul 2019 22:53:04 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;&quot;I&apos;m thinking of piggy-backing on the inventory job. WDYT?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SGTM. We can expand the scope of inventory job to do the machine house keeping.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="16892156" author="udim" created="Wed, 24 Jul 2019 20:23:56 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;This is done in #9138. One possible side-effect is that `docker system prune` races with docker-based builds: an unused image being removed while a build checks that it is there and tries to use it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another is increased downloads of images (since pruning is according to &quot;created&quot; not &quot;last used&quot; date): longer builds (should be negligible), flakes due to failed downloads (unaware of such issues).&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
