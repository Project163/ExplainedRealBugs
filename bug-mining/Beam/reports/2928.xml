            <title>[BEAM-14064] ElasticSearchIO#Write buffering and outputting across windows</title>
                <link>https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/BEAM-14064</link>
                <project id="12319527" key="BEAM">Beam</project>
                    <description>&lt;p&gt;Source: &lt;a href=&quot;https://lists.apache.org/thread/mtwtno2o88lx3zl12jlz7o5w1lcgm2db&quot; class=&quot;external-link&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;https://lists.apache.org/thread/mtwtno2o88lx3zl12jlz7o5w1lcgm2db&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Bug PR: &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/15381&quot; class=&quot;external-link&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/15381&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ElasticsearchIO is collecting results from elements in window X and then trying to output them in window Y when flushing the batch. This exposed a bug where elements that were being buffered were being output as part of a different window than what the window that produced them was.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This became visible because validation&#160;was added recently to ensure that when the pipeline is processing elements in window X that output with a timestamp is valid for window X. Note that this validation only occurs in &lt;b&gt;@ProcessElement&lt;/b&gt; since output is associated with the current window with the input element that is being processed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is ok to do this in &lt;b&gt;@FinishBundle&lt;/b&gt; since there is no existing windowing context and when you output that element is assigned to an appropriate window.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Further Context&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We&#8217;ve bisected it to being introduced in 2.35.0, and I&#8217;m reasonably certain it&#8217;s this PR &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/15381&quot; class=&quot;external-link&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/15381&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our scenario is pretty trivial, we read off Pubsub and write to Elastic in a streaming job, the config for the source and sink is respectively&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class=&quot;preformatted panel&quot; style=&quot;border-width: 1px;&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;preformattedContent panelContent&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;pipeline.apply(
            PubsubIO.readStrings().fromSubscription(subscription)
        ).apply(ParseJsons.of(OurObject::class.java))
            .setCoder(KryoCoder.of())
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class=&quot;preformatted panel&quot; style=&quot;border-width: 1px;&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;preformattedContent panelContent&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;ElasticsearchIO.write()
            .withUseStatefulBatches(true)
            .withMaxParallelRequestsPerWindow(1)
            .withMaxBufferingDuration(Duration.standardSeconds(30))
            // 5 bytes **&amp;gt; KiB **&amp;gt; MiB, so 5 MiB
            .withMaxBatchSizeBytes(5L * 1024 * 1024)
            // # of docs
            .withMaxBatchSize(1000)
            .withConnectionConfiguration(
                ElasticsearchIO.ConnectionConfiguration.create(
                    arrayOf(host),
                    &quot;fubar&quot;,
                    &quot;_doc&quot;
                ).withConnectTimeout(5000)
                    .withSocketTimeout(30000)
            )
            .withRetryConfiguration(
                ElasticsearchIO.RetryConfiguration.create(
                    10,
                    // the duration is wall clock, against the connection and socket timeouts specified
                    // above. I.e., 10 x 30s is gonna be more than 3 minutes, so if we&apos;re getting
                    // 10 socket timeouts in a row, this would ignore the &quot;10&quot; part and terminate
                    // after 6. The idea is that in a mixed failure mode, you&apos;d get different timeouts
                    // of different durations, and on average 10 x fails &amp;lt; 4m.
                    // That said, 4m is arbitrary, so adjust as and when needed.
                    Duration.standardMinutes(4)
                )
            )
            .withIdFn { f: JsonNode -&amp;gt; f[&quot;id&quot;].asText() }
            .withIndexFn { f: JsonNode -&amp;gt; f[&quot;schema_name&quot;].asText() }
            .withIsDeleteFn { f: JsonNode -&amp;gt; f[&quot;_action&quot;].asText(&quot;noop&quot;) == &quot;delete&quot; }
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We recently tried upgrading 2.33 to 2.36 and immediately hit a bug in the consumer, due to alleged time skew, specifically&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;preformatted panel&quot; style=&quot;border-width: 1px;&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;preformattedContent panelContent&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;2022-03-07 10:48:37.886 GMTError message from worker: java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: Cannot output with timestamp 2022-03-07T10:43:38.640Z. Output timestamps must be no earlier than the timestamp of the 
current input (2022-03-07T10:43:43.562Z) minus the allowed skew (0 milliseconds) and no later than 294247-01-10T04:00:54.775Z. See the DoFn#getAllowedTimestampSkew() Javadoc 
for details on changing the allowed skew.

&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&#8217;ve bisected it and 2.34 works fine, 2.35 is the first version this breaks, and it seems like the code in the trace is largely added by the PR linked above. The error usually claims a skew of a few seconds, but obviously I can&#8217;t override getAllowedTimestampSkew() on the internal Elastic DoFn, and it&#8217;s marked deprecated anyway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&#8217;m happy to raise a JIRA but I&#8217;m not 100% sure what the code was intending to fix, and additionally, I&#8217;d also be happy if someone else can reproduce this or knows of similar reports. I feel like what we&#8217;re doing is not that uncommon a scenario, so I would have thought someone else would have hit this by now.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;The change also prompted a question to the mailing list&lt;span class=&quot;error&quot;&gt;&amp;#91;2&amp;#93;&lt;/span&gt; about skew validation difference between ProcessContext vs FinishBundleContext (where there is no ability to compute skew as I understand it).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&apos;ll echo this response to the mailing list.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;error&quot;&gt;&amp;#91;1&amp;#93;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/16744&quot; class=&quot;external-link&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/16744&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

That being said, 2.37.0 is being deployed so I guess it is too late, this change will be put to 2.38 as 2.37 was cut before the change was merged. Adding the current ticket to the name of the PR/commits would have helped in merging it quicker (as the PR was sumitted before 2.37.0 cut) by making it obvious that it was linked to a (blocker) bug.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="17503634" author="egalpin" created="Wed, 9 Mar 2022 14:58:22 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;Definitely a good point, I&apos;ll keep that in mind for next time. I wasn&apos;t sure of severity of the bug at the time I opened the fix PR as the issue arose for me after redeploying a pipeline from a Snapshot/checkpoint, and I had falsely misinterpreted the issue to be associated with a corrupt snapshot/checkpoint.&#160;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&apos;s definitely good for me to keep in mind for the future that linking PRs with Jira can help with expediency and noting which bugs are blockers.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>

Only it is a pitty that I did not know it was linked to a bug otherwise I would have reviewed quicker and I would have included it in 2.37.0 &lt;img class=&quot;emoticon&quot; src=&quot;https://issues.apache.org/jira/images/icons/emoticons/smile.png&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; width=&quot;16&quot; align=&quot;absmiddle&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot;/&gt; &#160;&lt;/p&gt;</comment>

                            <comment id="17512106" author="danoliveira" created="Thu, 24 Mar 2022 22:36:19 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;Hi, I&apos;m managing the 2.38.0 release. I see this is set to release-blocking, but I&apos;m not sure if it&apos;s actually worth blocking the release.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While it does fit our &quot;significant regression or loss of functionality&quot; requirement &lt;a href=&quot;https://beam.apache.org/contribute/release-blocking/&quot; class=&quot;external-link&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;from the website&lt;/a&gt;, we&apos;ve set a precedent of blocking for new regressions and not blocking for known existing issues. Basically, since this issue has been present for the past 3 releases, it&apos;s not a new regression and not something we want to block a release on. The cat&apos;s already out of the bag, so to speak. In addition to all that, the scope of this seems limited to ElasticsearchIO. If it had broad impact it might be worth making an exception, but not as it stands.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Evan, can we take this off the release blocker list and just get it in for 2.39.0 instead? Do you have an argument for keeping it as a release blocker?&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="17512133" author="egalpin" created="Thu, 24 Mar 2022 23:56:34 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;Hi Daniel!&#160; Thank you for managing the release and for all of the effort that goes along with that. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&#160;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One argument for keeping this as a release blocker is that another PR&lt;span class=&quot;error&quot;&gt;&amp;#91;1&amp;#93;&lt;/span&gt; was merged which would alter the nature of the regression or I suppose is a new regression. Previously, this error would result in a pipeline getting completely stuck under common use cases. Now with &lt;span class=&quot;error&quot;&gt;&amp;#91;1&amp;#93;&lt;/span&gt; having been merged, the error will be silent in nature and could result in lost data. &lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The work to fix the issue properly is complete and small to review&lt;span class=&quot;error&quot;&gt;&amp;#91;2&amp;#93;&lt;/span&gt;, but I&#8217;m awaiting a definitive answer about watermark behaviour before being able to merge. Thoughts?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&#160;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;error&quot;&gt;&amp;#91;1&amp;#93;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/16744&quot; class=&quot;external-link&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/16744&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;error&quot;&gt;&amp;#91;2&amp;#93;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/17112&quot; class=&quot;external-link&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/17112&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</comment>

I&apos;d agree that if this is now silently dropping elements, that&apos;s what I would call a new regression. If that&apos;s all that remains to get in a PR and cherry-pick it into the release branch, then it sounds reasonable, we can just focus on getting an answer to your question on watermark behavior ASAP.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="17512484" author="egalpin" created="Fri, 25 Mar 2022 17:08:49 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;Thanks Daniel, that sounds great.&#160; I&apos;d be happy meet/chat/coordinate however I can in order to quickly resolve.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&#160;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to merge the fix, I require confirmation that all runners are expected to only update watermark at bundle boundaries&lt;span class=&quot;error&quot;&gt;&amp;#91;1&amp;#93;&lt;/span&gt; (which sounds like it may be the case, but there appear to be counter examples&lt;span class=&quot;error&quot;&gt;&amp;#91;2&amp;#93;&lt;/span&gt;) + PR approval of &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/17112&quot; class=&quot;external-link&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/17112&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;error&quot;&gt;&amp;#91;1&amp;#93;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://lists.apache.org/thread/7foy455spg43xo77zhrs62gc1m383t50&quot; class=&quot;external-link&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;https://lists.apache.org/thread/7foy455spg43xo77zhrs62gc1m383t50&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;error&quot;&gt;&amp;#91;2&amp;#93;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://lists.apache.org/thread/10db7l9bhnhmo484myps723sfxtjwwmv&quot; class=&quot;external-link&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;https://lists.apache.org/thread/10db7l9bhnhmo484myps723sfxtjwwmv&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</comment>

&lt;p&gt;1. I believe you were correct in your initial assessment that the issue does not meet the blocker criteria and;&lt;br/&gt;
2. The discussion around proper resolution is still very much unsettled&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
