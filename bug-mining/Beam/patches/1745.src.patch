 The Apache Beam SDK for Python uses **type hints** during pipeline construction and runtime to try to emulate the correctness guarantees achieved by true static typing. Additionally, using type hints lays some groundwork that allows the backend service to perform efficient type deduction and registration of `Coder` objects.
 
-Python version 3.5 introduces a module called **typing** to provide hints for type validators in the language. The Beam SDK for Python, based on Python version 2.7, implements a subset of [PEP 484](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0484/) and aims to follow it as closely as possible in its own typehints module.

+## Benefits of Type Hints
 
-When you use type hints, the runner raises exceptions during pipeline construction time, rather than runtime. For example, the runner generates an exception if it detects that your pipeline applies mismatched `PTransforms` (where the expected outputs of one transform do not match the expected inputs of the following transform). These exceptions are raised at pipeline construction time, regardless of where your pipeline will execute. Introducing type hints for the `PTransform`s you define allows you to catch potential bugs up front in the local runner, rather than after minutes of execution into a deep, complex pipeline.

+
+You can always declare type hints inline, but if you need them for code that is going to be reused, declare them as annotations or decorators.
+For example, if your `DoFn` requires an `int` input, it makes more sense to declare the type hint for the input as an annotation of the arguments to `process` (or a property of the `DoFn`) rather than inline.
+
+Using Annotations has the added benefit of allowing use of a static type checker (such as mypy) to additionally type check your code.
+If you already use a type checker, using annotations instead of decorators reduces code duplication.
+However, annotations do not cover all the use cases that decorators and inline declarations do.
+Two such are the `expand` of a composite transform and lambda functions.

+### Declaring Type Hints Using Type Annotations
+
+_New in version 2.21.0._
+
+To specify type hints as annotations on certain functions, use them as usual and omit any decorator hints or inline hints.
+
+Annotations are currently supported on:
+
+ - `process()` methods on `DoFn` subclasses.
+ - Functions passed to: `ParDo`, `Map`, `FlatMap`, `Filter`.
+
+The following code declares an `int` input and a `str` output type hint on the `to_id` transform, using annotations on `my_fn`.
+
+```py
+{% github_sample /apache/beam/blob/master/sdks/python/apache_beam/examples/snippets/snippets_test_py3.py tag:type_hints_map_annotations %}
+```
+
+The following code declares `int` input and output type hints on `filter_evens`, using annotations on `FilterEvensDoFn.process`.
+Since `process` returns a generator, the output type is annotated as `Iterable[int]` (`Generator[int, None, None]` would also work here).
+Beam will remove the outer iterable of the return type on the `DoFn.process` method and functions passed to `ParDo` and `FlatMap`.
+It is an error to have a non-iterable return type annotation for these functions.
+Other supported iterable types include: `Iterator`, `Generator`, `Tuple`, `List`.
+
+```py
+{% github_sample /apache/beam/blob/master/sdks/python/apache_beam/examples/snippets/snippets_test_py3.py tag:type_hints_do_fn_annotations %}
+```
+
+The following code declares `int` input and output type hints on `double_evens`, using annotations on `FilterEvensDoubleDoFn.process`.
+Since `process` returns a `list` or `None`, the output type is annotated as `Optional[List[int]]`.
+Beam will remove the outer `Optional` and (as above) the outer iterable of the return type, only on the `DoFn.process` method and functions passed to `ParDo` and `FlatMap`.
+
+```py
+{% github_sample /apache/beam/blob/master/sdks/python/apache_beam/examples/snippets/snippets_test_py3.py tag:type_hints_do_fn_annotations_optional %}
+```
 
 ### Declaring Type Hints Inline
 
 To specify type hints inline, use the methods `with_input_types` and `with_output_types`. The following example code declares an input type hint inline:
 
+```py
+{% github_sample /apache/beam/blob/master/sdks/python/apache_beam/examples/snippets/snippets_test.py tag:type_hints_takes %}
 ```
-{% github_sample /apache/beam/blob/master/sdks/python/apache_beam/examples/snippets/snippets_test.py tag:type_hints_takes %}```
 
 When you apply the Filter transform to the numbers collection in the example above, you'll be able to catch the error during pipeline construction.

 The following code declares an `int` type hint on `FilterEvensDoFn`, using the decorator `@with_input_types()`.

 ```
-{% github_sample /apache/beam/blob/master/sdks/python/apache_beam/examples/snippets/snippets_test.py tag:type_hints_do_fn %}```
 
 Decorators receive an arbitrary number of positional and/or keyword arguments, typically interpreted in the context of the function they're wrapping. Generally the first argument is a type hint for the main input, and additional arguments are type hints for side inputs.
 
+#### Disabling Annotations Use
+
+Since this style of type hint declaration is enabled by default, here are some ways to disable it.
+
+1. Using the `@beam.typehints.no_annotations` decorator on the specific function you want Beam to ignore annotations for.
+1. Declaring type hints using the decorator or inline methods above.
+These will take precedence over annotations.
+1. Calling `beam.typehints.disable_type_annotations()` before pipeline creation.
+This will prevent Beam from looking at annotations on all functions.

 ### Defining Generic Types
 
-You can use type hint annotations to define generic types. The following code specifies an input type hint that asserts the generic type `T`, and an output type hint that asserts the type `Tuple[int, T]`.

 ## Kinds of Type Hints
 
 You can use type hints with any class, including Python primitive types, container classes, and user-defined classes. All classes, such as `int`, `float`, and user-defined classes, can be used to define type hints, called **simple type hints**. Container types such as lists, tuples, and iterables, can also be used to define type hints and are called **parameterized type hints**. Finally, there are some special types that don't correspond to any concrete Python classes, such as `Any`, `Optional`, and `Union`, that are also permitted as type hints.
 
+Beam defines its own internal type hint types, which are still available for use for backward compatibility.
+It also supports Python's typing module types, which are internally converted to Beam internal types.
+> For new code, it is recommended to use [**typing**](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html) module types.

 ### Simple Type Hints
 
 Type hints can be of any class, from `int` and `str`, to user-defined classes. If you have a class as a type hint, you may want to define a coder for it.
