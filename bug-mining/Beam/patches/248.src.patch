 While we’d love to have a world where all runners support the full suite of semantics included in the Beam Model (formerly referred to as the [Dataflow Model](http://www.vldb.org/pvldb/vol8/p1792-Akidau.pdf)), practically speaking, there will always be certain features that some runners can’t provide. For example, a Hadoop-based runner would be inherently batch-based and may be unable to (easily) implement support for unbounded collections. However, that doesn’t prevent it from being extremely useful for a large set of uses. In other cases, the implementations provided by one runner may have slightly different semantics that those provided by another (e.g. even though the current suite of runners all support exactly-once delivery guarantees, an [Apache Samza](http://samza.apache.org/) runner, which would be a welcome addition, would currently only support at-least-once).
 
-To help clarify things, we’ve been working on enumerating the key features of the Beam model in a [capability matrix]({{ site.baseurl }}/learn/runners/capability-matrix/) for all existing runners, categorized around the four key questions addressed by the model: <span class="wwwh-what-dark">What</span> / <span class="wwwh-where-dark">Where</span> / <span class="wwwh-when-dark">When</span> / <span class="wwwh-how-dark">How</span> (if you’re not familiar with those questions, you might want to read through [Streaming 102](http://oreilly.com/ideas/the-world-beyond-batch-streaming-102) for an overview). This table will be maintained over time as the model evolves, our understanding grows, and runners are created or features added.
