+### Release integrity
+
+You *must* (verify)[https://www.apache.org/info/verification.html] the integrity
+of downloaded files. We provide OpenPGP signatures for every release file. This
+signature should be matched against the
+(KEYS)[https://www.apache.org/dist/beam/KEYS] file which contains the OpenPGP
+keys of Apache Beam's Release Managers. We also provide SHA-512 checksums for
+every release file (or SHA-1 and MD5 checksums for older releases). After you
+download the file, you should calculate a checksum for your download, and make
+sure it is the same as ours.
