 # Apache Beam Java SDK Quickstart
 
-This Quickstart will walk you through executing your first Beam pipeline to run [WordCount](/get-started/wordcount-example), written using Beam's [Java SDK](/documentation/sdks/java), on a [runner](/documentation#runners) of your choice.
+This quickstart shows you how to set up a Java development environment and run an [example pipeline](/get-started/wordcount-example) written with the [Apache Beam Java SDK](/documentation/sdks/java), using a [runner](/documentation#runners) of your choice.
 
 If you're interested in contributing to the Apache Beam Java codebase, see the [Contribution Guide](/contribute).

-## Run WordCount
+## Run a pipeline
 
-A single Beam pipeline can run on multiple Beam [runners](/documentation#runners), including the [FlinkRunner](/documentation/runners/flink), [SparkRunner](/documentation/runners/spark), [NemoRunner](/documentation/runners/nemo), [JetRunner](/documentation/runners/jet), or [DataflowRunner](/documentation/runners/dataflow). The [DirectRunner](/documentation/runners/direct) is a common runner for getting started, as it runs locally on your machine and requires no specific setup.

+The general process for running a pipeline goes like this:
 
 1.  Ensure you've done any runner-specific setup.
-1.  Build your commandline by:
-    1. Specifying a specific runner with `--runner=<runner>` (defaults to the [DirectRunner](/documentation/runners/direct))
-    1. Adding any runner-specific required options
-    1. Choosing input files and an output location are accessible on the chosen runner. (For example, you can't access a local file if you are running the pipeline on an external cluster.)
