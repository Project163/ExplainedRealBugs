+- Local:
+    - Manually installing the prerequisites listed above.
+    - Using the automated script for Linux and macOS.
+- Container: using a Docker image.

+##### Automated script for Linux and macOS
+
+You can install these in a Debian-based distribution for Linux or macOs using the [local-env-setup.sh](https://github.com/apache/beam/blob/master/local-env-setup.sh) script, which is part of the Beam repo. It contains:
+
+* pip3 packages
+* go packages
+* goavro

+To istall:
+
+1. Execute:
+```

+
+#### Container: Docker-based
 
 Alternatively, you can use the Docker based local development environment to wrap your clone of the Beam repo
 into a container meeting the requirements above.
 
 You can start this container using the [start-build-env.sh](https://github.com/apache/beam/blob/master/start-build-env.sh)
 script which is part of the Beam repo:

+                  $ go get -u ./...
+
+1. Check the environment was set up correctly.
+    - **Option 1**: validate the Go, Java, and Python environments:
+
+        **Important**: Make sure you have activated Python development.
+```
+./gradlew :checkSetup
+```
+    - **Option 2**: Run independent checks:
+        - For **Go development**:
+          1. Execute:
+```
+export GOLANG_PROTOBUF_REGISTRATION_CONFLICT=ignore
+./gradlew :sdks:go:examples:wordCount

+        - For **Java development**:
+          1. Execute:
+```
