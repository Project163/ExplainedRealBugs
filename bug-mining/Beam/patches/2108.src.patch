 ### Execution Mode

 Python [FnApiRunner](https://beam.apache.org/contribute/runner-guide/#the-fn-api) supports multi-threading and multi-processing mode.

 <strong>Setting parallelism</strong>

 Number of threads or subprocesses is defined by setting the `direct_num_workers` option.
-From 2.22.0, `direct_num_workers = 0` is supported. When `direct_num_workers` is set to 0, it will set the number of threads/subprocess to the number of cores of the machine where the pipelien is running.

 <strong>Setting running mode</strong>
 
+{:.language-py}
 From 2.19, a new option was added to set running mode. We can use `direct_running_mode` option to set the running mode.
 `direct_running_mode` can be one of [`'in_memory'`, `'multi_threading'`, `'multi_processing'`].
 
+{:.language-py}
 <b>in_memory</b>: Runner and workers' communication happens in memory (not through gRPC). This is a default mode.
 
+{:.language-py}
 <b>multi_threading</b>: Runner and workers communicate through gRPC and each worker runs in a thread.
 
+{:.language-py}
 <b>multi_processing</b>: Runner and workers communicate through gRPC and each worker runs in a subprocess.
 
+{:.language-py}
 Same as other options, `direct_running_mode` can be passed through CLI or set with `PipelineOptions`.
 
+{:.language-py}
 For the versions before 2.19.0, the running mode should be set with `FnApiRunner()`. Please refer following examples.
