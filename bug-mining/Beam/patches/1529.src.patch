+## Generated Go code fails to build
+
+Occasionally, after following the steps above and updating the generated .pb.go
+files, they may fail to build. This usually indicates a version mismatch in the
+[golang/protobuf](https://github.com/golang/protobuf) package. Specifically,
+the version of protoc-gen-go in the local Go workspace (used during
+`go generate`) differs from the cached version of golang/protobuf used for
+building Beam (specified in [gogradle.lock](https://github.com/apache/beam/blob/master/sdks/go/gogradle.lock)).
+
+The preferred way to fix this issue is to update the fixed Beam version of
+golang/protobuf to a recent commit. This can be done by manually changing the
+commit hash for golang/protobuf in [gogradle.lock](https://github.com/apache/beam/blob/master/sdks/go/gogradle.lock).
+
+If that fails due to dependency issues, an alternate approach is to downgrade
+the local version of protoc-gen-go to match the commit in gogradle.lock, with
+the following commands.
+
+```bash
+# Replace <commit hash> with the commit of golang/protobuf in gogradle.lock.
+go get -d -u github.com/golang/protobuf/protoc-gen-go
+git -C "$(go env GOPATH)"/src/github.com/golang/protobuf checkout <commit hash>
+go install github.com/golang/protobuf/protoc-gen-go
+```
+> **Note:** This leaves the local repository of protoc-gen-go in a detached
+> head state, which may cause problems when updating it in the future. To fix
+> this, navigate to the protoc-gen-go directory and run `git checkout master`.
