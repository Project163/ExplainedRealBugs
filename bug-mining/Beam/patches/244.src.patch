 The Google Cloud Dataflow Runner uses the [Cloud Dataflow managed service](https://cloud.google.com/dataflow/service/dataflow-service-desc). When you run your pipeline with the Cloud Dataflow service, the runner uploads your executable code and dependencies to a Google Cloud Storage bucket and creates a Cloud Dataflow job, which executes your pipeline on managed resources in Google Cloud Platform.
 
 The Cloud Dataflow Runner and service are suitable for large scale, continuous jobs, and provide:

 The Direct Runner executes pipelines on your machine and is designed to validate that pipelines adhere to the Apache Beam model as closely as possible. Instead of focusing on efficient pipeline execution, the Direct Runner performs additional checks to ensure that users do not rely on semantics that are not guaranteed by the model. Some of these checks include:

 Using the Direct Runner for testing and development helps ensure that pipelines are robust across different Beam runners. In addition, debugging failed runs can be a non-trivial task when a pipeline executes on a remote cluster. Instead, it is often faster and simpler to perform local unit testing on your pipeline code. Unit testing your pipeline locally also allows you to use your preferred local debugging tools.
 
 Here are some resources with information about how to test your pipelines.
