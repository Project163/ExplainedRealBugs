-                        THE PROLOGUE
-
-                        Enter Chorus.
-
-
-  Chor. Two households, both alike in dignity,
-    In fair Verona, where we lay our scene,
-    From ancient grudge break to new mutiny,
-    Where civil blood makes civil hands unclean.
-    From forth the fatal loins of these two foes
-    A pair of star-cross'd lovers take their life;
-    Whose misadventur'd piteous overthrows
-    Doth with their death bury their parents' strife.
-    The fearful passage of their death-mark'd love,
-    And the continuance of their parents' rage,
-    Which, but their children's end, naught could remove,
-    Is now the two hours' traffic of our stage;
-    The which if you with patient ears attend,
-    What here shall miss, our toil shall strive to mend.
-                                                         [Exit.]
-
-
-
-
-ACT I. Scene I.
-Verona. A public place.
-
-Enter Sampson and Gregory (with swords and bucklers) of the house
-of Capulet.
-
-
-  Samp. Gregory, on my word, we'll not carry coals.
-
-  Greg. No, for then we should be colliers.
-
-  Samp. I mean, an we be in choler, we'll draw.
-
-  Greg. Ay, while you live, draw your neck out of collar.
-
-  Samp. I strike quickly, being moved.
-
-  Greg. But thou art not quickly moved to strike.
-
-  Samp. A dog of the house of Montague moves me.
-
-  Greg. To move is to stir, and to be valiant is to stand.
-    Therefore, if thou art moved, thou runn'st away.
-
-  Samp. A dog of that house shall move me to stand. I will take
-    the wall of any man or maid of Montague's.
-
-  Greg. That shows thee a weak slave; for the weakest goes to the
-    wall.
-
-  Samp. 'Tis true; and therefore women, being the weaker vessels,
-    are ever thrust to the wall. Therefore I will push Montague's men
-    from the wall and thrust his maids to the wall.
-
-  Greg. The quarrel is between our masters and us their men.
-
-  Samp. 'Tis all one. I will show myself a tyrant. When I have
-    fought with the men, I will be cruel with the maids- I will cut off
-    their heads.
-
-  Greg. The heads of the maids?
-
-  Samp. Ay, the heads of the maids, or their maidenheads.
-    Take it in what sense thou wilt.
-
-  Greg. They must take it in sense that feel it.
-
-  Samp. Me they shall feel while I am able to stand; and 'tis known I
-    am a pretty piece of flesh.
-
-  Greg. 'Tis well thou art not fish; if thou hadst, thou hadst
-    been poor-John. Draw thy tool! Here comes two of the house of
-    Montagues.
-
-           Enter two other Servingmen [Abram and Balthasar].
-
-
-  Samp. My naked weapon is out. Quarrel! I will back thee.
-
-  Greg. How? turn thy back and run?
-
-  Samp. Fear me not.
-
-  Greg. No, marry. I fear thee!
-
-  Samp. Let us take the law of our sides; let them begin.
-
-  Greg. I will frown as I pass by, and let them take it as they list.
-
-  Samp. Nay, as they dare. I will bite my thumb at them; which is
-    disgrace to them, if they bear it.
-
-  Abr. Do you bite your thumb at us, sir?
-
-  Samp. I do bite my thumb, sir.
-
-  Abr. Do you bite your thumb at us, sir?
-
-  Samp. [aside to Gregory] Is the law of our side if I say ay?
-
-  Greg. [aside to Sampson] No.
-
-  Samp. No, sir, I do not bite my thumb at you, sir; but I bite my
-    thumb, sir.
-
-  Greg. Do you quarrel, sir?
-
-  Abr. Quarrel, sir? No, sir.
-
-  Samp. But if you do, sir, am for you. I serve as good a man as
-    you.
-
-  Abr. No better.
-
-  Samp. Well, sir.
-
-                        Enter Benvolio.
-
-
-  Greg. [aside to Sampson] Say 'better.' Here comes one of my
-    master's kinsmen.
-
-  Samp. Yes, better, sir.
-
-  Abr. You lie.
-
-  Samp. Draw, if you be men. Gregory, remember thy swashing blow.
-                                                     They fight.
-
-  Ben. Part, fools! [Beats down their swords.]
-    Put up your swords. You know not what you do.
-
-                          Enter Tybalt.
-
-
-  Tyb. What, art thou drawn among these heartless hinds?
-    Turn thee Benvolio! look upon thy death.
-
-  Ben. I do but keep the peace. Put up thy sword,
-    Or manage it to part these men with me.
-
-  Tyb. What, drawn, and talk of peace? I hate the word
-    As I hate hell, all Montagues, and thee.
-    Have at thee, coward!                            They fight.
-
-     Enter an officer, and three or four Citizens with clubs or
-                          partisans.
-
-
-  Officer. Clubs, bills, and partisans! Strike! beat them down!
-
-  Citizens. Down with the Capulets! Down with the Montagues!
-
-           Enter Old Capulet in his gown, and his Wife.
-
-
-  Cap. What noise is this? Give me my long sword, ho!
-
-  Wife. A crutch, a crutch! Why call you for a sword?
-
-  Cap. My sword, I say! Old Montague is come
-    And flourishes his blade in spite of me.
-
-                 Enter Old Montague and his Wife.
-
-
-  Mon. Thou villain Capulet!- Hold me not, let me go.
-
-  M. Wife. Thou shalt not stir one foot to seek a foe.
-
-                Enter Prince Escalus, with his Train.
-
-
-  Prince. Rebellious subjects, enemies to peace,
-    Profaners of this neighbour-stained steel-
-    Will they not hear? What, ho! you men, you beasts,
-    That quench the fire of your pernicious rage
-    With purple fountains issuing from your veins!
-    On pain of torture, from those bloody hands
-    Throw your mistempered weapons to the ground
-    And hear the sentence of your moved prince.
-    Three civil brawls, bred of an airy word
-    By thee, old Capulet, and Montague,
-    Have thrice disturb'd the quiet of our streets
-    And made Verona's ancient citizens
-    Cast by their grave beseeming ornaments
-    To wield old partisans, in hands as old,
-    Cank'red with peace, to part your cank'red hate.
-    If ever you disturb our streets again,
-    Your lives shall pay the forfeit of the peace.
-    For this time all the rest depart away.
-    You, Capulet, shall go along with me;
-    And, Montague, come you this afternoon,
-    To know our farther pleasure in this case,
-    To old Freetown, our common judgment place.
-    Once more, on pain of death, all men depart.
-              Exeunt [all but Montague, his Wife, and Benvolio].
-
-  Mon. Who set this ancient quarrel new abroach?
-    Speak, nephew, were you by when it began?
-
-  Ben. Here were the servants of your adversary
-    And yours, close fighting ere I did approach.
-    I drew to part them. In the instant came
-    The fiery Tybalt, with his sword prepar'd;
-    Which, as he breath'd defiance to my ears,
-    He swung about his head and cut the winds,
-    Who, nothing hurt withal, hiss'd him in scorn.
-    While we were interchanging thrusts and blows,
-    Came more and more, and fought on part and part,
-    Till the Prince came, who parted either part.
-
-  M. Wife. O, where is Romeo? Saw you him to-day?
-    Right glad I am he was not at this fray.
-
-  Ben. Madam, an hour before the worshipp'd sun
-    Peer'd forth the golden window of the East,
-    A troubled mind drave me to walk abroad;
-    Where, underneath the grove of sycamore
-    That westward rooteth from the city's side,
-    So early walking did I see your son.
-    Towards him I made; but he was ware of me
-    And stole into the covert of the wood.
-    I- measuring his affections by my own,
-    Which then most sought where most might not be found,
-    Being one too many by my weary self-
-    Pursu'd my humour, not Pursuing his,
-    And gladly shunn'd who gladly fled from me.
-
-  Mon. Many a morning hath he there been seen,
-    With tears augmenting the fresh morning's dew,
-    Adding to clouds more clouds with his deep sighs;
-    But all so soon as the all-cheering sun
-    Should in the furthest East bean to draw
-    The shady curtains from Aurora's bed,
-    Away from light steals home my heavy son
-    And private in his chamber pens himself,
-    Shuts up his windows, locks fair daylight
-    And makes himself an artificial night.
-    Black and portentous must this humour prove
-    Unless good counsel may the cause remove.
-
-  Ben. My noble uncle, do you know the cause?
-
-  Mon. I neither know it nor can learn of him
-
-  Ben. Have you importun'd him by any means?
-
-  Mon. Both by myself and many other friend;
-    But he, his own affections' counsellor,
-    Is to himself- I will not say how true-
-    But to himself so secret and so close,
-    So far from sounding and discovery,
-    As is the bud bit with an envious worm
-    Ere he can spread his sweet leaves to the air
-    Or dedicate his beauty to the sun.
-    Could we but learn from whence his sorrows grow,
-    We would as willingly give cure as know.
-
-                       Enter Romeo.
-
-
-  Ben. See, where he comes. So please you step aside,
-    I'll know his grievance, or be much denied.
-
-  Mon. I would thou wert so happy by thy stay
-    To hear true shrift. Come, madam, let's away,
-                                     Exeunt [Montague and Wife].
-
-  Ben. Good morrow, cousin.
-
-  Rom. Is the day so young?
-
-  Ben. But new struck nine.
-
-  Rom. Ay me! sad hours seem long.
-    Was that my father that went hence so fast?
-
-  Ben. It was. What sadness lengthens Romeo's hours?
-
-  Rom. Not having that which having makes them short.
-
-  Ben. In love?
-
-  Rom. Out-
-
-  Ben. Of love?
-
-  Rom. Out of her favour where I am in love.
-
-  Ben. Alas that love, so gentle in his view,
-    Should be so tyrannous and rough in proof!
-
-  Rom. Alas that love, whose view is muffled still,
-    Should without eyes see pathways to his will!
-    Where shall we dine? O me! What fray was here?
-    Yet tell me not, for I have heard it all.
-    Here's much to do with hate, but more with love.
-    Why then, O brawling love! O loving hate!
-    O anything, of nothing first create!
-    O heavy lightness! serious vanity!
-    Misshapen chaos of well-seeming forms!
-    Feather of lead, bright smoke, cold fire, sick health!
-    Still-waking sleep, that is not what it is
-    This love feel I, that feel no love in this.
-    Dost thou not laugh?
-
-  Ben. No, coz, I rather weep.
-
-  Rom. Good heart, at what?
-
-  Ben. At thy good heart's oppression.
-
-  Rom. Why, such is love's transgression.
-    Griefs of mine own lie heavy in my breast,
-    Which thou wilt propagate, to have it prest
-    With more of thine. This love that thou hast shown
-    Doth add more grief to too much of mine own.
-    Love is a smoke rais'd with the fume of sighs;
-    Being purg'd, a fire sparkling in lovers' eyes;
-    Being vex'd, a sea nourish'd with lovers' tears.
-    What is it else? A madness most discreet,
-    A choking gall, and a preserving sweet.
-    Farewell, my coz.
-
-  Ben. Soft! I will go along.
-    An if you leave me so, you do me wrong.
-
-  Rom. Tut! I have lost myself; I am not here:
-    This is not Romeo, he's some other where.
-
-  Ben. Tell me in sadness, who is that you love?
-
-  Rom. What, shall I groan and tell thee?
-
-  Ben. Groan? Why, no;
-    But sadly tell me who.
-
-  Rom. Bid a sick man in sadness make his will.
-    Ah, word ill urg'd to one that is so ill!
-    In sadness, cousin, I do love a woman.
-
-  Ben. I aim'd so near when I suppos'd you lov'd.
-
-  Rom. A right good markman! And she's fair I love.
-
-  Ben. A right fair mark, fair coz, is soonest hit.
-
-  Rom. Well, in that hit you miss. She'll not be hit
-    With Cupid's arrow. She hath Dian's wit,
-    And, in strong proof of chastity well arm'd,
-    From Love's weak childish bow she lives unharm'd.
-    She will not stay the siege of loving terms,
-    Nor bide th' encounter of assailing eyes,
-    Nor ope her lap to saint-seducing gold.
-    O, she's rich in beauty; only poor
-    That, when she dies, with beauty dies her store.
-
-  Ben. Then she hath sworn that she will still live chaste?
-
-  Rom. She hath, and in that sparing makes huge waste;
-    For beauty, starv'd with her severity,
-    Cuts beauty off from all posterity.
-    She is too fair, too wise, wisely too fair,
-    To merit bliss by making me despair.
-    She hath forsworn to love, and in that vow
-    Do I live dead that live to tell it now.
-
-  Ben. Be rul'd by me: forget to think of her.
-
-  Rom. O, teach me how I should forget to think!
-
-  Ben. By giving liberty unto thine eyes.
-    Examine other beauties.
-
-  Rom. 'Tis the way
-    To call hers (exquisite) in question more.
-    These happy masks that kiss fair ladies' brows,
-    Being black puts us in mind they hide the fair.
-    He that is strucken blind cannot forget
-    The precious treasure of his eyesight lost.
-    Show me a mistress that is passing fair,
-    What doth her beauty serve but as a note
-    Where I may read who pass'd that passing fair?
-    Farewell. Thou canst not teach me to forget.
-
-  Ben. I'll pay that doctrine, or else die in debt.      Exeunt.
-
-
-
-
-Scene II.
-A Street.
-
-Enter Capulet, County Paris, and [Servant] -the Clown.
-
-
-  Cap. But Montague is bound as well as I,
-    In penalty alike; and 'tis not hard, I think,
-    For men so old as we to keep the peace.
-
-  Par. Of honourable reckoning are you both,
-    And pity 'tis you liv'd at odds so long.
-    But now, my lord, what say you to my suit?
-
-  Cap. But saying o'er what I have said before:
-    My child is yet a stranger in the world,
-    She hath not seen the change of fourteen years;
-    Let two more summers wither in their pride
-    Ere we may think her ripe to be a bride.
-
-  Par. Younger than she are happy mothers made.
-
-  Cap. And too soon marr'd are those so early made.
-    The earth hath swallowed all my hopes but she;
-    She is the hopeful lady of my earth.
-    But woo her, gentle Paris, get her heart;
-    My will to her consent is but a part.
-    An she agree, within her scope of choice
-    Lies my consent and fair according voice.
-    This night I hold an old accustom'd feast,
-    Whereto I have invited many a guest,
-    Such as I love; and you among the store,
-    One more, most welcome, makes my number more.
-    At my poor house look to behold this night
-    Earth-treading stars that make dark heaven light.
-    Such comfort as do lusty young men feel
-    When well apparell'd April on the heel
-    Of limping Winter treads, even such delight
-    Among fresh female buds shall you this night
-    Inherit at my house. Hear all, all see,
-    And like her most whose merit most shall be;
-    Which, on more view of many, mine, being one,
-    May stand in number, though in reck'ning none.
-    Come, go with me. [To Servant, giving him a paper] Go,
-    sirrah, trudge about
-    Through fair Verona; find those persons out
-    Whose names are written there, and to them say,
-    My house and welcome on their pleasure stay-
-                                     Exeunt [Capulet and Paris].
-
-  Serv. Find them out whose names are written here? It is written
-    that the shoemaker should meddle with his yard and the tailor
-    with his last, the fisher with his pencil and the painter
-    with his nets; but I am sent to find those persons whose names are
-    here writ, and can never find what names the writing person
-    hath here writ. I must to the learned. In good time!
-
-                   Enter Benvolio and Romeo.
-
-
-  Ben. Tut, man, one fire burns out another's burning;
-    One pain is lessoned by another's anguish;
-    Turn giddy, and be holp by backward turning;
-    One desperate grief cures with another's languish.
-    Take thou some new infection to thy eye,
-    And the rank poison of the old will die.
-
-  Rom. Your plantain leaf is excellent for that.
-
-  Ben. For what, I pray thee?
-
-  Rom. For your broken shin.
-
-  Ben. Why, Romeo, art thou mad?
-
-  Rom. Not mad, but bound more than a madman is;
-    Shut up in Prison, kept without my food,
-    Whipp'd and tormented and- God-den, good fellow.
-
-  Serv. God gi' go-den. I pray, sir, can you read?
-
-  Rom. Ay, mine own fortune in my misery.
-
-  Serv. Perhaps you have learned it without book. But I pray, can
-    you read anything you see?
-
-  Rom. Ay, If I know the letters and the language.
-
-  Serv. Ye say honestly. Rest you merry!
-
-  Rom. Stay, fellow; I can read.                       He reads.
-
-      'Signior Martino and his wife and daughters;
-      County Anselmo and his beauteous sisters;
-      The lady widow of Vitruvio;
-      Signior Placentio and His lovely nieces;
-      Mercutio and his brother Valentine;
-      Mine uncle Capulet, his wife, and daughters;
-      My fair niece Rosaline and Livia;
-      Signior Valentio and His cousin Tybalt;
-      Lucio and the lively Helena.'
-
-    [Gives back the paper.] A fair assembly. Whither should they
-    come?
-
-  Serv. Up.
-
-  Rom. Whither?
-
-  Serv. To supper, to our house.
-
-  Rom. Whose house?
-
-  Serv. My master's.
-
-  Rom. Indeed I should have ask'd you that before.
-
-  Serv. Now I'll tell you without asking. My master is the great
-    rich Capulet; and if you be not of the house of Montagues, I pray
-    come and crush a cup of wine. Rest you merry!               Exit.
-
-  Ben. At this same ancient feast of Capulet's
-    Sups the fair Rosaline whom thou so lov'st;
-    With all the admired beauties of Verona.
-    Go thither, and with unattainted eye
-    Compare her face with some that I shall show,
-    And I will make thee think thy swan a crow.
-
-  Rom. When the devout religion of mine eye
-    Maintains such falsehood, then turn tears to fires;
-    And these, who, often drown'd, could never die,
-    Transparent heretics, be burnt for liars!
-    One fairer than my love? The all-seeing sun
-    Ne'er saw her match since first the world begun.
-
-  Ben. Tut! you saw her fair, none else being by,
-    Herself pois'd with herself in either eye;
-    But in that crystal scales let there be weigh'd
-    Your lady's love against some other maid
-    That I will show you shining at this feast,
-    And she shall scant show well that now seems best.
-
-  Rom. I'll go along, no such sight to be shown,
-    But to rejoice in splendour of my own.              [Exeunt.]

-Scene III.
-Capulet's house.
-
-Enter Capulet's Wife, and Nurse.
-
-
-  Wife. Nurse, where's my daughter? Call her forth to me.
-
-  Nurse. Now, by my maidenhead at twelve year old,
-    I bade her come. What, lamb! what ladybird!
-    God forbid! Where's this girl? What, Juliet!
-
-                         Enter Juliet.
-
-
-  Jul. How now? Who calls?
-
-  Nurse. Your mother.
-
-  Jul. Madam, I am here.
-    What is your will?
-
-  Wife. This is the matter- Nurse, give leave awhile,
-    We must talk in secret. Nurse, come back again;
-    I have rememb'red me, thou's hear our counsel.
-    Thou knowest my daughter's of a pretty age.
-
-  Nurse. Faith, I can tell her age unto an hour.
-
-  Wife. She's not fourteen.
-
-  Nurse. I'll lay fourteen of my teeth-
-    And yet, to my teen be it spoken, I have but four-
-    She is not fourteen. How long is it now
-    To Lammastide?
-
-  Wife. A fortnight and odd days.
-
-  Nurse. Even or odd, of all days in the year,
-    Come Lammas Eve at night shall she be fourteen.
-    Susan and she (God rest all Christian souls!)
-    Were of an age. Well, Susan is with God;
-    She was too good for me. But, as I said,
-    On Lammas Eve at night shall she be fourteen;
-    That shall she, marry; I remember it well.
-    'Tis since the earthquake now eleven years;
-    And she was wean'd (I never shall forget it),
-    Of all the days of the year, upon that day;
-    For I had then laid wormwood to my dug,
-    Sitting in the sun under the dovehouse wall.
-    My lord and you were then at Mantua.
-    Nay, I do bear a brain. But, as I said,
-    When it did taste the wormwood on the nipple
-    Of my dug and felt it bitter, pretty fool,
-    To see it tetchy and fall out with the dug!
-    Shake, quoth the dovehouse! 'Twas no need, I trow,
-    To bid me trudge.
-    And since that time it is eleven years,
-    For then she could stand high-lone; nay, by th' rood,
-    She could have run and waddled all about;
-    For even the day before, she broke her brow;
-    And then my husband (God be with his soul!
-    'A was a merry man) took up the child.
-    'Yea,' quoth he, 'dost thou fall upon thy face?
-    Thou wilt fall backward when thou hast more wit;
-    Wilt thou not, Jule?' and, by my holidam,
-    The pretty wretch left crying, and said 'Ay.'
-    To see now how a jest shall come about!
-    I warrant, an I should live a thousand yeas,
-    I never should forget it. 'Wilt thou not, Jule?' quoth he,
-    And, pretty fool, it stinted, and said 'Ay.'
-
-  Wife. Enough of this. I pray thee hold thy peace.
-
-  Nurse. Yes, madam. Yet I cannot choose but laugh
-    To think it should leave crying and say 'Ay.'
-    And yet, I warrant, it bad upon it brow
-    A bump as big as a young cock'rel's stone;
-    A perilous knock; and it cried bitterly.
-    'Yea,' quoth my husband, 'fall'st upon thy face?
-    Thou wilt fall backward when thou comest to age;
-    Wilt thou not, Jule?' It stinted, and said 'Ay.'
-
-  Jul. And stint thou too, I pray thee, nurse, say I.
-
-  Nurse. Peace, I have done. God mark thee to his grace!
-    Thou wast the prettiest babe that e'er I nurs'd.
-    An I might live to see thee married once, I have my wish.
-
-  Wife. Marry, that 'marry' is the very theme
-    I came to talk of. Tell me, daughter Juliet,
-    How stands your disposition to be married?
-
-  Jul. It is an honour that I dream not of.
-
-  Nurse. An honour? Were not I thine only nurse,
-    I would say thou hadst suck'd wisdom from thy teat.
-
-  Wife. Well, think of marriage now. Younger than you,
-    Here in Verona, ladies of esteem,
-    Are made already mothers. By my count,
-    I was your mother much upon these years
-    That you are now a maid. Thus then in brief:
-    The valiant Paris seeks you for his love.
-
-  Nurse. A man, young lady! lady, such a man
-    As all the world- why he's a man of wax.
-
-  Wife. Verona's summer hath not such a flower.
-
-  Nurse. Nay, he's a flower, in faith- a very flower.
-
-  Wife. What say you? Can you love the gentleman?
-    This night you shall behold him at our feast.
-    Read o'er the volume of young Paris' face,
-    And find delight writ there with beauty's pen;
-    Examine every married lineament,
-    And see how one another lends content;
-    And what obscur'd in this fair volume lies
-    Find written in the margent of his eyes,
-    This precious book of love, this unbound lover,
-    To beautify him only lacks a cover.
-    The fish lives in the sea, and 'tis much pride
-    For fair without the fair within to hide.
-    That book in many's eyes doth share the glory,
-    That in gold clasps locks in the golden story;
-    So shall you share all that he doth possess,
-    By having him making yourself no less.
-
-  Nurse. No less? Nay, bigger! Women grow by men
-
-  Wife. Speak briefly, can you like of Paris' love?
-
-  Jul. I'll look to like, if looking liking move;
-    But no more deep will I endart mine eye
-    Than your consent gives strength to make it fly.
-
-                        Enter Servingman.
-
-
-  Serv. Madam, the guests are come, supper serv'd up, you call'd,
-    my young lady ask'd for, the nurse curs'd in the pantry, and
-    everything in extremity. I must hence to wait. I beseech you
-    follow straight.
-
-  Wife. We follow thee.                       Exit [Servingman].
-    Juliet, the County stays.
-
-  Nurse. Go, girl, seek happy nights to happy days.
-                                                         Exeunt.
-
-
-
-
-Scene IV.
-A street.
-
-Enter Romeo, Mercutio, Benvolio, with five or six other Maskers;
-Torchbearers.
-
-
-  Rom. What, shall this speech be spoke for our excuse?
-    Or shall we on without apology?
-
-  Ben. The date is out of such prolixity.
-    We'll have no Cupid hoodwink'd with a scarf,
-    Bearing a Tartar's painted bow of lath,
-    Scaring the ladies like a crowkeeper;
-    Nor no without-book prologue, faintly spoke
-    After the prompter, for our entrance;
-    But, let them measure us by what they will,
-    We'll measure them a measure, and be gone.
-
-  Rom. Give me a torch. I am not for this ambling.
-    Being but heavy, I will bear the light.
-
-  Mer. Nay, gentle Romeo, we must have you dance.
-
-  Rom. Not I, believe me. You have dancing shoes
-    With nimble soles; I have a soul of lead
-    So stakes me to the ground I cannot move.
-
-  Mer. You are a lover. Borrow Cupid's wings
-    And soar with them above a common bound.
-
-  Rom. I am too sore enpierced with his shaft
-    To soar with his light feathers; and so bound
-    I cannot bound a pitch above dull woe.
-    Under love's heavy burthen do I sink.
-
-  Mer. And, to sink in it, should you burthen love-
-    Too great oppression for a tender thing.
-
-  Rom. Is love a tender thing? It is too rough,
-    Too rude, too boist'rous, and it pricks like thorn.
-
-  Mer. If love be rough with you, be rough with love.
-    Prick love for pricking, and you beat love down.
-    Give me a case to put my visage in.
-    A visor for a visor! What care I
-    What curious eye doth quote deformities?
-    Here are the beetle brows shall blush for me.
-
-  Ben. Come, knock and enter; and no sooner in
-    But every man betake him to his legs.
-
-  Rom. A torch for me! Let wantons light of heart
-    Tickle the senseless rushes with their heels;
-    For I am proverb'd with a grandsire phrase,
-    I'll be a candle-holder and look on;
-    The game was ne'er so fair, and I am done.
-
-  Mer. Tut! dun's the mouse, the constable's own word!
-    If thou art Dun, we'll draw thee from the mire
-    Of this sir-reverence love, wherein thou stick'st
-    Up to the ears. Come, we burn daylight, ho!
-
-  Rom. Nay, that's not so.
-
-  Mer. I mean, sir, in delay
-    We waste our lights in vain, like lamps by day.
-    Take our good meaning, for our judgment sits
-    Five times in that ere once in our five wits.
-
-  Rom. And we mean well, in going to this masque;
-    But 'tis no wit to go.
-
-  Mer. Why, may one ask?
-
-  Rom. I dreamt a dream to-night.
-
-  Mer. And so did I.
-
-  Rom. Well, what was yours?
-
-  Mer. That dreamers often lie.
-
-  Rom. In bed asleep, while they do dream things true.
-
-  Mer. O, then I see Queen Mab hath been with you.
-    She is the fairies' midwife, and she comes
-    In shape no bigger than an agate stone
-    On the forefinger of an alderman,
-    Drawn with a team of little atomies
-    Athwart men's noses as they lie asleep;
-    Her wagon spokes made of long spinners' legs,
-    The cover, of the wings of grasshoppers;
-    Her traces, of the smallest spider's web;
-    Her collars, of the moonshine's wat'ry beams;
-    Her whip, of cricket's bone; the lash, of film;
-    Her wagoner, a small grey-coated gnat,
-    Not half so big as a round little worm
-    Prick'd from the lazy finger of a maid;
-    Her chariot is an empty hazelnut,
-    Made by the joiner squirrel or old grub,
-    Time out o' mind the fairies' coachmakers.
-    And in this state she 'gallops night by night
-    Through lovers' brains, and then they dream of love;
-    O'er courtiers' knees, that dream on cursies straight;
-    O'er lawyers' fingers, who straight dream on fees;
-    O'er ladies' lips, who straight on kisses dream,
-    Which oft the angry Mab with blisters plagues,
-    Because their breaths with sweetmeats tainted are.
-    Sometime she gallops o'er a courtier's nose,
-    And then dreams he of smelling out a suit;
-    And sometime comes she with a tithe-pig's tail
-    Tickling a parson's nose as 'a lies asleep,
-    Then dreams he of another benefice.
-    Sometimes she driveth o'er a soldier's neck,
-    And then dreams he of cutting foreign throats,
-    Of breaches, ambuscadoes, Spanish blades,
-    Of healths five fadom deep; and then anon
-    Drums in his ear, at which he starts and wakes,
-    And being thus frighted, swears a prayer or two
-    And sleeps again. This is that very Mab
-    That plats the manes of horses in the night
-    And bakes the elflocks in foul sluttish, hairs,
-    Which once untangled much misfortune bodes
-    This is the hag, when maids lie on their backs,
-    That presses them and learns them first to bear,
-    Making them women of good carriage.
-    This is she-
-
-  Rom. Peace, peace, Mercutio, peace!
-    Thou talk'st of nothing.
-
-  Mer. True, I talk of dreams;
-    Which are the children of an idle brain,
-    Begot of nothing but vain fantasy;
-    Which is as thin of substance as the air,
-    And more inconstant than the wind, who wooes
-    Even now the frozen bosom of the North
-    And, being anger'd, puffs away from thence,
-    Turning his face to the dew-dropping South.
-
-  Ben. This wind you talk of blows us from ourselves.
-    Supper is done, and we shall come too late.
-
-  Rom. I fear, too early; for my mind misgives
-    Some consequence, yet hanging in the stars,
-    Shall bitterly begin his fearful date
-    With this night's revels and expire the term
-    Of a despised life, clos'd in my breast,
-    By some vile forfeit of untimely death.
-    But he that hath the steerage of my course
-    Direct my sail! On, lusty gentlemen!
-
-  Ben. Strike, drum.
-                           They march about the stage. [Exeunt.]
-
-
-
-
-Scene V.
-Capulet's house.
-
-Servingmen come forth with napkins.
-
-  1. Serv. Where's Potpan, that he helps not to take away?
-    He shift a trencher! he scrape a trencher!
-  2. Serv. When good manners shall lie all in one or two men's
-    hands, and they unwash'd too, 'tis a foul thing.
-  1. Serv. Away with the join-stools, remove the court-cubbert,
-    look to the plate. Good thou, save me a piece of marchpane and, as
-    thou loves me, let the porter let in Susan Grindstone and
-Nell.
-    Anthony, and Potpan!
-  2. Serv. Ay, boy, ready.
-  1. Serv. You are look'd for and call'd for, ask'd for and
-    sought for, in the great chamber.
-  3. Serv. We cannot be here and there too. Cheerly, boys!
-    Be brisk awhile, and the longer liver take all.      Exeunt.
-
-    Enter the Maskers, Enter, [with Servants,] Capulet, his Wife,
-              Juliet, Tybalt, and all the Guests
-               and Gentlewomen to the Maskers.
-
-
-  Cap. Welcome, gentlemen! Ladies that have their toes
-    Unplagu'd with corns will have a bout with you.
-    Ah ha, my mistresses! which of you all
-    Will now deny to dance? She that makes dainty,
-    She I'll swear hath corns. Am I come near ye now?
-    Welcome, gentlemen! I have seen the day
-    That I have worn a visor and could tell
-    A whispering tale in a fair lady's ear,
-    Such as would please. 'Tis gone, 'tis gone, 'tis gone!
-    You are welcome, gentlemen! Come, musicians, play.
-    A hall, a hall! give room! and foot it, girls.
-                                    Music plays, and they dance.
-    More light, you knaves! and turn the tables up,
-    And quench the fire, the room is grown too hot.
-    Ah, sirrah, this unlook'd-for sport comes well.
-    Nay, sit, nay, sit, good cousin Capulet,
-    For you and I are past our dancing days.
-    How long is't now since last yourself and I
-    Were in a mask?
-  2. Cap. By'r Lady, thirty years.
-
-  Cap. What, man? 'Tis not so much, 'tis not so much!
-    'Tis since the nuptial of Lucentio,
-    Come Pentecost as quickly as it will,
-    Some five-and-twenty years, and then we mask'd.
-  2. Cap. 'Tis more, 'tis more! His son is elder, sir;
-    His son is thirty.
-
-  Cap. Will you tell me that?
-    His son was but a ward two years ago.
-
-  Rom. [to a Servingman] What lady's that, which doth enrich the
-    hand Of yonder knight?
-
-  Serv. I know not, sir.
-
-  Rom. O, she doth teach the torches to burn bright!
-    It seems she hangs upon the cheek of night
-    Like a rich jewel in an Ethiop's ear-
-    Beauty too rich for use, for earth too dear!
-    So shows a snowy dove trooping with crows
-    As yonder lady o'er her fellows shows.
-    The measure done, I'll watch her place of stand
-    And, touching hers, make blessed my rude hand.
-    Did my heart love till now? Forswear it, sight!
-    For I ne'er saw true beauty till this night.
-
-  Tyb. This, by his voice, should be a Montague.
-    Fetch me my rapier, boy. What, dares the slave
-    Come hither, cover'd with an antic face,
-    To fleer and scorn at our solemnity?
-    Now, by the stock and honour of my kin,
-    To strike him dead I hold it not a sin.
-
-  Cap. Why, how now, kinsman? Wherefore storm you so?
-
-  Tyb. Uncle, this is a Montague, our foe;
-    A villain, that is hither come in spite
-    To scorn at our solemnity this night.
-
-  Cap. Young Romeo is it?
-
-  Tyb. 'Tis he, that villain Romeo.
-
-  Cap. Content thee, gentle coz, let him alone.
-    'A bears him like a portly gentleman,
-    And, to say truth, Verona brags of him
-    To be a virtuous and well-govern'd youth.
-    I would not for the wealth of all this town
-    Here in my house do him disparagement.
-    Therefore be patient, take no note of him.
-    It is my will; the which if thou respect,
-    Show a fair presence and put off these frowns,
-    An ill-beseeming semblance for a feast.
-
-  Tyb. It fits when such a villain is a guest.
-    I'll not endure him.
-
-  Cap. He shall be endur'd.
-    What, goodman boy? I say he shall. Go to!
-    Am I the master here, or you? Go to!
-    You'll not endure him? God shall mend my soul!
-    You'll make a mutiny among my guests!
-    You will set cock-a-hoop! you'll be the man!
-
-  Tyb. Why, uncle, 'tis a shame.
-
-  Cap. Go to, go to!
-    You are a saucy boy. Is't so, indeed?
-    This trick may chance to scathe you. I know what.
-    You must contrary me! Marry, 'tis time.-
-    Well said, my hearts!- You are a princox- go!
-    Be quiet, or- More light, more light!- For shame!
-    I'll make you quiet; what!- Cheerly, my hearts!
-
-  Tyb. Patience perforce with wilful choler meeting
-    Makes my flesh tremble in their different greeting.
-    I will withdraw; but this intrusion shall,
-    Now seeming sweet, convert to bitt'rest gall.          Exit.
-
-  Rom. If I profane with my unworthiest hand
-    This holy shrine, the gentle fine is this:
-    My lips, two blushing pilgrims, ready stand
-    To smooth that rough touch with a tender kiss.
-
-  Jul. Good pilgrim, you do wrong your hand too much,
-    Which mannerly devotion shows in this;
-    For saints have hands that pilgrims' hands do touch,
-    And palm to palm is holy palmers' kiss.
-
-  Rom. Have not saints lips, and holy palmers too?
-
-  Jul. Ay, pilgrim, lips that they must use in pray'r.
-
-  Rom. O, then, dear saint, let lips do what hands do!
-    They pray; grant thou, lest faith turn to despair.
-
-  Jul. Saints do not move, though grant for prayers' sake.
-
-  Rom. Then move not while my prayer's effect I take.
-    Thus from my lips, by thine my sin is purg'd.  [Kisses her.]
-
-  Jul. Then have my lips the sin that they have took.
-
-  Rom. Sin from my lips? O trespass sweetly urg'd!
-    Give me my sin again.                          [Kisses her.]
-
-  Jul. You kiss by th' book.
-
-  Nurse. Madam, your mother craves a word with you.
-
-  Rom. What is her mother?
-
-  Nurse. Marry, bachelor,
-    Her mother is the lady of the house.
-    And a good lady, and a wise and virtuous.
-    I nurs'd her daughter that you talk'd withal.
-    I tell you, he that can lay hold of her
-    Shall have the chinks.
-
-  Rom. Is she a Capulet?
-    O dear account! my life is my foe's debt.
-
-  Ben. Away, be gone; the sport is at the best.
-
-  Rom. Ay, so I fear; the more is my unrest.
-
-  Cap. Nay, gentlemen, prepare not to be gone;
-    We have a trifling foolish banquet towards.
-    Is it e'en so? Why then, I thank you all.
-    I thank you, honest gentlemen. Good night.
-    More torches here! [Exeunt Maskers.] Come on then, let's to bed.
-    Ah, sirrah, by my fay, it waxes late;
-    I'll to my rest.
-                              Exeunt [all but Juliet and Nurse].
-
-  Jul. Come hither, nurse. What is yond gentleman?
-
-  Nurse. The son and heir of old Tiberio.
-
-  Jul. What's he that now is going out of door?
-
-  Nurse. Marry, that, I think, be young Petruchio.
-
-  Jul. What's he that follows there, that would not dance?
-
-  Nurse. I know not.
-
-  Jul. Go ask his name.- If he be married,
-    My grave is like to be my wedding bed.
-
-  Nurse. His name is Romeo, and a Montague,
-    The only son of your great enemy.
-
-  Jul. My only love, sprung from my only hate!
-    Too early seen unknown, and known too late!
-    Prodigious birth of love it is to me
-    That I must love a loathed enemy.
-
-  Nurse. What's this? what's this?
-
-  Jul. A rhyme I learnt even now
-    Of one I danc'd withal.
-                                     One calls within, 'Juliet.'
-
-  Nurse. Anon, anon!
-    Come, let's away; the strangers all are gone.        Exeunt.

-PROLOGUE
-
-Enter Chorus.
-
-
-  Chor. Now old desire doth in his deathbed lie,
-    And young affection gapes to be his heir;
-    That fair for which love groan'd for and would die,
-    With tender Juliet match'd, is now not fair.
-    Now Romeo is belov'd, and loves again,
-    Alike bewitched by the charm of looks;
-    But to his foe suppos'd he must complain,
-    And she steal love's sweet bait from fearful hooks.
-    Being held a foe, he may not have access
-    To breathe such vows as lovers use to swear,
-    And she as much in love, her means much less
-    To meet her new beloved anywhere;
-    But passion lends them power, time means, to meet,
-    Temp'ring extremities with extreme sweet.
-Exit.

-ACT II. Scene I.
-A lane by the wall of Capulet's orchard.
-
-Enter Romeo alone.
-
-
-  Rom. Can I go forward when my heart is here?
-    Turn back, dull earth, and find thy centre out.
-                     [Climbs the wall and leaps down within it.]
-
-                   Enter Benvolio with Mercutio.
-
-
-  Ben. Romeo! my cousin Romeo! Romeo!
-
-  Mer. He is wise,
-    And, on my life, hath stol'n him home to bed.
-
-  Ben. He ran this way, and leapt this orchard wall.
-    Call, good Mercutio.
-
-  Mer. Nay, I'll conjure too.
-    Romeo! humours! madman! passion! lover!
-    Appear thou in the likeness of a sigh;
-    Speak but one rhyme, and I am satisfied!
-    Cry but 'Ay me!' pronounce but 'love' and 'dove';
-    Speak to my gossip Venus one fair word,
-    One nickname for her purblind son and heir,
-    Young Adam Cupid, he that shot so trim
-    When King Cophetua lov'd the beggar maid!
-    He heareth not, he stirreth not, be moveth not;
-    The ape is dead, and I must conjure him.
-    I conjure thee by Rosaline's bright eyes.
-    By her high forehead and her scarlet lip,
-    By her fine foot, straight leg, and quivering thigh,
-    And the demesnes that there adjacent lie,
-    That in thy likeness thou appear to us!
-
-  Ben. An if he hear thee, thou wilt anger him.
-
-  Mer. This cannot anger him. 'Twould anger him
-    To raise a spirit in his mistress' circle
-    Of some strange nature, letting it there stand
-    Till she had laid it and conjur'd it down.
-    That were some spite; my invocation
-    Is fair and honest: in his mistress' name,
-    I conjure only but to raise up him.
-
-  Ben. Come, he hath hid himself among these trees
-    To be consorted with the humorous night.
-    Blind is his love and best befits the dark.
-
-  Mer. If love be blind, love cannot hit the mark.
-    Now will he sit under a medlar tree
-    And wish his mistress were that kind of fruit
-    As maids call medlars when they laugh alone.
-    O, Romeo, that she were, O that she were
-    An open et cetera, thou a pop'rin pear!
-    Romeo, good night. I'll to my truckle-bed;
-    This field-bed is too cold for me to sleep.
-    Come, shall we go?
-
-  Ben. Go then, for 'tis in vain
-    'To seek him here that means not to be found.
-                                                         Exeunt.
-
-
-
-
-Scene II.
-Capulet's orchard.
-
-Enter Romeo.
-
-
-  Rom. He jests at scars that never felt a wound.
-
-                     Enter Juliet above at a window.
-
-    But soft! What light through yonder window breaks?
-    It is the East, and Juliet is the sun!
-    Arise, fair sun, and kill the envious moon,
-    Who is already sick and pale with grief
-    That thou her maid art far more fair than she.
-    Be not her maid, since she is envious.
-    Her vestal livery is but sick and green,
-    And none but fools do wear it. Cast it off.
-    It is my lady; O, it is my love!
-    O that she knew she were!
-    She speaks, yet she says nothing. What of that?
-    Her eye discourses; I will answer it.
-    I am too bold; 'tis not to me she speaks.
-    Two of the fairest stars in all the heaven,
-    Having some business, do entreat her eyes
-    To twinkle in their spheres till they return.
-    What if her eyes were there, they in her head?
-    The brightness of her cheek would shame those stars
-    As daylight doth a lamp; her eyes in heaven
-    Would through the airy region stream so bright
-    That birds would sing and think it were not night.
-    See how she leans her cheek upon her hand!
-    O that I were a glove upon that hand,
-    That I might touch that cheek!
-
-  Jul. Ay me!
-
-  Rom. She speaks.
-    O, speak again, bright angel! for thou art
-    As glorious to this night, being o'er my head,
-    As is a winged messenger of heaven
-    Unto the white-upturned wond'ring eyes
-    Of mortals that fall back to gaze on him
-    When he bestrides the lazy-pacing clouds
-    And sails upon the bosom of the air.
-
-  Jul. O Romeo, Romeo! wherefore art thou Romeo?
-    Deny thy father and refuse thy name!
-    Or, if thou wilt not, be but sworn my love,
-    And I'll no longer be a Capulet.
-
-  Rom. [aside] Shall I hear more, or shall I speak at this?
-
-  Jul. 'Tis but thy name that is my enemy.
-    Thou art thyself, though not a Montague.
-    What's Montague? it is nor hand, nor foot,
-    Nor arm, nor face, nor any other part
-    Belonging to a man. O, be some other name!
-    What's in a name? That which we call a rose
-    By any other name would smell as sweet.
-    So Romeo would, were he not Romeo call'd,
-    Retain that dear perfection which he owes
-    Without that title. Romeo, doff thy name;
-    And for that name, which is no part of thee,
-    Take all myself.
-
-  Rom. I take thee at thy word.
-    Call me but love, and I'll be new baptiz'd;
-    Henceforth I never will be Romeo.
-
-  Jul. What man art thou that, thus bescreen'd in night,
-    So stumblest on my counsel?
-
-  Rom. By a name
-    I know not how to tell thee who I am.
-    My name, dear saint, is hateful to myself,
-    Because it is an enemy to thee.
-    Had I it written, I would tear the word.
-
-  Jul. My ears have yet not drunk a hundred words
-    Of that tongue's utterance, yet I know the sound.
-    Art thou not Romeo, and a Montague?
-
-  Rom. Neither, fair saint, if either thee dislike.
-
-  Jul. How cam'st thou hither, tell me, and wherefore?
-    The orchard walls are high and hard to climb,
-    And the place death, considering who thou art,
-    If any of my kinsmen find thee here.
-
-  Rom. With love's light wings did I o'erperch these walls;
-    For stony limits cannot hold love out,
-    And what love can do, that dares love attempt.
-    Therefore thy kinsmen are no let to me.
-
-  Jul. If they do see thee, they will murther thee.
-
-  Rom. Alack, there lies more peril in thine eye
-    Than twenty of their swords! Look thou but sweet,
-    And I am proof against their enmity.
-
-  Jul. I would not for the world they saw thee here.
-
-  Rom. I have night's cloak to hide me from their sight;
-    And but thou love me, let them find me here.
-    My life were better ended by their hate
-    Than death prorogued, wanting of thy love.
-
-  Jul. By whose direction found'st thou out this place?
-
-  Rom. By love, that first did prompt me to enquire.
-    He lent me counsel, and I lent him eyes.
-    I am no pilot; yet, wert thou as far
-    As that vast shore wash'd with the farthest sea,
-    I would adventure for such merchandise.
-
-  Jul. Thou knowest the mask of night is on my face;
-    Else would a maiden blush bepaint my cheek
-    For that which thou hast heard me speak to-night.
-    Fain would I dwell on form- fain, fain deny
-    What I have spoke; but farewell compliment!
-    Dost thou love me, I know thou wilt say 'Ay';
-    And I will take thy word. Yet, if thou swear'st,
-    Thou mayst prove false. At lovers' perjuries,
-    They say Jove laughs. O gentle Romeo,
-    If thou dost love, pronounce it faithfully.
-    Or if thou thinkest I am too quickly won,
-    I'll frown, and be perverse, and say thee nay,
-    So thou wilt woo; but else, not for the world.
-    In truth, fair Montague, I am too fond,
-    And therefore thou mayst think my haviour light;
-    But trust me, gentleman, I'll prove more true
-    Than those that have more cunning to be strange.
-    I should have been more strange, I must confess,
-    But that thou overheard'st, ere I was ware,
-    My true-love passion. Therefore pardon me,
-    And not impute this yielding to light love,
-    Which the dark night hath so discovered.
-
-  Rom. Lady, by yonder blessed moon I swear,
-    That tips with silver all these fruit-tree tops-
-
-  Jul. O, swear not by the moon, th' inconstant moon,
-    That monthly changes in her circled orb,
-    Lest that thy love prove likewise variable.
-
-  Rom. What shall I swear by?
-
-  Jul. Do not swear at all;
-    Or if thou wilt, swear by thy gracious self,
-    Which is the god of my idolatry,
-    And I'll believe thee.
-
-  Rom. If my heart's dear love-
-
-  Jul. Well, do not swear. Although I joy in thee,
-    I have no joy of this contract to-night.
-    It is too rash, too unadvis'd, too sudden;
-    Too like the lightning, which doth cease to be
-    Ere one can say 'It lightens.' Sweet, good night!
-    This bud of love, by summer's ripening breath,
-    May prove a beauteous flow'r when next we meet.
-    Good night, good night! As sweet repose and rest
-    Come to thy heart as that within my breast!
-
-  Rom. O, wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied?
-
-  Jul. What satisfaction canst thou have to-night?
-
-  Rom. Th' exchange of thy love's faithful vow for mine.
-
-  Jul. I gave thee mine before thou didst request it;
-    And yet I would it were to give again.
-
-  Rom. Would'st thou withdraw it? For what purpose, love?
-
-  Jul. But to be frank and give it thee again.
-    And yet I wish but for the thing I have.
-    My bounty is as boundless as the sea,
-    My love as deep; the more I give to thee,
-    The more I have, for both are infinite.
-    I hear some noise within. Dear love, adieu!
-                                           [Nurse] calls within.
-    Anon, good nurse! Sweet Montague, be true.
-    Stay but a little, I will come again.                [Exit.]
-
-  Rom. O blessed, blessed night! I am afeard,
-    Being in night, all this is but a dream,
-    Too flattering-sweet to be substantial.
-
-                       Enter Juliet above.
-
-
-  Jul. Three words, dear Romeo, and good night indeed.
-    If that thy bent of love be honourable,
-    Thy purpose marriage, send me word to-morrow,
-    By one that I'll procure to come to thee,
-    Where and what time thou wilt perform the rite;
-    And all my fortunes at thy foot I'll lay
-    And follow thee my lord throughout the world.
-
-  Nurse. (within) Madam!
-
-  Jul. I come, anon.- But if thou meanest not well,
-    I do beseech thee-
-
-  Nurse. (within) Madam!
-
-  Jul. By-and-by I come.-
-    To cease thy suit and leave me to my grief.
-    To-morrow will I send.
-
-  Rom. So thrive my soul-
-
-  Jul. A thousand times good night!                        Exit.
-
-  Rom. A thousand times the worse, to want thy light!
-    Love goes toward love as schoolboys from their books;
-    But love from love, towards school with heavy looks.
-
-                     Enter Juliet again, [above].
-
-
-  Jul. Hist! Romeo, hist! O for a falconer's voice
-    To lure this tassel-gentle back again!
-    Bondage is hoarse and may not speak aloud;
-    Else would I tear the cave where Echo lies,
-    And make her airy tongue more hoarse than mine
-    With repetition of my Romeo's name.
-    Romeo!
-
-  Rom. It is my soul that calls upon my name.
-    How silver-sweet sound lovers' tongues by night,
-    Like softest music to attending ears!
-
-  Jul. Romeo!
-
-  Rom. My dear?
-
-  Jul. At what o'clock to-morrow
-    Shall I send to thee?
-
-  Rom. By the hour of nine.
-
-  Jul. I will not fail. 'Tis twenty years till then.
-    I have forgot why I did call thee back.
-
-  Rom. Let me stand here till thou remember it.
-
-  Jul. I shall forget, to have thee still stand there,
-    Rememb'ring how I love thy company.
-
-  Rom. And I'll still stay, to have thee still forget,
-    Forgetting any other home but this.
-
-  Jul. 'Tis almost morning. I would have thee gone-
-    And yet no farther than a wanton's bird,
-    That lets it hop a little from her hand,
-    Like a poor prisoner in his twisted gyves,
-    And with a silk thread plucks it back again,
-    So loving-jealous of his liberty.
-
-  Rom. I would I were thy bird.
-
-  Jul. Sweet, so would I.
-    Yet I should kill thee with much cherishing.
-    Good night, good night! Parting is such sweet sorrow,
-    That I shall say good night till it be morrow.
-                                                         [Exit.]
-
-  Rom. Sleep dwell upon thine eyes, peace in thy breast!
-    Would I were sleep and peace, so sweet to rest!
-    Hence will I to my ghostly father's cell,
-    His help to crave and my dear hap to tell.
- Exit
-
-
-
-
-Scene III.
-Friar Laurence's cell.
-
-Enter Friar, [Laurence] alone, with a basket.
-
-
-  Friar. The grey-ey'd morn smiles on the frowning night,
-    Check'ring the Eastern clouds with streaks of light;
-    And flecked darkness like a drunkard reels
-    From forth day's path and Titan's fiery wheels.
-    Non, ere the sun advance his burning eye
-    The day to cheer and night's dank dew to dry,
-    I must up-fill this osier cage of ours
-    With baleful weeds and precious-juiced flowers.
-    The earth that's nature's mother is her tomb.
-    What is her burying gave, that is her womb;
-    And from her womb children of divers kind
-    We sucking on her natural bosom find;
-    Many for many virtues excellent,
-    None but for some, and yet all different.
-    O, mickle is the powerful grace that lies
-    In plants, herbs, stones, and their true qualities;
-    For naught so vile that on the earth doth live
-    But to the earth some special good doth give;
-    Nor aught so good but, strain'd from that fair use,
-    Revolts from true birth, stumbling on abuse.
-    Virtue itself turns vice, being misapplied,
-    And vice sometime's by action dignified.
-    Within the infant rind of this small flower
-    Poison hath residence, and medicine power;
-    For this, being smelt, with that part cheers each part;
-    Being tasted, slays all senses with the heart.
-    Two such opposed kings encamp them still
-    In man as well as herbs- grace and rude will;
-    And where the worser is predominant,
-    Full soon the canker death eats up that plant.
-
-                        Enter Romeo.
-
-
-  Rom. Good morrow, father.
-
-  Friar. Benedicite!
-    What early tongue so sweet saluteth me?
-    Young son, it argues a distempered head
-    So soon to bid good morrow to thy bed.
-    Care keeps his watch in every old man's eye,
-    And where care lodges sleep will never lie;
-    But where unbruised youth with unstuff'd brain
-    Doth couch his limbs, there golden sleep doth reign.
-    Therefore thy earliness doth me assure
-    Thou art uprous'd with some distemp'rature;
-    Or if not so, then here I hit it right-
-    Our Romeo hath not been in bed to-night.
-
-  Rom. That last is true-the sweeter rest was mine.
-
-  Friar. God pardon sin! Wast thou with Rosaline?
-
-  Rom. With Rosaline, my ghostly father? No.
-    I have forgot that name, and that name's woe.
-
-  Friar. That's my good son! But where hast thou been then?
-
-  Rom. I'll tell thee ere thou ask it me again.
-    I have been feasting with mine enemy,
-    Where on a sudden one hath wounded me
-    That's by me wounded. Both our remedies
-    Within thy help and holy physic lies.
-    I bear no hatred, blessed man, for, lo,
-    My intercession likewise steads my foe.
-
-  Friar. Be plain, good son, and homely in thy drift
-    Riddling confession finds but riddling shrift.
-
-  Rom. Then plainly know my heart's dear love is set
-    On the fair daughter of rich Capulet;
-    As mine on hers, so hers is set on mine,
-    And all combin'd, save what thou must combine
-    By holy marriage. When, and where, and how
-    We met, we woo'd, and made exchange of vow,
-    I'll tell thee as we pass; but this I pray,
-    That thou consent to marry us to-day.
-
-  Friar. Holy Saint Francis! What a change is here!
-    Is Rosaline, that thou didst love so dear,
-    So soon forsaken? Young men's love then lies
-    Not truly in their hearts, but in their eyes.
-    Jesu Maria! What a deal of brine
-    Hath wash'd thy sallow cheeks for Rosaline!
-    How much salt water thrown away in waste,
-    To season love, that of it doth not taste!
-    The sun not yet thy sighs from heaven clears,
-    Thy old groans ring yet in mine ancient ears.
-    Lo, here upon thy cheek the stain doth sit
-    Of an old tear that is not wash'd off yet.
-    If e'er thou wast thyself, and these woes thine,
-    Thou and these woes were all for Rosaline.
-    And art thou chang'd? Pronounce this sentence then:
-    Women may fall when there's no strength in men.
-
-  Rom. Thou chid'st me oft for loving Rosaline.
-
-  Friar. For doting, not for loving, pupil mine.
-
-  Rom. And bad'st me bury love.
-
-  Friar. Not in a grave
-    To lay one in, another out to have.
-
-  Rom. I pray thee chide not. She whom I love now
-    Doth grace for grace and love for love allow.
-    The other did not so.
-
-  Friar. O, she knew well
-    Thy love did read by rote, that could not spell.
-    But come, young waverer, come go with me.
-    In one respect I'll thy assistant be;
-    For this alliance may so happy prove
-    To turn your households' rancour to pure love.
-
-  Rom. O, let us hence! I stand on sudden haste.
-
-  Friar. Wisely, and slow. They stumble that run fast.
-                                                         Exeunt.
-
-
-
-
-Scene IV.
-A street.
-
-Enter Benvolio and Mercutio.
-
-
-  Mer. Where the devil should this Romeo be?
-    Came he not home to-night?
-
-  Ben. Not to his father's. I spoke with his man.
-
-  Mer. Why, that same pale hard-hearted wench, that Rosaline,
-    Torments him so that he will sure run mad.
-
-  Ben. Tybalt, the kinsman to old Capulet,
-    Hath sent a letter to his father's house.
-
-  Mer. A challenge, on my life.
-
-  Ben. Romeo will answer it.
-
-  Mer. Any man that can write may answer a letter.
-
-  Ben. Nay, he will answer the letter's master, how he dares,
-    being dared.
-
-  Mer. Alas, poor Romeo, he is already dead! stabb'd with a white
-    wench's black eye; shot through the ear with a love song; the
-    very pin of his heart cleft with the blind bow-boy's
-    butt-shaft; and is he a man to encounter Tybalt?
-
-  Ben. Why, what is Tybalt?
-
-  Mer. More than Prince of Cats, I can tell you. O, he's the
-    courageous captain of compliments. He fights as you sing
-    pricksong-keeps time, distance, and proportion; rests me his
-    minim rest, one, two, and the third in your bosom! the very
-    butcher of a silk button, a duellist, a duellist! a gentleman
-    of the very first house, of the first and second cause. Ah, the
-    immortal passado! the punto reverse! the hay.
-
-  Ben. The what?
-
-  Mer. The pox of such antic, lisping, affecting fantasticoes-
-    these new tuners of accent! 'By Jesu, a very good blade! a very
-    tall man! a very good whore!' Why, is not this a lamentable thing,
-    grandsir, that we should be thus afflicted with these strange
-    flies, these fashion-mongers, these pardona-mi's, who stand
-    so much on the new form that they cannot sit at ease on the old
-    bench? O, their bones, their bones!
-
-                               Enter Romeo.
-
-
-  Ben. Here comes Romeo! here comes Romeo!
-
-  Mer. Without his roe, like a dried herring. O flesh, flesh, how
-    art thou fishified! Now is he for the numbers that Petrarch
-    flowed in. Laura, to his lady, was but a kitchen wench (marry, she
-    had a better love to berhyme her), Dido a dowdy, Cleopatra a gypsy,
-    Helen and Hero hildings and harlots, This be a gray eye or so,
-    but not to the purpose. Signior Romeo, bon jour! There's a French
-    salutation to your French slop. You gave us the counterfeit
-    fairly last night.
-
-  Rom. Good morrow to you both. What counterfeit did I give you?
-
-  Mer. The slip, sir, the slip. Can you not conceive?
-
-  Rom. Pardon, good Mercutio. My business was great, and in such a
-    case as mine a man may strain courtesy.
-
-  Mer. That's as much as to say, such a case as yours constrains a
-    man to bow in the hams.
-
-  Rom. Meaning, to cursy.
-
-  Mer. Thou hast most kindly hit it.
-
-  Rom. A most courteous exposition.
-
-  Mer. Nay, I am the very pink of courtesy.
-
-  Rom. Pink for flower.
-
-  Mer. Right.
-
-  Rom. Why, then is my pump well-flower'd.
-
-  Mer. Well said! Follow me this jest now till thou hast worn out
-    thy pump, that, when the single sole of it is worn, the jest may
-    remain, after the wearing, solely singular.
-
-  Rom. O single-sold jest, solely singular for the singleness!
-
-  Mer. Come between us, good Benvolio! My wits faint.
-
-  Rom. Swits and spurs, swits and spurs! or I'll cry a match.
-
-  Mer. Nay, if our wits run the wild-goose chase, I am done; for
-    thou hast more of the wild goose in one of thy wits than, I am
-    sure, I have in my whole five. Was I with you there for the goose?
-
-  Rom. Thou wast never with me for anything when thou wast not
-    there for the goose.
-
-  Mer. I will bite thee by the ear for that jest.
-
-  Rom. Nay, good goose, bite not!
-
-  Mer. Thy wit is a very bitter sweeting; it is a most sharp sauce.
-
-  Rom. And is it not, then, well serv'd in to a sweet goose?
-
-  Mer. O, here's a wit of cheveril, that stretches from an inch
-    narrow to an ell broad!
-
-  Rom. I stretch it out for that word 'broad,' which, added to
-    the goose, proves thee far and wide a broad goose.
-
-  Mer. Why, is not this better now than groaning for love? Now
-    art thou sociable, now art thou Romeo; now art thou what thou art, by
-    art as well as by nature. For this drivelling love is like a
-    great natural that runs lolling up and down to hide his bauble in
-    a hole.
-
-  Ben. Stop there, stop there!
-
-  Mer. Thou desirest me to stop in my tale against the hair.
-
-  Ben. Thou wouldst else have made thy tale large.
-
-  Mer. O, thou art deceiv'd! I would have made it short; for I
-    was come to the whole depth of my tale, and meant indeed to
-    occupy the argument no longer.
-
-  Rom. Here's goodly gear!
-
-                      Enter Nurse and her Man [Peter].
-
-
-  Mer. A sail, a sail!
-
-  Ben. Two, two! a shirt and a smock.
-
-  Nurse. Peter!
-
-  Peter. Anon.
-
-  Nurse. My fan, Peter.
-
-  Mer. Good Peter, to hide her face; for her fan's the fairer face of
-    the two.
-
-  Nurse. God ye good morrow, gentlemen.
-
-  Mer. God ye good-den, fair gentlewoman.
-
-  Nurse. Is it good-den?
-
-  Mer. 'Tis no less, I tell ye; for the bawdy hand of the dial is
-    now upon the prick of noon.
-
-  Nurse. Out upon you! What a man are you!
-
-  Rom. One, gentlewoman, that God hath made for himself to mar.
-
-  Nurse. By my troth, it is well said. 'For himself to mar,'
-    quoth 'a? Gentlemen, can any of you tell me where I may find the
-    young Romeo?
-
-  Rom. I can tell you; but young Romeo will be older when you
-    have found him than he was when you sought him. I am the youngest
-    of that name, for fault of a worse.
-
-  Nurse. You say well.
-
-  Mer. Yea, is the worst well? Very well took, i' faith! wisely,
-    wisely.
-
-  Nurse. If you be he, sir, I desire some confidence with you.
-
-  Ben. She will endite him to some supper.
-
-  Mer. A bawd, a bawd, a bawd! So ho!
-
-  Rom. What hast thou found?
-
-  Mer. No hare, sir; unless a hare, sir, in a lenten pie, that is
-    something stale and hoar ere it be spent
-                                     He walks by them and sings.
-
-                   An old hare hoar,
-                   And an old hare hoar,
-                Is very good meat in Lent;
-                   But a hare that is hoar
-                   Is too much for a score
-                When it hoars ere it be spent.
-
-    Romeo, will you come to your father's? We'll to dinner thither.
-
-  Rom. I will follow you.
-
-  Mer. Farewell, ancient lady. Farewell,
-    [sings] lady, lady, lady.
-                                      Exeunt Mercutio, Benvolio.
-
-  Nurse. Marry, farewell! I Pray you, Sir, what saucy merchant
-    was this that was so full of his ropery?
-
-  Rom. A gentleman, nurse, that loves to hear himself talk and
-    will speak more in a minute than he will stand to in a month.
-
-  Nurse. An 'a speak anything against me, I'll take him down, an
-'a
-    were lustier than he is, and twenty such jacks; and if I cannot,
-    I'll find those that shall. Scurvy knave! I am none of his
-    flirt-gills; I am none of his skains-mates. And thou must
-    stand by too, and suffer every knave to use me at his pleasure!
-
-  Peter. I saw no man use you at his pleasure. If I had, my
-    weapon should quickly have been out, I warrant you. I dare draw as
-    soon as another man, if I see occasion in a good quarrel, and the
-    law on my side.
-
-  Nurse. Now, afore God, I am so vexed that every part about me
-    quivers. Scurvy knave! Pray you, sir, a word; and, as I told you,
-    my young lady bid me enquire you out. What she bid me say, I
-    will keep to myself; but first let me tell ye, if ye should lead
-    her into a fool's paradise, as they say, it were a very gross kind of
-    behaviour, as they say; for the gentlewoman is young; and
-    therefore, if you should deal double with her, truly it were
-    an ill thing to be off'red to any gentlewoman, and very weak dealing.
-
-  Rom. Nurse, commend me to thy lady and mistress. I protest unto
-    thee-
-
-  Nurse. Good heart, and I faith I will tell her as much. Lord,
-    Lord! she will be a joyful woman.
-
-  Rom. What wilt thou tell her, nurse? Thou dost not mark me.
-
-  Nurse. I will tell her, sir, that you do protest, which, as I
-    take it, is a gentlemanlike offer.
-
-  Rom. Bid her devise
-    Some means to come to shrift this afternoon;
-    And there she shall at Friar Laurence' cell
-    Be shriv'd and married. Here is for thy pains.
-
-  Nurse. No, truly, sir; not a penny.
-
-  Rom. Go to! I say you shall.
-
-  Nurse. This afternoon, sir? Well, she shall be there.
-
-  Rom. And stay, good nurse, behind the abbey wall.
-    Within this hour my man shall be with thee
-    And bring thee cords made like a tackled stair,
-    Which to the high topgallant of my joy
-    Must be my convoy in the secret night.
-    Farewell. Be trusty, and I'll quit thy pains.
-    Farewell. Commend me to thy mistress.
-
-  Nurse. Now God in heaven bless thee! Hark you, sir.
-
-  Rom. What say'st thou, my dear nurse?
-
-  Nurse. Is your man secret? Did you ne'er hear say,
-    Two may keep counsel, putting one away?
-
-  Rom. I warrant thee my man's as true as steel.
-
-  Nurse. Well, sir, my mistress is the sweetest lady. Lord, Lord!
-    when 'twas a little prating thing- O, there is a nobleman in
-    town, one Paris, that would fain lay knife aboard; but she,
-    good soul, had as lieve see a toad, a very toad, as see him. I
-    anger her sometimes, and tell her that Paris is the properer man;
-    but I'll warrant you, when I say so, she looks as pale as any
-    clout in the versal world. Doth not rosemary and Romeo begin both
-    with a letter?
-
-  Rom. Ay, nurse; what of that? Both with an R.
-
-  Nurse. Ah, mocker! that's the dog's name. R is for the- No; I
-    know it begins with some other letter; and she hath the prettiest
-    sententious of it, of you and rosemary, that it would do you
-    good to hear it.
-
-  Rom. Commend me to thy lady.
-
-  Nurse. Ay, a thousand times. [Exit Romeo.] Peter!
-
-  Peter. Anon.
-
-  Nurse. Peter, take my fan, and go before, and apace.
-                                                         Exeunt.

-Scene V.
-Capulet's orchard.
-
-Enter Juliet.
-
-
-  Jul. The clock struck nine when I did send the nurse;
-    In half an hour she 'promis'd to return.
-    Perchance she cannot meet him. That's not so.
-    O, she is lame! Love's heralds should be thoughts,
-    Which ten times faster glide than the sun's beams
-    Driving back shadows over low'ring hills.
-    Therefore do nimble-pinion'd doves draw Love,
-    And therefore hath the wind-swift Cupid wings.
-    Now is the sun upon the highmost hill
-    Of this day's journey, and from nine till twelve
-    Is three long hours; yet she is not come.
-    Had she affections and warm youthful blood,
-    She would be as swift in motion as a ball;
-    My words would bandy her to my sweet love,
-    And his to me,
-    But old folks, many feign as they were dead-
-    Unwieldy, slow, heavy and pale as lead.
-
-                      Enter Nurse [and Peter].
-
-    O God, she comes! O honey nurse, what news?
-    Hast thou met with him? Send thy man away.
-
-  Nurse. Peter, stay at the gate.
-                                                   [Exit Peter.]
-
-  Jul. Now, good sweet nurse- O Lord, why look'st thou sad?
-    Though news be sad, yet tell them merrily;
-    If good, thou shamest the music of sweet news
-    By playing it to me with so sour a face.
-
-  Nurse. I am aweary, give me leave awhile.
-    Fie, how my bones ache! What a jaunce have I had!
-
-  Jul. I would thou hadst my bones, and I thy news.
-    Nay, come, I pray thee speak. Good, good nurse, speak.
-
-  Nurse. Jesu, what haste! Can you not stay awhile?
-    Do you not see that I am out of breath?
-
-  Jul. How art thou out of breath when thou hast breath
-    To say to me that thou art out of breath?
-    The excuse that thou dost make in this delay
-    Is longer than the tale thou dost excuse.
-    Is thy news good or bad? Answer to that.
-    Say either, and I'll stay the circumstance.
-    Let me be satisfied, is't good or bad?
-
-  Nurse. Well, you have made a simple choice; you know not how to
-    choose a man. Romeo? No, not he. Though his face be better
-    than any man's, yet his leg excels all men's; and for a hand and a
-    foot, and a body, though they be not to be talk'd on, yet
-    they are past compare. He is not the flower of courtesy, but, I'll
-    warrant him, as gentle as a lamb. Go thy ways, wench; serve
-God.
-    What, have you din'd at home?
-
-  Jul. No, no. But all this did I know before.
-    What says he of our marriage? What of that?
-
-  Nurse. Lord, how my head aches! What a head have I!
-    It beats as it would fall in twenty pieces.
-    My back o' t' other side,- ah, my back, my back!
-    Beshrew your heart for sending me about
-    To catch my death with jauncing up and down!
-
-  Jul. I' faith, I am sorry that thou art not well.
-    Sweet, sweet, Sweet nurse, tell me, what says my love?
-
-  Nurse. Your love says, like an honest gentleman, and a courteous,
-    and a kind, and a handsome; and, I warrant, a virtuous- Where
-    is your mother?
-
-  Jul. Where is my mother? Why, she is within.
-    Where should she be? How oddly thou repliest!
-    'Your love says, like an honest gentleman,
-    "Where is your mother?"'
-
-  Nurse. O God's Lady dear!
-    Are you so hot? Marry come up, I trow.
-    Is this the poultice for my aching bones?
-    Henceforward do your messages yourself.
-
-  Jul. Here's such a coil! Come, what says Romeo?
-
-  Nurse. Have you got leave to go to shrift to-day?
-
-  Jul. I have.
-
-  Nurse. Then hie you hence to Friar Laurence' cell;
-    There stays a husband to make you a wife.
-    Now comes the wanton blood up in your cheeks:
-    They'll be in scarlet straight at any news.
-    Hie you to church; I must another way,
-    To fetch a ladder, by the which your love
-    Must climb a bird's nest soon when it is dark.
-    I am the drudge, and toil in your delight;
-    But you shall bear the burthen soon at night.
-    Go; I'll to dinner; hie you to the cell.
-
-  Jul. Hie to high fortune! Honest nurse, farewell.
-                                                         Exeunt.
-
-
-
-
-Scene VI.
-Friar Laurence's cell.
-
-Enter Friar [Laurence] and Romeo.
-
-
-  Friar. So smile the heavens upon this holy act
-    That after-hours with sorrow chide us not!
-
-  Rom. Amen, amen! But come what sorrow can,
-    It cannot countervail the exchange of joy
-    That one short minute gives me in her sight.
-    Do thou but close our hands with holy words,
-    Then love-devouring death do what he dare-
-    It is enough I may but call her mine.
-
-  Friar. These violent delights have violent ends
-    And in their triumph die, like fire and powder,
-    Which, as they kiss, consume. The sweetest honey
-    Is loathsome in his own deliciousness
-    And in the taste confounds the appetite.
-    Therefore love moderately: long love doth so;
-    Too swift arrives as tardy as too slow.
-
-                     Enter Juliet.
-
-    Here comes the lady. O, so light a foot
-    Will ne'er wear out the everlasting flint.
-    A lover may bestride the gossamer
-    That idles in the wanton summer air,
-    And yet not fall; so light is vanity.
-
-  Jul. Good even to my ghostly confessor.
-
-  Friar. Romeo shall thank thee, daughter, for us both.
-
-  Jul. As much to him, else is his thanks too much.
-
-  Rom. Ah, Juliet, if the measure of thy joy
-    Be heap'd like mine, and that thy skill be more
-    To blazon it, then sweeten with thy breath
-    This neighbour air, and let rich music's tongue
-    Unfold the imagin'd happiness that both
-    Receive in either by this dear encounter.
-
-  Jul. Conceit, more rich in matter than in words,
-    Brags of his substance, not of ornament.
-    They are but beggars that can count their worth;
-    But my true love is grown to such excess
-    cannot sum up sum of half my wealth.
-
-  Friar. Come, come with me, and we will make short work;
-    For, by your leaves, you shall not stay alone
-    Till Holy Church incorporate two in one.
-                                                       [Exeunt.]

-
-
-ACT III. Scene I.
-A public place.
-
-Enter Mercutio, Benvolio, and Men.
-
-
-  Ben. I pray thee, good Mercutio, let's retire.
-    The day is hot, the Capulets abroad.
-    And if we meet, we shall not scape a brawl,
-    For now, these hot days, is the mad blood stirring.
-
-  Mer. Thou art like one of these fellows that, when he enters
-    the confines of a tavern, claps me his sword upon the table and
-    says 'God send me no need of thee!' and by the operation of the
-    second cup draws him on the drawer, when indeed there is no need.
-
-  Ben. Am I like such a fellow?
-
-  Mer. Come, come, thou art as hot a jack in thy mood as any in
-    Italy; and as soon moved to be moody, and as soon moody to be
-    moved.
-
-  Ben. And what to?
-
-  Mer. Nay, an there were two such, we should have none shortly,
-    for one would kill the other. Thou! why, thou wilt quarrel with a
-    man that hath a hair more or a hair less in his beard than thou hast.
-    Thou wilt quarrel with a man for cracking nuts, having no
-    other reason but because thou hast hazel eyes. What eye but such an
-    eye would spy out such a quarrel? Thy head is as full of quarrels
-    as an egg is full of meat; and yet thy head hath been beaten as
-    addle as an egg for quarrelling. Thou hast quarrell'd with a
-    man for coughing in the street, because he hath wakened thy dog
-    that hath lain asleep in the sun. Didst thou not fall out with a
-    tailor for wearing his new doublet before Easter, with
-    another for tying his new shoes with an old riband? And yet thou wilt
-    tutor me from quarrelling!
-
-  Ben. An I were so apt to quarrel as thou art, any man should
-    buy the fee simple of my life for an hour and a quarter.
-
-  Mer. The fee simple? O simple!
-
-                       Enter Tybalt and others.
-
-
-  Ben. By my head, here come the Capulets.
-
-  Mer. By my heel, I care not.
-
-  Tyb. Follow me close, for I will speak to them.
-    Gentlemen, good den. A word with one of you.
-
-  Mer. And but one word with one of us?
-    Couple it with something; make it a word and a blow.
-
-  Tyb. You shall find me apt enough to that, sir, an you will give me
-    occasion.
-
-  Mer. Could you not take some occasion without giving
-
-  Tyb. Mercutio, thou consortest with Romeo.
-
-  Mer. Consort? What, dost thou make us minstrels? An thou make
-    minstrels of us, look to hear nothing but discords. Here's my
-    fiddlestick; here's that shall make you dance. Zounds, consort!
-
-  Ben. We talk here in the public haunt of men.
-    Either withdraw unto some private place
-    And reason coldly of your grievances,
-    Or else depart. Here all eyes gaze on us.
-
-  Mer. Men's eyes were made to look, and let them gaze.
-    I will not budge for no man's pleasure,
-
-                        Enter Romeo.
-
-
-  Tyb. Well, peace be with you, sir. Here comes my man.
-
-  Mer. But I'll be hang'd, sir, if he wear your livery.
-    Marry, go before to field, he'll be your follower!
-    Your worship in that sense may call him man.
-
-  Tyb. Romeo, the love I bear thee can afford
-    No better term than this: thou art a villain.
-
-  Rom. Tybalt, the reason that I have to love thee
-    Doth much excuse the appertaining rage
-    To such a greeting. Villain am I none.
-    Therefore farewell. I see thou knowest me not.
-
-  Tyb. Boy, this shall not excuse the injuries
-    That thou hast done me; therefore turn and draw.
-
-  Rom. I do protest I never injur'd thee,
-    But love thee better than thou canst devise
-    Till thou shalt know the reason of my love;
-    And so good Capulet, which name I tender
-    As dearly as mine own, be satisfied.
-
-  Mer. O calm, dishonourable, vile submission!
-    Alla stoccata carries it away.                      [Draws.]
-    Tybalt, you ratcatcher, will you walk?
-
-  Tyb. What wouldst thou have with me?
-
-  Mer. Good King of Cats, nothing but one of your nine lives.
-That I
-    mean to make bold withal, and, as you shall use me hereafter,
-
-    dry-beat the rest of the eight. Will you pluck your sword out
-    of his pitcher by the ears? Make haste, lest mine be about your
-    ears ere it be out.
-
-  Tyb. I am for you.                                    [Draws.]
-
-  Rom. Gentle Mercutio, put thy rapier up.
-
-  Mer. Come, sir, your passado!
-                                                   [They fight.]
-
-  Rom. Draw, Benvolio; beat down their weapons.
-    Gentlemen, for shame! forbear this outrage!
-    Tybalt, Mercutio, the Prince expressly hath
-    Forbid this bandying in Verona streets.
-    Hold, Tybalt! Good Mercutio!
-         Tybalt under Romeo's arm thrusts Mercutio in, and flies
-                                           [with his Followers].
-
-  Mer. I am hurt.
-    A plague o' both your houses! I am sped.
-    Is he gone and hath nothing?
-
-  Ben. What, art thou hurt?
-
-  Mer. Ay, ay, a scratch, a scratch. Marry, 'tis enough.
-    Where is my page? Go, villain, fetch a surgeon.
-                                                    [Exit Page.]
-
-  Rom. Courage, man. The hurt cannot be much.
-
-  Mer. No, 'tis not so deep as a well, nor so wide as a church door;
-    but 'tis enough, 'twill serve. Ask for me to-morrow, and you
-    shall find me a grave man. I am peppered, I warrant, for this
-    world. A plague o' both your houses! Zounds, a dog, a rat, a
-    mouse, a cat, to scratch a man to death! a braggart, a rogue,
-a
-    villain, that fights by the book of arithmetic! Why the devil
-    came you between us? I was hurt under your arm.
-
-  Rom. I thought all for the best.
-
-  Mer. Help me into some house, Benvolio,
-    Or I shall faint. A plague o' both your houses!
-    They have made worms' meat of me. I have it,
-    And soundly too. Your houses!
-                                 [Exit. [supported by Benvolio].
-
-  Rom. This gentleman, the Prince's near ally,
-    My very friend, hath got this mortal hurt
-    In my behalf- my reputation stain'd
-    With Tybalt's slander- Tybalt, that an hour
-    Hath been my kinsman. O sweet Juliet,
-    Thy beauty hath made me effeminate
-    And in my temper soft'ned valour's steel
-
-                      Enter Benvolio.
-
-
-  Ben. O Romeo, Romeo, brave Mercutio's dead!
-    That gallant spirit hath aspir'd the clouds,
-    Which too untimely here did scorn the earth.
-
-  Rom. This day's black fate on moe days doth depend;
-    This but begins the woe others must end.
-
-                       Enter Tybalt.
-
-
-  Ben. Here comes the furious Tybalt back again.
-
-  Rom. Alive in triumph, and Mercutio slain?
-    Away to heaven respective lenity,
-    And fire-ey'd fury be my conduct now!
-    Now, Tybalt, take the 'villain' back again
-    That late thou gavest me; for Mercutio's soul
-    Is but a little way above our heads,
-    Staying for thine to keep him company.
-    Either thou or I, or both, must go with him.
-
-  Tyb. Thou, wretched boy, that didst consort him here,
-    Shalt with him hence.
-
-  Rom. This shall determine that.
-                                       They fight. Tybalt falls.
-
-  Ben. Romeo, away, be gone!
-    The citizens are up, and Tybalt slain.
-    Stand not amaz'd. The Prince will doom thee death
-    If thou art taken. Hence, be gone, away!
-
-  Rom. O, I am fortune's fool!
-
-  Ben. Why dost thou stay?
-                                                     Exit Romeo.
-                      Enter Citizens.
-
-
-  Citizen. Which way ran he that kill'd Mercutio?
-    Tybalt, that murtherer, which way ran he?
-
-  Ben. There lies that Tybalt.
-
-  Citizen. Up, sir, go with me.
-    I charge thee in the Prince's name obey.
-
-
-  Enter Prince [attended], Old Montague, Capulet, their Wives,
-                     and [others].
-
-
-  Prince. Where are the vile beginners of this fray?
-
-  Ben. O noble Prince. I can discover all
-    The unlucky manage of this fatal brawl.
-    There lies the man, slain by young Romeo,
-    That slew thy kinsman, brave Mercutio.
-
-  Cap. Wife. Tybalt, my cousin! O my brother's child!
-    O Prince! O husband! O, the blood is spill'd
-    Of my dear kinsman! Prince, as thou art true,
-    For blood of ours shed blood of Montague.
-    O cousin, cousin!
-
-  Prince. Benvolio, who began this bloody fray?
-
-  Ben. Tybalt, here slain, whom Romeo's hand did stay.
-    Romeo, that spoke him fair, bid him bethink
-    How nice the quarrel was, and urg'd withal
-    Your high displeasure. All this- uttered
-    With gentle breath, calm look, knees humbly bow'd-
-    Could not take truce with the unruly spleen
-    Of Tybalt deaf to peace, but that he tilts
-    With piercing steel at bold Mercutio's breast;
-    Who, all as hot, turns deadly point to point,
-    And, with a martial scorn, with one hand beats
-    Cold death aside and with the other sends
-    It back to Tybalt, whose dexterity
-    Retorts it. Romeo he cries aloud,
-    'Hold, friends! friends, part!' and swifter than his tongue,
-    His agile arm beats down their fatal points,
-    And 'twixt them rushes; underneath whose arm
-    An envious thrust from Tybalt hit the life
-    Of stout Mercutio, and then Tybalt fled;
-    But by-and-by comes back to Romeo,
-    Who had but newly entertain'd revenge,
-    And to't they go like lightning; for, ere I
-    Could draw to part them, was stout Tybalt slain;
-    And, as he fell, did Romeo turn and fly.
-    This is the truth, or let Benvolio die.
-
-  Cap. Wife. He is a kinsman to the Montague;
-    Affection makes him false, he speaks not true.
-    Some twenty of them fought in this black strife,
-    And all those twenty could but kill one life.
-    I beg for justice, which thou, Prince, must give.
-    Romeo slew Tybalt; Romeo must not live.
-
-  Prince. Romeo slew him; he slew Mercutio.
-    Who now the price of his dear blood doth owe?
-
-  Mon. Not Romeo, Prince; he was Mercutio's friend;
-    His fault concludes but what the law should end,
-    The life of Tybalt.
-
-  Prince. And for that offence
-    Immediately we do exile him hence.
-    I have an interest in your hate's proceeding,
-    My blood for your rude brawls doth lie a-bleeding;
-    But I'll amerce you with so strong a fine
-    That you shall all repent the loss of mine.
-    I will be deaf to pleading and excuses;
-    Nor tears nor prayers shall purchase out abuses.
-    Therefore use none. Let Romeo hence in haste,
-    Else, when he is found, that hour is his last.
-    Bear hence this body, and attend our will.
-    Mercy but murders, pardoning those that kill.
-                                                         Exeunt.

-Scene II.
-Capulet's orchard.
-
-Enter Juliet alone.
-
-
-  Jul. Gallop apace, you fiery-footed steeds,
-    Towards Phoebus' lodging! Such a wagoner
-    As Phaeton would whip you to the West
-    And bring in cloudy night immediately.
-    Spread thy close curtain, love-performing night,
-    That runaway eyes may wink, and Romeo
-    Leap to these arms untalk'd of and unseen.
-    Lovers can see to do their amorous rites
-    By their own beauties; or, if love be blind,
-    It best agrees with night. Come, civil night,
-    Thou sober-suited matron, all in black,
-    And learn me how to lose a winning match,
-    Play'd for a pair of stainless maidenhoods.
-    Hood my unmann'd blood, bating in my cheeks,
-    With thy black mantle till strange love, grown bold,
-    Think true love acted simple modesty.
-    Come, night; come, Romeo; come, thou day in night;
-    For thou wilt lie upon the wings of night
-    Whiter than new snow upon a raven's back.
-    Come, gentle night; come, loving, black-brow'd night;
-    Give me my Romeo; and, when he shall die,
-    Take him and cut him out in little stars,
-    And he will make the face of heaven so fine
-    That all the world will be in love with night
-    And pay no worship to the garish sun.
-    O, I have bought the mansion of a love,
-    But not possess'd it; and though I am sold,
-    Not yet enjoy'd. So tedious is this day
-    As is the night before some festival
-    To an impatient child that hath new robes
-    And may not wear them. O, here comes my nurse,
-
-                Enter Nurse, with cords.
-
-    And she brings news; and every tongue that speaks
-    But Romeo's name speaks heavenly eloquence.
-    Now, nurse, what news? What hast thou there? the cords
-    That Romeo bid thee fetch?
-
-  Nurse. Ay, ay, the cords.
-                                             [Throws them down.]
-
-  Jul. Ay me! what news? Why dost thou wring thy hands
-
-  Nurse. Ah, weraday! he's dead, he's dead, he's dead!
-    We are undone, lady, we are undone!
-    Alack the day! he's gone, he's kill'd, he's dead!
-
-  Jul. Can heaven be so envious?
-
-  Nurse. Romeo can,
-    Though heaven cannot. O Romeo, Romeo!
-    Who ever would have thought it? Romeo!
-
-  Jul. What devil art thou that dost torment me thus?
-    This torture should be roar'd in dismal hell.
-    Hath Romeo slain himself? Say thou but 'I,'
-    And that bare vowel 'I' shall poison more
-    Than the death-darting eye of cockatrice.
-    I am not I, if there be such an 'I';
-    Or those eyes shut that make thee answer 'I.'
-    If be be slain, say 'I'; or if not, 'no.'
-    Brief sounds determine of my weal or woe.
-
-  Nurse. I saw the wound, I saw it with mine eyes,
-    (God save the mark!) here on his manly breast.
-    A piteous corse, a bloody piteous corse;
-    Pale, pale as ashes, all bedaub'd in blood,
-    All in gore-blood. I swounded at the sight.
-
-  Jul. O, break, my heart! poor bankrout, break at once!
-    To prison, eyes; ne'er look on liberty!
-    Vile earth, to earth resign; end motion here,
-    And thou and Romeo press one heavy bier!
-
-  Nurse. O Tybalt, Tybalt, the best friend I had!
-    O courteous Tybalt! honest gentleman
-    That ever I should live to see thee dead!
-
-  Jul. What storm is this that blows so contrary?
-    Is Romeo slaught'red, and is Tybalt dead?
-    My dear-lov'd cousin, and my dearer lord?
-    Then, dreadful trumpet, sound the general doom!
-    For who is living, if those two are gone?
-
-  Nurse. Tybalt is gone, and Romeo banished;
-    Romeo that kill'd him, he is banished.
-
-  Jul. O God! Did Romeo's hand shed Tybalt's blood?
-
-  Nurse. It did, it did! alas the day, it did!
-
-  Jul. O serpent heart, hid with a flow'ring face!
-    Did ever dragon keep so fair a cave?
-    Beautiful tyrant! fiend angelical!
-    Dove-feather'd raven! wolvish-ravening lamb!
-    Despised substance of divinest show!
-    Just opposite to what thou justly seem'st-
-    A damned saint, an honourable villain!
-    O nature, what hadst thou to do in hell
-    When thou didst bower the spirit of a fiend
-    In mortal paradise of such sweet flesh?
-    Was ever book containing such vile matter
-    So fairly bound? O, that deceit should dwell
-    In such a gorgeous palace!
-
-  Nurse. There's no trust,
-    No faith, no honesty in men; all perjur'd,
-    All forsworn, all naught, all dissemblers.
-    Ah, where's my man? Give me some aqua vitae.
-    These griefs, these woes, these sorrows make me old.
-    Shame come to Romeo!
-
-  Jul. Blister'd be thy tongue
-    For such a wish! He was not born to shame.
-    Upon his brow shame is asham'd to sit;
-    For 'tis a throne where honour may be crown'd
-    Sole monarch of the universal earth.
-    O, what a beast was I to chide at him!
-
-  Nurse. Will you speak well of him that kill'd your cousin?
-
-  Jul. Shall I speak ill of him that is my husband?
-    Ah, poor my lord, what tongue shall smooth thy name
-    When I, thy three-hours wife, have mangled it?
-    But wherefore, villain, didst thou kill my cousin?
-    That villain cousin would have kill'd my husband.
-    Back, foolish tears, back to your native spring!
-    Your tributary drops belong to woe,
-    Which you, mistaking, offer up to joy.
-    My husband lives, that Tybalt would have slain;
-    And Tybalt's dead, that would have slain my husband.
-    All this is comfort; wherefore weep I then?
-    Some word there was, worser than Tybalt's death,
-    That murd'red me. I would forget it fain;
-    But O, it presses to my memory
-    Like damned guilty deeds to sinners' minds!
-    'Tybalt is dead, and Romeo- banished.'
-    That 'banished,' that one word 'banished,'
-    Hath slain ten thousand Tybalts. Tybalt's death
-    Was woe enough, if it had ended there;
-    Or, if sour woe delights in fellowship
-    And needly will be rank'd with other griefs,
-    Why followed not, when she said 'Tybalt's dead,'
-    Thy father, or thy mother, nay, or both,
-    Which modern lamentation might have mov'd?
-    But with a rearward following Tybalt's death,
-    'Romeo is banished'- to speak that word
-    Is father, mother, Tybalt, Romeo, Juliet,
-    All slain, all dead. 'Romeo is banished'-
-    There is no end, no limit, measure, bound,
-    In that word's death; no words can that woe sound.
-    Where is my father and my mother, nurse?
-
-  Nurse. Weeping and wailing over Tybalt's corse.
-    Will you go to them? I will bring you thither.
-
-  Jul. Wash they his wounds with tears? Mine shall be spent,
-    When theirs are dry, for Romeo's banishment.
-    Take up those cords. Poor ropes, you are beguil'd,
-    Both you and I, for Romeo is exil'd.
-    He made you for a highway to my bed;
-    But I, a maid, die maiden-widowed.
-    Come, cords; come, nurse. I'll to my wedding bed;
-    And death, not Romeo, take my maidenhead!
-
-  Nurse. Hie to your chamber. I'll find Romeo
-    To comfort you. I wot well where he is.
-    Hark ye, your Romeo will be here at night.
-    I'll to him; he is hid at Laurence' cell.
-
-  Jul. O, find him! give this ring to my true knight
-    And bid him come to take his last farewell.
-                                                         Exeunt.

-
-
-Scene III.
-Friar Laurence's cell.
-
-Enter Friar [Laurence].
-
-
-  Friar. Romeo, come forth; come forth, thou fearful man.
-    Affliction is enanmour'd of thy parts,
-    And thou art wedded to calamity.
-
-                         Enter Romeo.
-
-
-  Rom. Father, what news? What is the Prince's doom
-    What sorrow craves acquaintance at my hand
-    That I yet know not?
-
-  Friar. Too familiar
-    Is my dear son with such sour company.
-    I bring thee tidings of the Prince's doom.
-
-  Rom. What less than doomsday is the Prince's doom?
-
-  Friar. A gentler judgment vanish'd from his lips-
-    Not body's death, but body's banishment.
-
-  Rom. Ha, banishment? Be merciful, say 'death';
-    For exile hath more terror in his look,
-    Much more than death. Do not say 'banishment.'
-
-  Friar. Hence from Verona art thou banished.
-    Be patient, for the world is broad and wide.
-
-  Rom. There is no world without Verona walls,
-    But purgatory, torture, hell itself.
-    Hence banished is banish'd from the world,
-    And world's exile is death. Then 'banishment'
-    Is death misterm'd. Calling death 'banishment,'
-    Thou cut'st my head off with a golden axe
-    And smilest upon the stroke that murders me.
-
-  Friar. O deadly sin! O rude unthankfulness!
-    Thy fault our law calls death; but the kind Prince,
-    Taking thy part, hath rush'd aside the law,
-    And turn'd that black word death to banishment.
-    This is dear mercy, and thou seest it not.
-
-  Rom. 'Tis torture, and not mercy. Heaven is here,
-    Where Juliet lives; and every cat and dog
-    And little mouse, every unworthy thing,
-    Live here in heaven and may look on her;
-    But Romeo may not. More validity,
-    More honourable state, more courtship lives
-    In carrion flies than Romeo. They may seize
-    On the white wonder of dear Juliet's hand
-    And steal immortal blessing from her lips,
-    Who, even in pure and vestal modesty,
-    Still blush, as thinking their own kisses sin;
-    But Romeo may not- he is banished.
-    This may flies do, when I from this must fly;
-    They are free men, but I am banished.
-    And sayest thou yet that exile is not death?
-    Hadst thou no poison mix'd, no sharp-ground knife,
-    No sudden mean of death, though ne'er so mean,
-    But 'banished' to kill me- 'banished'?
-    O friar, the damned use that word in hell;
-    Howling attends it! How hast thou the heart,
-    Being a divine, a ghostly confessor,
-    A sin-absolver, and my friend profess'd,
-    To mangle me with that word 'banished'?
-
-  Friar. Thou fond mad man, hear me a little speak.
-
-  Rom. O, thou wilt speak again of banishment.
-
-  Friar. I'll give thee armour to keep off that word;
-    Adversity's sweet milk, philosophy,
-    To comfort thee, though thou art banished.
-
-  Rom. Yet 'banished'? Hang up philosophy!
-    Unless philosophy can make a Juliet,
-    Displant a town, reverse a prince's doom,
-    It helps not, it prevails not. Talk no more.
-
-  Friar. O, then I see that madmen have no ears.
-
-  Rom. How should they, when that wise men have no eyes?
-
-  Friar. Let me dispute with thee of thy estate.
-
-  Rom. Thou canst not speak of that thou dost not feel.
-    Wert thou as young as I, Juliet thy love,
-    An hour but married, Tybalt murdered,
-    Doting like me, and like me banished,
-    Then mightst thou speak, then mightst thou tear thy hair,
-    And fall upon the ground, as I do now,
-    Taking the measure of an unmade grave.
-                                                 Knock [within].
-
-  Friar. Arise; one knocks. Good Romeo, hide thyself.
-
-  Rom. Not I; unless the breath of heartsick groans,
-    Mist-like infold me from the search of eyes.          Knock.
-
-  Friar. Hark, how they knock! Who's there? Romeo, arise;
-    Thou wilt be taken.- Stay awhile!- Stand up;          Knock.
-    Run to my study.- By-and-by!- God's will,
-    What simpleness is this.- I come, I come!             Knock.
-    Who knocks so hard? Whence come you? What's your will
-
-  Nurse. [within] Let me come in, and you shall know my errand.
-    I come from Lady Juliet.
-
-  Friar. Welcome then.
-
-                       Enter Nurse.
-
-
-  Nurse. O holy friar, O, tell me, holy friar
-    Where is my lady's lord, where's Romeo?
-
-  Friar. There on the ground, with his own tears made drunk.
-
-  Nurse. O, he is even in my mistress' case,
-    Just in her case!
-
-  Friar. O woeful sympathy!
-    Piteous predicament!
-
-  Nurse. Even so lies she,
-    Blubb'ring and weeping, weeping and blubbering.
-    Stand up, stand up! Stand, an you be a man.
-    For Juliet's sake, for her sake, rise and stand!
-    Why should you fall into so deep an O?
-
-  Rom. (rises) Nurse-
-
-  Nurse. Ah sir! ah sir! Well, death's the end of all.
-
-  Rom. Spakest thou of Juliet? How is it with her?
-    Doth not she think me an old murtherer,
-    Now I have stain'd the childhood of our joy
-    With blood remov'd but little from her own?
-    Where is she? and how doth she! and what says
-    My conceal'd lady to our cancell'd love?
-
-  Nurse. O, she says nothing, sir, but weeps and weeps;
-    And now falls on her bed, and then starts up,
-    And Tybalt calls; and then on Romeo cries,
-    And then down falls again.
-
-  Rom. As if that name,
-    Shot from the deadly level of a gun,
-    Did murther her; as that name's cursed hand
-    Murder'd her kinsman. O, tell me, friar, tell me,
-    In what vile part of this anatomy
-    Doth my name lodge? Tell me, that I may sack
-    The hateful mansion.                     [Draws his dagger.]
-
-  Friar. Hold thy desperate hand.
-    Art thou a man? Thy form cries out thou art;
-    Thy tears are womanish, thy wild acts denote
-    The unreasonable fury of a beast.
-    Unseemly woman in a seeming man!
-    Or ill-beseeming beast in seeming both!
-    Thou hast amaz'd me. By my holy order,
-    I thought thy disposition better temper'd.
-    Hast thou slain Tybalt? Wilt thou slay thyself?
-    And slay thy lady that in thy life lives,
-    By doing damned hate upon thyself?
-    Why railest thou on thy birth, the heaven, and earth?
-    Since birth and heaven and earth, all three do meet
-    In thee at once; which thou at once wouldst lose.
-    Fie, fie, thou shamest thy shape, thy love, thy wit,
-    Which, like a usurer, abound'st in all,
-    And usest none in that true use indeed
-    Which should bedeck thy shape, thy love, thy wit.
-    Thy noble shape is but a form of wax
-    Digressing from the valour of a man;
-    Thy dear love sworn but hollow perjury,
-    Killing that love which thou hast vow'd to cherish;
-    Thy wit, that ornament to shape and love,
-    Misshapen in the conduct of them both,
-    Like powder in a skilless soldier's flask,
-    is get afire by thine own ignorance,
-    And thou dismemb'red with thine own defence.
-    What, rouse thee, man! Thy Juliet is alive,
-    For whose dear sake thou wast but lately dead.
-    There art thou happy. Tybalt would kill thee,
-    But thou slewest Tybalt. There art thou happy too.
-    The law, that threat'ned death, becomes thy friend
-    And turns it to exile. There art thou happy.
-    A pack of blessings light upon thy back;
-    Happiness courts thee in her best array;
-    But, like a misbhav'd and sullen wench,
-    Thou pout'st upon thy fortune and thy love.
-    Take heed, take heed, for such die miserable.
-    Go get thee to thy love, as was decreed,
-    Ascend her chamber, hence and comfort her.
-    But look thou stay not till the watch be set,
-    For then thou canst not pass to Mantua,
-    Where thou shalt live till we can find a time
-    To blaze your marriage, reconcile your friends,
-    Beg pardon of the Prince, and call thee back
-    With twenty hundred thousand times more joy
-    Than thou went'st forth in lamentation.
-    Go before, nurse. Commend me to thy lady,
-    And bid her hasten all the house to bed,
-    Which heavy sorrow makes them apt unto.
-    Romeo is coming.
-
-  Nurse. O Lord, I could have stay'd here all the night
-    To hear good counsel. O, what learning is!
-    My lord, I'll tell my lady you will come.
-
-  Rom. Do so, and bid my sweet prepare to chide.
-
-  Nurse. Here is a ring she bid me give you, sir.
-    Hie you, make haste, for it grows very late.           Exit.
-
-  Rom. How well my comfort is reviv'd by this!
-
-  Friar. Go hence; good night; and here stands all your state:
-    Either be gone before the watch be set,
-    Or by the break of day disguis'd from hence.
-    Sojourn in Mantua. I'll find out your man,
-    And he shall signify from time to time
-    Every good hap to you that chances here.
-    Give me thy hand. 'Tis late. Farewell; good night.
-
-  Rom. But that a joy past joy calls out on me,
-    It were a grief so brief to part with thee.
-    Farewell.
-                                                         Exeunt.

-
-Scene IV.
-Capulet's house
-
-Enter Old Capulet, his Wife, and Paris.
-
-
-  Cap. Things have fall'n out, sir, so unluckily
-    That we have had no time to move our daughter.
-    Look you, she lov'd her kinsman Tybalt dearly,
-    And so did I. Well, we were born to die.
-    'Tis very late; she'll not come down to-night.
-    I promise you, but for your company,
-    I would have been abed an hour ago.
-
-  Par. These times of woe afford no tune to woo.
-    Madam, good night. Commend me to your daughter.
-
-  Lady. I will, and know her mind early to-morrow;
-    To-night she's mew'd up to her heaviness.
-
-  Cap. Sir Paris, I will make a desperate tender
-    Of my child's love. I think she will be rul'd
-    In all respects by me; nay more, I doubt it not.
-    Wife, go you to her ere you go to bed;
-    Acquaint her here of my son Paris' love
-    And bid her (mark you me?) on Wednesday next-
-    But, soft! what day is this?
-
-  Par. Monday, my lord.
-
-  Cap. Monday! ha, ha! Well, Wednesday is too soon.
-    Thursday let it be- a Thursday, tell her
-    She shall be married to this noble earl.
-    Will you be ready? Do you like this haste?
-    We'll keep no great ado- a friend or two;
-    For hark you, Tybalt being slain so late,
-    It may be thought we held him carelessly,
-    Being our kinsman, if we revel much.
-    Therefore we'll have some half a dozen friends,
-    And there an end. But what say you to Thursday?
-
-  Par. My lord, I would that Thursday were to-morrow.
-
-  Cap. Well, get you gone. A Thursday be it then.
-    Go you to Juliet ere you go to bed;
-    Prepare her, wife, against this wedding day.
-    Farewell, My lord.- Light to my chamber, ho!
-    Afore me, It is so very very late
-    That we may call it early by-and-by.
-    Good night.
-                                                          Exeunt

-
-
-
-Scene V.
-Capulet's orchard.
-
-Enter Romeo and Juliet aloft, at the Window.
-
-
-  Jul. Wilt thou be gone? It is not yet near day.
-    It was the nightingale, and not the lark,
-    That pierc'd the fearful hollow of thine ear.
-    Nightly she sings on yond pomegranate tree.
-    Believe me, love, it was the nightingale.
-
-  Rom. It was the lark, the herald of the morn;
-    No nightingale. Look, love, what envious streaks
-    Do lace the severing clouds in yonder East.
-    Night's candles are burnt out, and jocund day
-    Stands tiptoe on the misty mountain tops.
-    I must be gone and live, or stay and die.
-
-  Jul. Yond light is not daylight; I know it, I.
-    It is some meteor that the sun exhales
-    To be to thee this night a torchbearer
-    And light thee on the way to Mantua.
-    Therefore stay yet; thou need'st not to be gone.
-
-  Rom. Let me be ta'en, let me be put to death.
-    I am content, so thou wilt have it so.
-    I'll say yon grey is not the morning's eye,
-    'Tis but the pale reflex of Cynthia's brow;
-    Nor that is not the lark whose notes do beat
-    The vaulty heaven so high above our heads.
-    I have more care to stay than will to go.
-    Come, death, and welcome! Juliet wills it so.
-    How is't, my soul? Let's talk; it is not day.
-
-  Jul. It is, it is! Hie hence, be gone, away!
-    It is the lark that sings so out of tune,
-    Straining harsh discords and unpleasing sharps.
-    Some say the lark makes sweet division;
-    This doth not so, for she divideth us.
-    Some say the lark and loathed toad chang'd eyes;
-    O, now I would they had chang'd voices too,
-    Since arm from arm that voice doth us affray,
-    Hunting thee hence with hunt's-up to the day!
-    O, now be gone! More light and light it grows.
-
-  Rom. More light and light- more dark and dark our woes!
-
-                          Enter Nurse.
-
-
-  Nurse. Madam!
-
-  Jul. Nurse?
-
-  Nurse. Your lady mother is coming to your chamber.
-    The day is broke; be wary, look about.
-
-  Jul. Then, window, let day in, and let life out.
-                                                         [Exit.]
-
-  Rom. Farewell, farewell! One kiss, and I'll descend.
-                                                  He goeth down.
-
-  Jul. Art thou gone so, my lord, my love, my friend?
-    I must hear from thee every day in the hour,
-    For in a minute there are many days.
-    O, by this count I shall be much in years
-    Ere I again behold my Romeo!
-
-  Rom. Farewell!
-    I will omit no opportunity
-    That may convey my greetings, love, to thee.
-
-  Jul. O, think'st thou we shall ever meet again?
-
-  Rom. I doubt it not; and all these woes shall serve
-    For sweet discourses in our time to come.
-
-  Jul. O God, I have an ill-divining soul!
-    Methinks I see thee, now thou art below,
-    As one dead in the bottom of a tomb.
-    Either my eyesight fails, or thou look'st pale.
-
-  Rom. And trust me, love, in my eye so do you.
-    Dry sorrow drinks our blood. Adieu, adieu!
-Exit.
-
-  Jul. O Fortune, Fortune! all men call thee fickle.
-    If thou art fickle, what dost thou with him
-    That is renown'd for faith? Be fickle, Fortune,
-    For then I hope thou wilt not keep him long
-    But send him back.
-
-  Lady. [within] Ho, daughter! are you up?
-
-  Jul. Who is't that calls? It is my lady mother.
-    Is she not down so late, or up so early?
-    What unaccustom'd cause procures her hither?
-
-                       Enter Mother.
-
-
-  Lady. Why, how now, Juliet?
-
-  Jul. Madam, I am not well.
-
-  Lady. Evermore weeping for your cousin's death?
-    What, wilt thou wash him from his grave with tears?
-    An if thou couldst, thou couldst not make him live.
-    Therefore have done. Some grief shows much of love;
-    But much of grief shows still some want of wit.
-
-  Jul. Yet let me weep for such a feeling loss.
-
-  Lady. So shall you feel the loss, but not the friend
-    Which you weep for.
-
-  Jul. Feeling so the loss,
-    I cannot choose but ever weep the friend.
-
-  Lady. Well, girl, thou weep'st not so much for his death
-    As that the villain lives which slaughter'd him.
-
-  Jul. What villain, madam?
-
-  Lady. That same villain Romeo.
-
-  Jul. [aside] Villain and he be many miles asunder.-
-    God pardon him! I do, with all my heart;
-    And yet no man like he doth grieve my heart.
-
-  Lady. That is because the traitor murderer lives.
-
-  Jul. Ay, madam, from the reach of these my hands.
-    Would none but I might venge my cousin's death!
-
-  Lady. We will have vengeance for it, fear thou not.
-    Then weep no more. I'll send to one in Mantua,
-    Where that same banish'd runagate doth live,
-    Shall give him such an unaccustom'd dram
-    That he shall soon keep Tybalt company;
-    And then I hope thou wilt be satisfied.
-
-  Jul. Indeed I never shall be satisfied
-    With Romeo till I behold him- dead-
-    Is my poor heart so for a kinsman vex'd.
-    Madam, if you could find out but a man
-    To bear a poison, I would temper it;
-    That Romeo should, upon receipt thereof,
-    Soon sleep in quiet. O, how my heart abhors
-    To hear him nam'd and cannot come to him,
-    To wreak the love I bore my cousin Tybalt
-    Upon his body that hath slaughter'd him!
-
-  Lady. Find thou the means, and I'll find such a man.
-    But now I'll tell thee joyful tidings, girl.
-
-  Jul. And joy comes well in such a needy time.
-    What are they, I beseech your ladyship?
-
-  Lady. Well, well, thou hast a careful father, child;
-    One who, to put thee from thy heaviness,
-    Hath sorted out a sudden day of joy
-    That thou expects not nor I look'd not for.
-
-  Jul. Madam, in happy time! What day is that?
-
-  Lady. Marry, my child, early next Thursday morn
-    The gallant, young, and noble gentleman,
-    The County Paris, at Saint Peter's Church,
-    Shall happily make thee there a joyful bride.
-
-  Jul. Now by Saint Peter's Church, and Peter too,
-    He shall not make me there a joyful bride!
-    I wonder at this haste, that I must wed
-    Ere he that should be husband comes to woo.
-    I pray you tell my lord and father, madam,
-    I will not marry yet; and when I do, I swear
-    It shall be Romeo, whom you know I hate,
-    Rather than Paris. These are news indeed!
-
-  Lady. Here comes your father. Tell him so yourself,
-    And see how be will take it at your hands.
-
-                   Enter Capulet and Nurse.
-
-
-  Cap. When the sun sets the air doth drizzle dew,
-    But for the sunset of my brother's son
-    It rains downright.
-    How now? a conduit, girl? What, still in tears?
-    Evermore show'ring? In one little body
-    Thou counterfeit'st a bark, a sea, a wind:
-    For still thy eyes, which I may call the sea,
-    Do ebb and flow with tears; the bark thy body is
-    Sailing in this salt flood; the winds, thy sighs,
-    Who, raging with thy tears and they with them,
-    Without a sudden calm will overset
-    Thy tempest-tossed body. How now, wife?
-    Have you delivered to her our decree?
-
-  Lady. Ay, sir; but she will none, she gives you thanks.
-    I would the fool were married to her grave!
-
-  Cap. Soft! take me with you, take me with you, wife.
-    How? Will she none? Doth she not give us thanks?
-    Is she not proud? Doth she not count her blest,
-    Unworthy as she is, that we have wrought
-    So worthy a gentleman to be her bridegroom?
-
-  Jul. Not proud you have, but thankful that you have.
-    Proud can I never be of what I hate,
-    But thankful even for hate that is meant love.
-
-  Cap. How, how, how, how, choplogic? What is this?
-    'Proud'- and 'I thank you'- and 'I thank you not'-
-    And yet 'not proud'? Mistress minion you,
-    Thank me no thankings, nor proud me no prouds,
-    But fettle your fine joints 'gainst Thursday next
-    To go with Paris to Saint Peter's Church,
-    Or I will drag thee on a hurdle thither.
-    Out, you green-sickness carrion I out, you baggage!
-    You tallow-face!
-
-  Lady. Fie, fie! what, are you mad?
-
-  Jul. Good father, I beseech you on my knees,
-    Hear me with patience but to speak a word.
-
-  Cap. Hang thee, young baggage! disobedient wretch!
-    I tell thee what- get thee to church a Thursday
-    Or never after look me in the face.
-    Speak not, reply not, do not answer me!
-    My fingers itch. Wife, we scarce thought us blest
-    That God had lent us but this only child;
-    But now I see this one is one too much,
-    And that we have a curse in having her.
-    Out on her, hilding!
-
-  Nurse. God in heaven bless her!
-    You are to blame, my lord, to rate her so.
-
-  Cap. And why, my Lady Wisdom? Hold your tongue,
-    Good Prudence. Smatter with your gossips, go!
-
-  Nurse. I speak no treason.
-
-  Cap. O, God-i-god-en!
-
-  Nurse. May not one speak?
-
-  Cap. Peace, you mumbling fool!
-    Utter your gravity o'er a gossip's bowl,
-    For here we need it not.
-
-  Lady. You are too hot.
-
-  Cap. God's bread I it makes me mad. Day, night, late, early,
-    At home, abroad, alone, in company,
-    Waking or sleeping, still my care hath been
-    To have her match'd; and having now provided
-    A gentleman of princely parentage,
-    Of fair demesnes, youthful, and nobly train'd,
-    Stuff'd, as they say, with honourable parts,
-    Proportion'd as one's thought would wish a man-
-    And then to have a wretched puling fool,
-    A whining mammet, in her fortune's tender,
-    To answer 'I'll not wed, I cannot love;
-    I am too young, I pray you pardon me'!
-    But, an you will not wed, I'll pardon you.
-    Graze where you will, you shall not house with me.
-    Look to't, think on't; I do not use to jest.
-    Thursday is near; lay hand on heart, advise:
-    An you be mine, I'll give you to my friend;
-    An you be not, hang, beg, starve, die in the streets,
-    For, by my soul, I'll ne'er acknowledge thee,
-    Nor what is mine shall never do thee good.
-    Trust to't. Bethink you. I'll not be forsworn.         Exit.
-
-  Jul. Is there no pity sitting in the clouds
-    That sees into the bottom of my grief?
-    O sweet my mother, cast me not away!
-    Delay this marriage for a month, a week;
-    Or if you do not, make the bridal bed
-    In that dim monument where Tybalt lies.
-
-  Lady. Talk not to me, for I'll not speak a word.
-    Do as thou wilt, for I have done with thee.            Exit.
-
-  Jul. O God!- O nurse, how shall this be prevented?
-    My husband is on earth, my faith in heaven.
-    How shall that faith return again to earth
-    Unless that husband send it me from heaven
-    By leaving earth? Comfort me, counsel me.
-    Alack, alack, that heaven should practise stratagems
-    Upon so soft a subject as myself!
-    What say'st thou? Hast thou not a word of joy?
-    Some comfort, nurse.
-
-  Nurse. Faith, here it is.
-    Romeo is banish'd; and all the world to nothing
-    That he dares ne'er come back to challenge you;
-    Or if he do, it needs must be by stealth.
-    Then, since the case so stands as now it doth,
-    I think it best you married with the County.
-    O, he's a lovely gentleman!
-    Romeo's a dishclout to him. An eagle, madam,
-    Hath not so green, so quick, so fair an eye
-    As Paris hath. Beshrew my very heart,
-    I think you are happy in this second match,
-    For it excels your first; or if it did not,
-    Your first is dead- or 'twere as good he were
-    As living here and you no use of him.
-
-  Jul. Speak'st thou this from thy heart?
-
-  Nurse. And from my soul too; else beshrew them both.
-
-  Jul. Amen!
-
-  Nurse. What?
-
-  Jul. Well, thou hast comforted me marvellous much.
-    Go in; and tell my lady I am gone,
-    Having displeas'd my father, to Laurence' cell,
-    To make confession and to be absolv'd.
-
-  Nurse. Marry, I will; and this is wisely done.           Exit.
-
-  Jul. Ancient damnation! O most wicked fiend!
-    Is it more sin to wish me thus forsworn,
-    Or to dispraise my lord with that same tongue
-    Which she hath prais'd him with above compare
-    So many thousand times? Go, counsellor!
-    Thou and my bosom henceforth shall be twain.
-    I'll to the friar to know his remedy.
-    If all else fail, myself have power to die.            Exit.
-
-
-
-
-ACT IV. Scene I.
-Friar Laurence's cell.
-
-Enter Friar, [Laurence] and County Paris.
-
-
-  Friar. On Thursday, sir? The time is very short.
-
-  Par. My father Capulet will have it so,
-    And I am nothing slow to slack his haste.
-
-  Friar. You say you do not know the lady's mind.
-    Uneven is the course; I like it not.
-
-  Par. Immoderately she weeps for Tybalt's death,
-    And therefore have I little talk'd of love;
-    For Venus smiles not in a house of tears.
-    Now, sir, her father counts it dangerous
-    That she do give her sorrow so much sway,
-    And in his wisdom hastes our marriage
-    To stop the inundation of her tears,
-    Which, too much minded by herself alone,
-    May be put from her by society.
-    Now do you know the reason of this haste.
-
-  Friar. [aside] I would I knew not why it should be slow'd.-
-    Look, sir, here comes the lady toward my cell.
-
-                    Enter Juliet.
-
-
-  Par. Happily met, my lady and my wife!
-
-  Jul. That may be, sir, when I may be a wife.
-
-  Par. That may be must be, love, on Thursday next.
-
-  Jul. What must be shall be.
-
-  Friar. That's a certain text.
-
-  Par. Come you to make confession to this father?
-
-  Jul. To answer that, I should confess to you.
-
-  Par. Do not deny to him that you love me.
-
-  Jul. I will confess to you that I love him.
-
-  Par. So will ye, I am sure, that you love me.
-
-  Jul. If I do so, it will be of more price,
-    Being spoke behind your back, than to your face.
-
-  Par. Poor soul, thy face is much abus'd with tears.
-
-  Jul. The tears have got small victory by that,
-    For it was bad enough before their spite.
-
-  Par. Thou wrong'st it more than tears with that report.
-
-  Jul. That is no slander, sir, which is a truth;
-    And what I spake, I spake it to my face.
-
-  Par. Thy face is mine, and thou hast sland'red it.
-
-  Jul. It may be so, for it is not mine own.
-    Are you at leisure, holy father, now,
-    Or shall I come to you at evening mass
-
-  Friar. My leisure serves me, pensive daughter, now.
-    My lord, we must entreat the time alone.
-
-  Par. God shield I should disturb devotion!
-    Juliet, on Thursday early will I rouse ye.
-    Till then, adieu, and keep this holy kiss.             Exit.
-
-  Jul. O, shut the door! and when thou hast done so,
-    Come weep with me- past hope, past cure, past help!
-
-  Friar. Ah, Juliet, I already know thy grief;
-    It strains me past the compass of my wits.
-    I hear thou must, and nothing may prorogue it,
-    On Thursday next be married to this County.
-
-  Jul. Tell me not, friar, that thou hear'st of this,
-    Unless thou tell me how I may prevent it.
-    If in thy wisdom thou canst give no help,
-    Do thou but call my resolution wise
-    And with this knife I'll help it presently.
-    God join'd my heart and Romeo's, thou our hands;
-    And ere this hand, by thee to Romeo's seal'd,
-    Shall be the label to another deed,
-    Or my true heart with treacherous revolt
-    Turn to another, this shall slay them both.
-    Therefore, out of thy long-experienc'd time,
-    Give me some present counsel; or, behold,
-    'Twixt my extremes and me this bloody knife
-    Shall play the empire, arbitrating that
-    Which the commission of thy years and art
-    Could to no issue of true honour bring.
-    Be not so long to speak. I long to die
-    If what thou speak'st speak not of remedy.
-
-  Friar. Hold, daughter. I do spy a kind of hope,
-    Which craves as desperate an execution
-    As that is desperate which we would prevent.
-    If, rather than to marry County Paris
-    Thou hast the strength of will to slay thyself,
-    Then is it likely thou wilt undertake
-    A thing like death to chide away this shame,
-    That cop'st with death himself to scape from it;
-    And, if thou dar'st, I'll give thee remedy.
-
-  Jul. O, bid me leap, rather than marry Paris,
-    From off the battlements of yonder tower,
-    Or walk in thievish ways, or bid me lurk
-    Where serpents are; chain me with roaring bears,
-    Or shut me nightly in a charnel house,
-    O'ercover'd quite with dead men's rattling bones,
-    With reeky shanks and yellow chapless skulls;
-    Or bid me go into a new-made grave
-    And hide me with a dead man in his shroud-
-    Things that, to hear them told, have made me tremble-
-    And I will do it without fear or doubt,
-    To live an unstain'd wife to my sweet love.
-
-  Friar. Hold, then. Go home, be merry, give consent
-    To marry Paris. Wednesday is to-morrow.
-    To-morrow night look that thou lie alone;
-    Let not the nurse lie with thee in thy chamber.
-    Take thou this vial, being then in bed,
-    And this distilled liquor drink thou off;
-    When presently through all thy veins shall run
-    A cold and drowsy humour; for no pulse
-    Shall keep his native progress, but surcease;
-    No warmth, no breath, shall testify thou livest;
-    The roses in thy lips and cheeks shall fade
-    To paly ashes, thy eyes' windows fall
-    Like death when he shuts up the day of life;
-    Each part, depriv'd of supple government,
-    Shall, stiff and stark and cold, appear like death;
-    And in this borrowed likeness of shrunk death
-    Thou shalt continue two-and-forty hours,
-    And then awake as from a pleasant sleep.
-    Now, when the bridegroom in the morning comes
-    To rouse thee from thy bed, there art thou dead.
-    Then, as the manner of our country is,
-    In thy best robes uncovered on the bier
-    Thou shalt be borne to that same ancient vault
-    Where all the kindred of the Capulets lie.
-    In the mean time, against thou shalt awake,
-    Shall Romeo by my letters know our drift;
-    And hither shall he come; and he and I
-    Will watch thy waking, and that very night
-    Shall Romeo bear thee hence to Mantua.
-    And this shall free thee from this present shame,
-    If no inconstant toy nor womanish fear
-    Abate thy valour in the acting it.
-
-  Jul. Give me, give me! O, tell not me of fear!
-
-  Friar. Hold! Get you gone, be strong and prosperous
-    In this resolve. I'll send a friar with speed
-    To Mantua, with my letters to thy lord.
-
-  Jul. Love give me strength! and strength shall help afford.
-    Farewell, dear father.
-                                                         Exeunt.
-
-
-
-
-Scene II.
-Capulet's house.
-
-Enter Father Capulet, Mother, Nurse, and Servingmen,
-                        two or three.
-
-
-  Cap. So many guests invite as here are writ.
-                                            [Exit a Servingman.]
-    Sirrah, go hire me twenty cunning cooks.
-
-  Serv. You shall have none ill, sir; for I'll try if they can
-    lick their fingers.
-
-  Cap. How canst thou try them so?
-
-  Serv. Marry, sir, 'tis an ill cook that cannot lick his own
-    fingers. Therefore he that cannot lick his fingers goes not
-    with me.
-
-  Cap. Go, begone.
-                                                Exit Servingman.
-    We shall be much unfurnish'd for this time.
-    What, is my daughter gone to Friar Laurence?
-
-  Nurse. Ay, forsooth.
-
-  Cap. Well, be may chance to do some good on her.
-    A peevish self-will'd harlotry it is.
-
-                        Enter Juliet.
-
-
-  Nurse. See where she comes from shrift with merry look.
-
-  Cap. How now, my headstrong? Where have you been gadding?
-
-  Jul. Where I have learnt me to repent the sin
-    Of disobedient opposition
-    To you and your behests, and am enjoin'd
-    By holy Laurence to fall prostrate here
-    To beg your pardon. Pardon, I beseech you!
-    Henceforward I am ever rul'd by you.
-
-  Cap. Send for the County. Go tell him of this.
-    I'll have this knot knit up to-morrow morning.
-
-  Jul. I met the youthful lord at Laurence' cell
-    And gave him what becomed love I might,
-    Not stepping o'er the bounds of modesty.
-
-  Cap. Why, I am glad on't. This is well. Stand up.
-    This is as't should be. Let me see the County.
-    Ay, marry, go, I say, and fetch him hither.
-    Now, afore God, this reverend holy friar,
-    All our whole city is much bound to him.
-
-  Jul. Nurse, will you go with me into my closet
-    To help me sort such needful ornaments
-    As you think fit to furnish me to-morrow?
-
-  Mother. No, not till Thursday. There is time enough.
-
-  Cap. Go, nurse, go with her. We'll to church to-morrow.
-                                        Exeunt Juliet and Nurse.
-
-  Mother. We shall be short in our provision.
-    'Tis now near night.
-
-  Cap. Tush, I will stir about,
-    And all things shall be well, I warrant thee, wife.
-    Go thou to Juliet, help to deck up her.
-    I'll not to bed to-night; let me alone.
-    I'll play the housewife for this once. What, ho!
-    They are all forth; well, I will walk myself
-    To County Paris, to prepare him up
-    Against to-morrow. My heart is wondrous light,
-    Since this same wayward girl is so reclaim'd.
-                                                         Exeunt.
-
-
-
-
-Scene III.
-Juliet's chamber.
-
-Enter Juliet and Nurse.
-
-
-  Jul. Ay, those attires are best; but, gentle nurse,
-    I pray thee leave me to myself to-night;
-    For I have need of many orisons
-    To move the heavens to smile upon my state,
-    Which, well thou knowest, is cross and full of sin.
-
-                          Enter Mother.
-
-
-  Mother. What, are you busy, ho? Need you my help?
-
-  Jul. No, madam; we have cull'd such necessaries
-    As are behooffull for our state to-morrow.
-    So please you, let me now be left alone,
-    And let the nurse this night sit up with you;
-    For I am sure you have your hands full all
-    In this so sudden business.
-
-  Mother. Good night.
-    Get thee to bed, and rest; for thou hast need.
-                                      Exeunt [Mother and Nurse.]
-
-  Jul. Farewell! God knows when we shall meet again.
-    I have a faint cold fear thrills through my veins
-    That almost freezes up the heat of life.
-    I'll call them back again to comfort me.
-    Nurse!- What should she do here?
-    My dismal scene I needs must act alone.
-    Come, vial.
-    What if this mixture do not work at all?
-    Shall I be married then to-morrow morning?
-    No, No! This shall forbid it. Lie thou there.
-                                             Lays down a dagger.
-    What if it be a poison which the friar
-    Subtilly hath minist'red to have me dead,
-    Lest in this marriage he should be dishonour'd
-    Because he married me before to Romeo?
-    I fear it is; and yet methinks it should not,
-    For he hath still been tried a holy man.
-    I will not entertain so bad a thought.
-    How if, when I am laid into the tomb,
-    I wake before the time that Romeo
-    Come to redeem me? There's a fearful point!
-    Shall I not then be stifled in the vault,
-    To whose foul mouth no healthsome air breathes in,
-    And there die strangled ere my Romeo comes?
-    Or, if I live, is it not very like
-    The horrible conceit of death and night,
-    Together with the terror of the place-
-    As in a vault, an ancient receptacle
-    Where for this many hundred years the bones
-    Of all my buried ancestors are pack'd;
-    Where bloody Tybalt, yet but green in earth,
-    Lies fest'ring in his shroud; where, as they say,
-    At some hours in the night spirits resort-
-    Alack, alack, is it not like that I,
-    So early waking- what with loathsome smells,
-    And shrieks like mandrakes torn out of the earth,
-    That living mortals, hearing them, run mad-
-    O, if I wake, shall I not be distraught,
-    Environed with all these hideous fears,
-    And madly play with my forefathers' joints,
-    And pluck the mangled Tybalt from his shroud.,
-    And, in this rage, with some great kinsman's bone
-    As with a club dash out my desp'rate brains?
-    O, look! methinks I see my cousin's ghost
-    Seeking out Romeo, that did spit his body
-    Upon a rapier's point. Stay, Tybalt, stay!
-    Romeo, I come! this do I drink to thee.
-
-        She [drinks and] falls upon her bed within the curtains.
-

-
-Scene IV.
-Capulet's house.
-
-Enter Lady of the House and Nurse.
-
-
-  Lady. Hold, take these keys and fetch more spices, nurse.
-
-  Nurse. They call for dates and quinces in the pastry.
-
-                       Enter Old Capulet.
-
-
-  Cap. Come, stir, stir, stir! The second cock hath crow'd,
-    The curfew bell hath rung, 'tis three o'clock.
-    Look to the bak'd meats, good Angelica;
-    Spare not for cost.
-
-  Nurse. Go, you cot-quean, go,
-    Get you to bed! Faith, you'll be sick to-morrow
-    For this night's watching.
-
-  Cap. No, not a whit. What, I have watch'd ere now
-    All night for lesser cause, and ne'er been sick.
-
-  Lady. Ay, you have been a mouse-hunt in your time;
-    But I will watch you from such watching now.
-                                          Exeunt Lady and Nurse.
-
-  Cap. A jealous hood, a jealous hood!
-
-
-  Enter three or four [Fellows, with spits and logs and baskets.
-
-    What is there? Now, fellow,
-
-  Fellow. Things for the cook, sir; but I know not what.
-
-  Cap. Make haste, make haste. [Exit Fellow.] Sirrah, fetch drier
-      logs.
-    Call Peter; he will show thee where they are.
-
-  Fellow. I have a head, sir, that will find out logs
-    And never trouble Peter for the matter.
-
-  Cap. Mass, and well said; a merry whoreson, ha!
-    Thou shalt be loggerhead. [Exit Fellow.] Good faith, 'tis day.
-    The County will be here with music straight,
-    For so he said he would.                         Play music.
-    I hear him near.
-    Nurse! Wife! What, ho! What, nurse, I say!
-
-                              Enter Nurse.
-    Go waken Juliet; go and trim her up.
-    I'll go and chat with Paris. Hie, make haste,
-    Make haste! The bridegroom he is come already:
-    Make haste, I say.
-                                                       [Exeunt.]
-
-
-
-
-Scene V.
-Juliet's chamber.
-
-[Enter Nurse.]
-
-
-  Nurse. Mistress! what, mistress! Juliet! Fast, I warrant her, she.
-    Why, lamb! why, lady! Fie, you slug-abed!
-    Why, love, I say! madam! sweetheart! Why, bride!
-    What, not a word? You take your pennyworths now!
-    Sleep for a week; for the next night, I warrant,
-    The County Paris hath set up his rest
-    That you shall rest but little. God forgive me!
-    Marry, and amen. How sound is she asleep!
-    I needs must wake her. Madam, madam, madam!
-    Ay, let the County take you in your bed!
-    He'll fright you up, i' faith. Will it not be?
-                                     [Draws aside the curtains.]
-    What, dress'd, and in your clothes, and down again?
-    I must needs wake you. Lady! lady! lady!
-    Alas, alas! Help, help! My lady's dead!
-    O weraday that ever I was born!
-    Some aqua-vitae, ho! My lord! my lady!
-
-                           Enter Mother.
-
-
-  Mother. What noise is here?
-
-  Nurse. O lamentable day!
-
-  Mother. What is the matter?
-
-  Nurse. Look, look! O heavy day!
-
-  Mother. O me, O me! My child, my only life!
-    Revive, look up, or I will die with thee!
-    Help, help! Call help.
-
-                            Enter Father.
-
-
-  Father. For shame, bring Juliet forth; her lord is come.
-
-  Nurse. She's dead, deceas'd; she's dead! Alack the day!
-
-  Mother. Alack the day, she's dead, she's dead, she's dead!
-
-  Cap. Ha! let me see her. Out alas! she's cold,
-    Her blood is settled, and her joints are stiff;
-    Life and these lips have long been separated.
-    Death lies on her like an untimely frost
-    Upon the sweetest flower of all the field.
-
-  Nurse. O lamentable day!
-
-  Mother. O woful time!
-
-  Cap. Death, that hath ta'en her hence to make me wail,
-    Ties up my tongue and will not let me speak.
-
-
-  Enter Friar [Laurence] and the County [Paris], with Musicians.
-
-
-  Friar. Come, is the bride ready to go to church?
-
-  Cap. Ready to go, but never to return.
-    O son, the night before thy wedding day
-    Hath Death lain with thy wife. See, there she lies,
-    Flower as she was, deflowered by him.
-    Death is my son-in-law, Death is my heir;
-    My daughter he hath wedded. I will die
-    And leave him all. Life, living, all is Death's.
-
-  Par. Have I thought long to see this morning's face,
-    And doth it give me such a sight as this?
-
-  Mother. Accurs'd, unhappy, wretched, hateful day!
-    Most miserable hour that e'er time saw
-    In lasting labour of his pilgrimage!
-    But one, poor one, one poor and loving child,
-    But one thing to rejoice and solace in,
-    And cruel Death hath catch'd it from my sight!
-
-  Nurse. O woe? O woful, woful, woful day!
-    Most lamentable day, most woful day
-    That ever ever I did yet behold!
-    O day! O day! O day! O hateful day!
-    Never was seen so black a day as this.
-    O woful day! O woful day!
-
-  Par. Beguil'd, divorced, wronged, spited, slain!
-    Most detestable Death, by thee beguil'd,
-    By cruel cruel thee quite overthrown!
-    O love! O life! not life, but love in death
-
-  Cap. Despis'd, distressed, hated, martyr'd, kill'd!
-    Uncomfortable time, why cam'st thou now
-    To murther, murther our solemnity?
-    O child! O child! my soul, and not my child!
-    Dead art thou, dead! alack, my child is dead,
-    And with my child my joys are buried!
-
-  Friar. Peace, ho, for shame! Confusion's cure lives not
-    In these confusions. Heaven and yourself
-    Had part in this fair maid! now heaven hath all,
-    And all the better is it for the maid.
-    Your part in her you could not keep from death,
-    But heaven keeps his part in eternal life.
-    The most you sought was her promotion,
-    For 'twas your heaven she should be advanc'd;
-    And weep ye now, seeing she is advanc'd
-    Above the clouds, as high as heaven itself?
-    O, in this love, you love your child so ill
-    That you run mad, seeing that she is well.
-    She's not well married that lives married long,
-    But she's best married that dies married young.
-    Dry up your tears and stick your rosemary
-    On this fair corse, and, as the custom is,
-    In all her best array bear her to church;
-    For though fond nature bids us all lament,
-    Yet nature's tears are reason's merriment.
-
-  Cap. All things that we ordained festival
-    Turn from their office to black funeral-
-    Our instruments to melancholy bells,
-    Our wedding cheer to a sad burial feast;
-    Our solemn hymns to sullen dirges change;
-    Our bridal flowers serve for a buried corse;
-    And all things change them to the contrary.
-
-  Friar. Sir, go you in; and, madam, go with him;
-    And go, Sir Paris. Every one prepare
-    To follow this fair corse unto her grave.
-    The heavens do low'r upon you for some ill;
-    Move them no more by crossing their high will.
-                           Exeunt. Manent Musicians [and Nurse].
-  1. Mus. Faith, we may put up our pipes and be gone.
-
-  Nurse. Honest good fellows, ah, put up, put up!
-    For well you know this is a pitiful case.            [Exit.]
-  1. Mus. Ay, by my troth, the case may be amended.
-
-                         Enter Peter.
-
-
-  Pet. Musicians, O, musicians, 'Heart's ease,' 'Heart's ease'!
-    O, an you will have me live, play 'Heart's ease.'
-  1. Mus. Why 'Heart's ease'',
-
-  Pet. O, musicians, because my heart itself plays 'My heart is
-    full of woe.' O, play me some merry dump to comfort me.
-  1. Mus. Not a dump we! 'Tis no time to play now.
-
-  Pet. You will not then?
-  1. Mus. No.
-
-  Pet. I will then give it you soundly.
-  1. Mus. What will you give us?
-
-  Pet. No money, on my faith, but the gleek. I will give you the
-     minstrel.
-  1. Mus. Then will I give you the serving-creature.
-
-  Pet. Then will I lay the serving-creature's dagger on your pate.
-    I will carry no crotchets. I'll re you, I'll fa you. Do you
-    note me?
-  1. Mus. An you re us and fa us, you note us.
-  2. Mus. Pray you put up your dagger, and put out your wit.
-
-  Pet. Then have at you with my wit! I will dry-beat you with an
-    iron wit, and put up my iron dagger. Answer me like men.
-
-           'When griping grief the heart doth wound,
-             And doleful dumps the mind oppress,
-           Then music with her silver sound'-
-
-    Why 'silver sound'? Why 'music with her silver sound'?
-    What say you, Simon Catling?
-  1. Mus. Marry, sir, because silver hath a sweet sound.
-
-  Pet. Pretty! What say You, Hugh Rebeck?
-  2. Mus. I say 'silver sound' because musicians sound for silver.
-
-  Pet. Pretty too! What say you, James Soundpost?
-  3. Mus. Faith, I know not what to say.
-
-  Pet. O, I cry you mercy! you are the singer. I will say for you. It
-    is 'music with her silver sound' because musicians have no
-    gold for sounding.
-
-           'Then music with her silver sound
-             With speedy help doth lend redress.'         [Exit.
-
-  1. Mus. What a pestilent knave is this same?
-  2. Mus. Hang him, Jack! Come, we'll in here, tarry for the
-    mourners, and stay dinner.
-                                                         Exeunt.

-
-
-ACT V. Scene I.
-Mantua. A street.
-
-Enter Romeo.
-
-
-  Rom. If I may trust the flattering truth of sleep
-    My dreams presage some joyful news at hand.
-    My bosom's lord sits lightly in his throne,
-    And all this day an unaccustom'd spirit
-    Lifts me above the ground with cheerful thoughts.
-    I dreamt my lady came and found me dead
-    (Strange dream that gives a dead man leave to think!)
-    And breath'd such life with kisses in my lips
-    That I reviv'd and was an emperor.
-    Ah me! how sweet is love itself possess'd,
-    When but love's shadows are so rich in joy!
-
-                Enter Romeo's Man Balthasar, booted.
-
-    News from Verona! How now, Balthasar?
-    Dost thou not bring me letters from the friar?
-    How doth my lady? Is my father well?
-    How fares my Juliet? That I ask again,
-    For nothing can be ill if she be well.
-
-  Man. Then she is well, and nothing can be ill.
-    Her body sleeps in Capel's monument,
-    And her immortal part with angels lives.
-    I saw her laid low in her kindred's vault
-    And presently took post to tell it you.
-    O, pardon me for bringing these ill news,
-    Since you did leave it for my office, sir.
-
-  Rom. Is it e'en so? Then I defy you, stars!
-    Thou knowest my lodging. Get me ink and paper
-    And hire posthorses. I will hence to-night.
-
-  Man. I do beseech you, sir, have patience.
-    Your looks are pale and wild and do import
-    Some misadventure.
-
-  Rom. Tush, thou art deceiv'd.
-    Leave me and do the thing I bid thee do.
-    Hast thou no letters to me from the friar?
-
-  Man. No, my good lord.
-
-  Rom. No matter. Get thee gone
-    And hire those horses. I'll be with thee straight.
-                                               Exit [Balthasar].
-    Well, Juliet, I will lie with thee to-night.
-    Let's see for means. O mischief, thou art swift
-    To enter in the thoughts of desperate men!
-    I do remember an apothecary,
-    And hereabouts 'a dwells, which late I noted
-    In tatt'red weeds, with overwhelming brows,
-    Culling of simples. Meagre were his looks,
-    Sharp misery had worn him to the bones;
-    And in his needy shop a tortoise hung,
-    An alligator stuff'd, and other skins
-    Of ill-shaped fishes; and about his shelves
-    A beggarly account of empty boxes,
-    Green earthen pots, bladders, and musty seeds,
-    Remnants of packthread, and old cakes of roses
-    Were thinly scattered, to make up a show.
-    Noting this penury, to myself I said,
-    'An if a man did need a poison now
-    Whose sale is present death in Mantua,
-    Here lives a caitiff wretch would sell it him.'
-    O, this same thought did but forerun my need,
-    And this same needy man must sell it me.
-    As I remember, this should be the house.
-    Being holiday, the beggar's shop is shut. What, ho! apothecary!
-
-                        Enter Apothecary.
-
-
-  Apoth. Who calls so loud?
-
-  Rom. Come hither, man. I see that thou art poor.
-    Hold, there is forty ducats. Let me have
-    A dram of poison, such soon-speeding gear
-    As will disperse itself through all the veins
-    That the life-weary taker mall fall dead,
-    And that the trunk may be discharg'd of breath
-    As violently as hasty powder fir'd
-    Doth hurry from the fatal cannon's womb.
-
-  Apoth. Such mortal drugs I have; but Mantua's law
-    Is death to any he that utters them.
-
-  Rom. Art thou so bare and full of wretchedness
-    And fearest to die? Famine is in thy cheeks,
-    Need and oppression starveth in thine eyes,
-    Contempt and beggary hangs upon thy back:
-    The world is not thy friend, nor the world's law;
-    The world affords no law to make thee rich;
-    Then be not poor, but break it and take this.
-
-  Apoth. My poverty but not my will consents.
-
-  Rom. I pay thy poverty and not thy will.
-
-  Apoth. Put this in any liquid thing you will
-    And drink it off, and if you had the strength
-    Of twenty men, it would dispatch you straight.
-
-  Rom. There is thy gold- worse poison to men's souls,
-    Doing more murther in this loathsome world,
-    Than these poor compounds that thou mayst not sell.
-    I sell thee poison; thou hast sold me none.
-    Farewell. Buy food and get thyself in flesh.
-    Come, cordial and not poison, go with me
-    To Juliet's grave; for there must I use thee.
-                                                         Exeunt.
-
-
-
-
-Scene II.
-Verona. Friar Laurence's cell.
-
-Enter Friar John to Friar Laurence.
-
-
-  John. Holy Franciscan friar, brother, ho!
-
-                      Enter Friar Laurence.
-
-
-  Laur. This same should be the voice of Friar John.
-    Welcome from Mantua. What says Romeo?
-    Or, if his mind be writ, give me his letter.
-
-  John. Going to find a barefoot brother out,
-    One of our order, to associate me
-    Here in this city visiting the sick,
-    And finding him, the searchers of the town,
-    Suspecting that we both were in a house
-    Where the infectious pestilence did reign,
-    Seal'd up the doors, and would not let us forth,
-    So that my speed to Mantua there was stay'd.
-
-  Laur. Who bare my letter, then, to Romeo?
-
-  John. I could not send it- here it is again-
-    Nor get a messenger to bring it thee,
-    So fearful were they of infection.
-
-  Laur. Unhappy fortune! By my brotherhood,
-    The letter was not nice, but full of charge,
-    Of dear import; and the neglecting it
-    May do much danger. Friar John, go hence,
-    Get me an iron crow and bring it straight
-    Unto my cell.
-
-  John. Brother, I'll go and bring it thee.                 Exit.
-
-  Laur. Now, must I to the monument alone.
-    Within this three hours will fair Juliet wake.
-    She will beshrew me much that Romeo
-    Hath had no notice of these accidents;
-    But I will write again to Mantua,
-    And keep her at my cell till Romeo come-
-    Poor living corse, clos'd in a dead man's tomb!        Exit.
-
-
-
-
-Scene III.
-Verona. A churchyard; in it the monument of the Capulets.
-
-Enter Paris and his Page with flowers and [a torch].
-
-
-  Par. Give me thy torch, boy. Hence, and stand aloof.
-    Yet put it out, for I would not be seen.
-    Under yond yew tree lay thee all along,
-    Holding thine ear close to the hollow ground.
-    So shall no foot upon the churchyard tread
-    (Being loose, unfirm, with digging up of graves)
-    But thou shalt hear it. Whistle then to me,
-    As signal that thou hear'st something approach.
-    Give me those flowers. Do as I bid thee, go.
-
-  Page. [aside] I am almost afraid to stand alone
-    Here in the churchyard; yet I will adventure.     [Retires.]
-
-  Par. Sweet flower, with flowers thy bridal bed I strew
-    (O woe! thy canopy is dust and stones)
-    Which with sweet water nightly I will dew;
-    Or, wanting that, with tears distill'd by moans.
-    The obsequies that I for thee will keep
-    Nightly shall be to strew, thy grave and weep.
-                                                    Whistle Boy.
-    The boy gives warning something doth approach.
-    What cursed foot wanders this way to-night
-    To cross my obsequies and true love's rite?
-    What, with a torch? Muffle me, night, awhile.     [Retires.]
-
-       Enter Romeo, and Balthasar with a torch, a mattock,
-                    and a crow of iron.
-
-
-  Rom. Give me that mattock and the wrenching iron.
-    Hold, take this letter. Early in the morning
-    See thou deliver it to my lord and father.
-    Give me the light. Upon thy life I charge thee,
-    Whate'er thou hearest or seest, stand all aloof
-    And do not interrupt me in my course.
-    Why I descend into this bed of death
-    Is partly to behold my lady's face,
-    But chiefly to take thence from her dead finger
-    A precious ring- a ring that I must use
-    In dear employment. Therefore hence, be gone.
-    But if thou, jealous, dost return to pry
-    In what I farther shall intend to do,
-    By heaven, I will tear thee joint by joint
-    And strew this hungry churchyard with thy limbs.
-    The time and my intents are savage-wild,
-    More fierce and more inexorable far
-    Than empty tigers or the roaring sea.
-
-  Bal. I will be gone, sir, and not trouble you.
-
-  Rom. So shalt thou show me friendship. Take thou that.
-    Live, and be prosperous; and farewell, good fellow.
-
-  Bal. [aside] For all this same, I'll hide me hereabout.
-    His looks I fear, and his intents I doubt.        [Retires.]
-
-  Rom. Thou detestable maw, thou womb of death,
-    Gorg'd with the dearest morsel of the earth,
-    Thus I enforce thy rotten jaws to open,
-    And in despite I'll cram thee with more food.
-                                           Romeo opens the tomb.
-
-  Par. This is that banish'd haughty Montague
-    That murd'red my love's cousin- with which grief
-    It is supposed the fair creature died-
-    And here is come to do some villanous shame
-    To the dead bodies. I will apprehend him.
-    Stop thy unhallowed toil, vile Montague!
-    Can vengeance be pursu'd further than death?
-    Condemned villain, I do apprehend thee.
-    Obey, and go with me; for thou must die.
-
-  Rom. I must indeed; and therefore came I hither.
-    Good gentle youth, tempt not a desp'rate man.
-    Fly hence and leave me. Think upon these gone;
-    Let them affright thee. I beseech thee, youth,
-    But not another sin upon my head
-    By urging me to fury. O, be gone!
-    By heaven, I love thee better than myself,
-    For I come hither arm'd against myself.
-    Stay not, be gone. Live, and hereafter say
-    A madman's mercy bid thee run away.
-
-  Par. I do defy thy, conjuration
-    And apprehend thee for a felon here.
-
-  Rom. Wilt thou provoke me? Then have at thee, boy!
-                                                     They fight.
-
-  Page. O Lord, they fight! I will go call the watch.
-                                            [Exit. Paris falls.]
-
-  Par. O, I am slain! If thou be merciful,
-    Open the tomb, lay me with Juliet.                   [Dies.]
-
-  Rom. In faith, I will. Let me peruse this face.
-    Mercutio's kinsman, noble County Paris!
-    What said my man when my betossed soul
-    Did not attend him as we rode? I think
-    He told me Paris should have married Juliet.
-    Said he not so? or did I dream it so?
-    Or am I mad, hearing him talk of Juliet
-    To think it was so? O, give me thy hand,
-    One writ with me in sour misfortune's book!
-    I'll bury thee in a triumphant grave.
-    A grave? O, no, a lanthorn, slaught'red youth,
-    For here lies Juliet, and her beauty makes
-    This vault a feasting presence full of light.
-    Death, lie thou there, by a dead man interr'd.
-                                         [Lays him in the tomb.]
-    How oft when men are at the point of death
-    Have they been merry! which their keepers call
-    A lightning before death. O, how may I
-    Call this a lightning? O my love! my wife!
-    Death, that hath suck'd the honey of thy breath,
-    Hath had no power yet upon thy beauty.
-    Thou art not conquer'd. Beauty's ensign yet
-    Is crimson in thy lips and in thy cheeks,
-    And death's pale flag is not advanced there.
-    Tybalt, liest thou there in thy bloody sheet?
-    O, what more favour can I do to thee
-    Than with that hand that cut thy youth in twain
-    To sunder his that was thine enemy?
-    Forgive me, cousin.' Ah, dear Juliet,
-    Why art thou yet so fair? Shall I believe
-    That unsubstantial Death is amorous,
-    And that the lean abhorred monster keeps
-    Thee here in dark to be his paramour?
-    For fear of that I still will stay with thee
-    And never from this palace of dim night
-    Depart again. Here, here will I remain
-    With worms that are thy chambermaids. O, here
-    Will I set up my everlasting rest
-    And shake the yoke of inauspicious stars
-    From this world-wearied flesh. Eyes, look your last!
-    Arms, take your last embrace! and, lips, O you
-    The doors of breath, seal with a righteous kiss
-    A dateless bargain to engrossing death!
-    Come, bitter conduct; come, unsavoury guide!
-    Thou desperate pilot, now at once run on
-    The dashing rocks thy seasick weary bark!
-    Here's to my love! [Drinks.] O true apothecary!
-    Thy drugs are quick. Thus with a kiss I die.          Falls.
-
-    Enter Friar [Laurence], with lanthorn, crow, and spade.
-
-
-  Friar. Saint Francis be my speed! how oft to-night
-    Have my old feet stumbled at graves! Who's there?
-
-  Bal. Here's one, a friend, and one that knows you well.
-
-  Friar. Bliss be upon you! Tell me, good my friend,
-    What torch is yond that vainly lends his light
-    To grubs and eyeless skulls? As I discern,
-    It burneth in the Capels' monument.
-
-  Bal. It doth so, holy sir; and there's my master,
-    One that you love.
-
-  Friar. Who is it?
-
-  Bal. Romeo.
-
-  Friar. How long hath he been there?
-
-  Bal. Full half an hour.
-
-  Friar. Go with me to the vault.
-
-  Bal. I dare not, sir.
-    My master knows not but I am gone hence,
-    And fearfully did menace me with death
-    If I did stay to look on his intents.
-
-  Friar. Stay then; I'll go alone. Fear comes upon me.
-    O, much I fear some ill unthrifty thing.
-
-  Bal. As I did sleep under this yew tree here,
-    I dreamt my master and another fought,
-    And that my master slew him.
-
-  Friar. Romeo!
-    Alack, alack, what blood is this which stains
-    The stony entrance of this sepulchre?
-    What mean these masterless and gory swords
-    To lie discolour'd by this place of peace? [Enters the tomb.]
-    Romeo! O, pale! Who else? What, Paris too?
-    And steep'd in blood? Ah, what an unkind hour
-    Is guilty of this lamentable chance! The lady stirs.
-                                                   Juliet rises.
-
-  Jul. O comfortable friar! where is my lord?
-    I do remember well where I should be,
-    And there I am. Where is my Romeo?
-
-  Friar. I hear some noise. Lady, come from that nest
-    Of death, contagion, and unnatural sleep.
-    A greater power than we can contradict
-    Hath thwarted our intents. Come, come away.
-    Thy husband in thy bosom there lies dead;
-    And Paris too. Come, I'll dispose of thee
-    Among a sisterhood of holy nuns.
-    Stay not to question, for the watch is coming.
-    Come, go, good Juliet. I dare no longer stay.
-
-  Jul. Go, get thee hence, for I will not away.
-                                                   Exit [Friar].
-    What's here? A cup, clos'd in my true love's hand?
-    Poison, I see, hath been his timeless end.
-    O churl! drunk all, and left no friendly drop
-    To help me after? I will kiss thy lips.
-    Haply some poison yet doth hang on them
-    To make me die with a restorative.             [Kisses him.]
-    Thy lips are warm!
-
-  Chief Watch. [within] Lead, boy. Which way?
-    Yea, noise? Then I'll be brief. O happy dagger!
-                                      [Snatches Romeo's dagger.]
-    This is thy sheath; there rest, and let me die.
-                  She stabs herself and falls [on Romeo's body].
-
-                Enter [Paris's] Boy and Watch.
-
-
-  Boy. This is the place. There, where the torch doth burn.
-
-  Chief Watch. 'the ground is bloody. Search about the churchyard.
-    Go, some of you; whoe'er you find attach.
-                                     [Exeunt some of the Watch.]
-    Pitiful sight! here lies the County slain;
-    And Juliet bleeding, warm, and newly dead,
-    Who here hath lain this two days buried.
-    Go, tell the Prince; run to the Capulets;
-    Raise up the Montagues; some others search.
-                                   [Exeunt others of the Watch.]
-    We see the ground whereon these woes do lie,
-    But the true ground of all these piteous woes
-    We cannot without circumstance descry.
-
-     Enter [some of the Watch,] with Romeo's Man [Balthasar].
-
-  2. Watch. Here's Romeo's man. We found him in the churchyard.
-
-  Chief Watch. Hold him in safety till the Prince come hither.
-
-          Enter Friar [Laurence] and another Watchman.
-
-  3. Watch. Here is a friar that trembles, sighs, and weeps.
-    We took this mattock and this spade from him
-    As he was coming from this churchyard side.
-
-  Chief Watch. A great suspicion! Stay the friar too.
-
-              Enter the Prince [and Attendants].
-
-
-  Prince. What misadventure is so early up,
-    That calls our person from our morning rest?
-
-            Enter Capulet and his Wife [with others].
-
-
-  Cap. What should it be, that they so shriek abroad?
-
-  Wife. The people in the street cry 'Romeo,'
-    Some 'Juliet,' and some 'Paris'; and all run,
-    With open outcry, toward our monument.
-
-  Prince. What fear is this which startles in our ears?
-
-  Chief Watch. Sovereign, here lies the County Paris slain;
-    And Romeo dead; and Juliet, dead before,
-    Warm and new kill'd.
-
-  Prince. Search, seek, and know how this foul murder comes.
-
-  Chief Watch. Here is a friar, and slaughter'd Romeo's man,
-    With instruments upon them fit to open
-    These dead men's tombs.
-
-  Cap. O heavens! O wife, look how our daughter bleeds!
-    This dagger hath mista'en, for, lo, his house
-    Is empty on the back of Montague,
-    And it missheathed in my daughter's bosom!
-
-  Wife. O me! this sight of death is as a bell
-    That warns my old age to a sepulchre.
-
-               Enter Montague [and others].
-
-
-  Prince. Come, Montague; for thou art early up
-    To see thy son and heir more early down.
-
-  Mon. Alas, my liege, my wife is dead to-night!
-    Grief of my son's exile hath stopp'd her breath.
-    What further woe conspires against mine age?
-
-  Prince. Look, and thou shalt see.
-
-  Mon. O thou untaught! what manners is in this,
-    To press before thy father to a grave?
-
-  Prince. Seal up the mouth of outrage for a while,
-    Till we can clear these ambiguities
-    And know their spring, their head, their true descent;
-    And then will I be general of your woes
-    And lead you even to death. Meantime forbear,
-    And let mischance be slave to patience.
-    Bring forth the parties of suspicion.
-
-  Friar. I am the greatest, able to do least,
-    Yet most suspected, as the time and place
-    Doth make against me, of this direful murther;
-    And here I stand, both to impeach and purge
-    Myself condemned and myself excus'd.
-
-  Prince. Then say it once what thou dost know in this.
-
-  Friar. I will be brief, for my short date of breath
-    Is not so long as is a tedious tale.
-    Romeo, there dead, was husband to that Juliet;
-    And she, there dead, that Romeo's faithful wife.
-    I married them; and their stol'n marriage day
-    Was Tybalt's doomsday, whose untimely death
-    Banish'd the new-made bridegroom from this city;
-    For whom, and not for Tybalt, Juliet pin'd.
-    You, to remove that siege of grief from her,
-    Betroth'd and would have married her perforce
-    To County Paris. Then comes she to me
-    And with wild looks bid me devise some mean
-    To rid her from this second marriage,
-    Or in my cell there would she kill herself.
-    Then gave I her (so tutored by my art)
-    A sleeping potion; which so took effect
-    As I intended, for it wrought on her
-    The form of death. Meantime I writ to Romeo
-    That he should hither come as this dire night
-    To help to take her from her borrowed grave,
-    Being the time the potion's force should cease.
-    But he which bore my letter, Friar John,
-    Was stay'd by accident, and yesternight
-    Return'd my letter back. Then all alone
-    At the prefixed hour of her waking
-    Came I to take her from her kindred's vault;
-    Meaning to keep her closely at my cell
-    Till I conveniently could send to Romeo.
-    But when I came, some minute ere the time
-    Of her awaking, here untimely lay
-    The noble Paris and true Romeo dead.
-    She wakes; and I entreated her come forth
-    And bear this work of heaven with patience;
-    But then a noise did scare me from the tomb,
-    And she, too desperate, would not go with me,
-    But, as it seems, did violence on herself.
-    All this I know, and to the marriage
-    Her nurse is privy; and if aught in this
-    Miscarried by my fault, let my old life
-    Be sacrific'd, some hour before his time,
-    Unto the rigour of severest law.
-
-  Prince. We still have known thee for a holy man.
-    Where's Romeo's man? What can he say in this?
-
-  Bal. I brought my master news of Juliet's death;
-    And then in post he came from Mantua
-    To this same place, to this same monument.
-    This letter he early bid me give his father,
-    And threat'ned me with death, going in the vault,
-    If I departed not and left him there.
-
-  Prince. Give me the letter. I will look on it.
-    Where is the County's page that rais'd the watch?
-    Sirrah, what made your master in this place?
-
-  Boy. He came with flowers to strew his lady's grave;
-    And bid me stand aloof, and so I did.
-    Anon comes one with light to ope the tomb;
-    And by-and-by my master drew on him;
-    And then I ran away to call the watch.
-
-  Prince. This letter doth make good the friar's words,
-    Their course of love, the tidings of her death;
-    And here he writes that he did buy a poison
-    Of a poor pothecary, and therewithal
-    Came to this vault to die, and lie with Juliet.
-    Where be these enemies? Capulet, Montage,
-    See what a scourge is laid upon your hate,
-    That heaven finds means to kill your joys with love!
-    And I, for winking at you, discords too,
-    Have lost a brace of kinsmen. All are punish'd.
-
-  Cap. O brother Montague, give me thy hand.
-    This is my daughter's jointure, for no more
-    Can I demand.
-
-  Mon. But I can give thee more;
-    For I will raise her Statue in pure gold,
-    That whiles Verona by that name is known,
-    There shall no figure at such rate be set
-    As that of true and faithful Juliet.
-
-  Cap. As rich shall Romeo's by his lady's lie-
-    Poor sacrifices of our enmity!
-
-  Prince. A glooming peace this morning with it brings.
-    The sun for sorrow will not show his head.
-    Go hence, to have more talk of these sad things;
-    Some shall be pardon'd, and some punished;
-    For never was a story of more woe
-    Than this of Juliet and her Romeo.
-                                                   Exeunt omnes.

-Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
-Literary Archive Foundation
-
-Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
-spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
-increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
-freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
-array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
-($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
-status with the IRS.
-
-The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
-charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
-States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
-considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
-with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
-where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
-SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
-particular state visit http://pglaf.org
-
-While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
-have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
-against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
-approach us with offers to donate.
-
-International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
-any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
-outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
-
-Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
-methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
-ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
-To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate

-
-Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
-works.
-
-Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
-concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
-with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
-Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.
-
-
-Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
-editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
-unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
-keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.
-
-
-Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:
-
-     http://www.gutenberg.org
-
-This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
-including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
-Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
-subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

-
-Project Gutenberg Etexts are usually created from multiple editions,
-all of which are in the Public Domain in the United States, unless a
-copyright notice is included.  Therefore, we usually do NOT keep any
-of these books in compliance with any particular paper edition.
-
-
-We are now trying to release all our books one month in advance
-of the official release dates, leaving time for better editing.
-
-Please note:  neither this list nor its contents are final till
-midnight of the last day of the month of any such announcement.
-The official release date of all Project Gutenberg Etexts is at
-Midnight, Central Time, of the last day of the stated month.  A
-preliminary version may often be posted for suggestion, comment
-and editing by those who wish to do so.  To be sure you have an
-up to date first edition [xxxxx10x.xxx] please check file sizes
-in the first week of the next month.  Since our ftp program has
-a bug in it that scrambles the date [tried to fix and failed] a
-look at the file size will have to do, but we will try to see a
-new copy has at least one byte more or less.
-
-
-Information about Project Gutenberg (one page)
-
-We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The
-time it takes us, a rather conservative estimate, is fifty hours
-to get any etext selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright
-searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.  This
-projected audience is one hundred million readers.  If our value
-per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2
-million dollars per hour this year as we release thirty-six text
-files per month, or 432 more Etexts in 1999 for a total of 2000+
-If these reach just 10% of the computerized population, then the
-total should reach over 200 billion Etexts given away this year.
-
-The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away One Trillion Etext
-Files by December 31, 2001.  [10,000 x 100,000,000 = 1 Trillion]
-This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,
-which is only ~5% of the present number of computer users.
-
-At our revised rates of production, we will reach only one-third
-of that goal by the end of 2001, or about 3,333 Etexts unless we
-manage to get some real funding; currently our funding is mostly
-from Michael Hart's salary at Carnegie-Mellon University, and an
-assortment of sporadic gifts; this salary is only good for a few
-more years, so we are looking for something to replace it, as we
-don't want Project Gutenberg to be so dependent on one person.
-
-We need your donations more than ever!
-
-
-All donations should be made to "Project Gutenberg/CMU": and are
-tax deductible to the extent allowable by law.  (CMU = Carnegie-
-Mellon University).

-Why is this "Small Print!" statement here?  You know: lawyers.
-They tell us you might sue us if there is something wrong with
-your copy of this etext, even if you got it for free from
-someone other than us, and even if what's wrong is not our
-fault.  So, among other things, this "Small Print!" statement
-disclaims most of our liability to you.  It also tells you how
-you can distribute copies of this etext if you want to.
-
-*BEFORE!* YOU USE OR READ THIS ETEXT
-By using or reading any part of this PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
-etext, you indicate that you understand, agree to and accept

-medium (such as a disk), you must return it with your request.
-
-ABOUT PROJECT GUTENBERG-TM ETEXTS
-This PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm etext, like most PROJECT GUTENBERG-
-tm etexts, is a "public domain" work distributed by Professor
-Michael S. Hart through the Project Gutenberg Association at
-Carnegie-Mellon University (the "Project").  Among other
-things, this means that no one owns a United States copyright
-on or for this work, so the Project (and you!) can copy and
-distribute it in the United States without permission and
-without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules, set forth
-below, apply if you wish to copy and distribute this etext
-under the Project's "PROJECT GUTENBERG" trademark.
-
-To create these etexts, the Project expends considerable
-efforts to identify, transcribe and proofread public domain
-works.  Despite these efforts, the Project's etexts and any
-medium they may be on may contain "Defects".  Among other
-things, Defects may take the form of incomplete, inaccurate or
-corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
-intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged
-disk or other etext medium, a computer virus, or computer
-codes that damage or cannot be read by your equipment.
-
-LIMITED WARRANTY; DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES
-But for the "Right of Replacement or Refund" described below,
-[1] the Project (and any other party you may receive this
-etext from as a PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm etext) disclaims all
-liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including
-legal fees, and [2] YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE OR
-UNDER STRICT LIABILITY, OR FOR BREACH OF WARRANTY OR CONTRACT,
-INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE
-OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE
-POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
-
-If you discover a Defect in this etext within 90 days of
-receiving it, you can receive a refund of the money (if any)
-you paid for it by sending an explanatory note within that
-time to the person you received it from.  If you received it
-on a physical medium, you must return it with your note, and
-such person may choose to alternatively give you a replacement
-copy.  If you received it electronically, such person may
-choose to alternatively give you a second opportunity to
-receive it electronically.
-
-THIS ETEXT IS OTHERWISE PROVIDED TO YOU "AS-IS".  NO OTHER
-WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, ARE MADE TO YOU AS
-TO THE ETEXT OR ANY MEDIUM IT MAY BE ON, INCLUDING BUT NOT
-LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A
-PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

-the exclusion or limitation of consequential damages, so the
-above disclaimers and exclusions may not apply to you, and you
-may have other legal rights.
-
-INDEMNITY
-You will indemnify and hold the Project, its directors,
-officers, members and agents harmless from all liability, cost
-and expense, including legal fees, that arise directly or

-     requires that you do not remove, alter or modify the
-     etext or this "small print!" statement.  You may however,
-     if you wish, distribute this etext in machine readable
-     binary, compressed, mark-up, or proprietary form,
-     including any form resulting from conversion by word pro-
-     cessing or hypertext software, but only so long as
-     *EITHER*:
-
-     [*]  The etext, when displayed, is clearly readable, and
-          does *not* contain characters other than those
-          intended by the author of the work, although tilde
-          (~), asterisk (*) and underline (_) characters may
-          be used to convey punctuation intended by the
-          author, and additional characters may be used to
-          indicate hypertext links; OR
-
-     [*]  The etext may be readily converted by the reader at

-     payable to "Project Gutenberg Association/Carnegie-Mellon
-     University" within the 60 days following each
-     date you prepare (or were legally required to prepare)
-     your annual (or equivalent periodic) tax return.

-Executive Director's Notes:
-
-In addition to the notes below, and so you will *NOT* think all
-the spelling errors introduced by the printers of the time have
-been corrected, here are the first few lines of Hamlet, as they
-are presented herein:
-
-  Barnardo. Who's there?
-  Fran. Nay answer me: Stand & vnfold
-your selfe
-
-   Bar. Long liue the King
-
-***
-
-As I understand it, the printers often ran out of certain words
-or letters they had often packed into a "cliche". . .this is the
-original meaning of the term cliche. . .and thus, being unwilling
-to unpack the cliches, and thus you will see some substitutions
-that look very odd. . .such as the exchanges of u for v, v for u,
-above. . .and you may wonder why they did it this way, presuming
-Shakespeare did not actually write the play in this manner. . . .
-
-The answer is that they MAY have packed "liue" into a cliche at a
-time when they were out of "v"'s. . .possibly having used "vv" in
-place of some "w"'s, etc.  This was a common practice of the day,
-as print was still quite expensive, and they didn't want to spend
-more on a wider selection of characters than they had to.
-
-You will find a lot of these kinds of "errors" in this text, as I
-have mentioned in other times and places, many "scholars" have an
-extreme attachment to these errors, and many have accorded them a
-very high place in the "canon" of Shakespeare.  My father read an
-assortment of these made available to him by Cambridge University
-in England for several months in a glass room constructed for the
-purpose.  To the best of my knowledge he read ALL those available
-. . .in great detail. . .and determined from the various changes,
-that Shakespeare most likely did not write in nearly as many of a
-variety of errors we credit him for, even though he was in/famous
-for signing his name with several different spellings.
-
-So, please take this into account when reading the comments below
-made by our volunteer who prepared this file:  you may see errors
-that are "not" errors. . . .
-
-So. . .with this caveat. . .we have NOT changed the canon errors,
-here is the Project Gutenberg Etext of Shakespeare's The Tragedie 
-of Macbeth.

-
-Scanner's Notes: What this is and isn't.  This was taken from
-a copy of Shakespeare's first folio and it is as close as I can
-come in ASCII to the printed text.
-
-The elongated S's have been changed to small s's and the
-conjoined ae have been changed to ae.  I have left the spelling,
-punctuation, capitalization as close as possible to the
-printed text.  I have corrected some spelling mistakes (I have put
-together a spelling dictionary devised from the spellings of the
-Geneva Bible and Shakespeare's First Folio and have unified
-spellings according to this template), typo's and expanded
-abbreviations as I have come across them.  Everything within
-brackets [] is what I have added.  So if you don't like that
-you can delete everything within the brackets if you want a
-purer Shakespeare.
-
-Another thing that you should be aware of is that there are textual
-differences between various copies of the first folio.  So there may
-be differences (other than what I have mentioned above) between
-this and other first folio editions.  This is due to the printer's
-habit of setting the type and running off a number of copies and
-then proofing the printed copy and correcting the type and then
-continuing the printing run.  The proof run wasn't thrown away but
-incorporated into the printed copies.  This is just the way it is.
-The text I have used was a composite of more than 30 different
-First Folio editions' best pages.
-
-If you find any scanning errors, out and out typos, punctuation
-errors, or if you disagree with my spelling choices please feel
-free to email me those errors.  I wish to make this the best
-etext possible.  My email address for right now are haradda@aol.com
-and davidr@inconnect.com.  I hope that you enjoy this.

-   Rosse. God saue the King
-
-   King. Whence cam'st thou, worthy Thane?
-  Rosse. From Fiffe, great King,
-Where the Norweyan Banners flowt the Skie,
-And fanne our people cold.
-Norway himselfe, with terrible numbers,
-Assisted by that most disloyall Traytor,
-The Thane of Cawdor, began a dismall Conflict,
-Till that Bellona's Bridegroome, lapt in proofe,
-Confronted him with selfe-comparisons,
-Point against Point, rebellious Arme 'gainst Arme,
-Curbing his lauish spirit: and to conclude,
-The Victorie fell on vs
-
-   King. Great happinesse
-
-   Rosse. That now Sweno, the Norwayes King,
-Craues composition:
-Nor would we deigne him buriall of his men,
-Till he disbursed, at Saint Colmes ynch,
-Ten thousand Dollars, to our generall vse
-
-   King. No more that Thane of Cawdor shall deceiue
-Our Bosome interest: Goe pronounce his present death,
-And with his former Title greet Macbeth
-
-   Rosse. Ile see it done
-
-   King. What he hath lost, Noble Macbeth hath wonne.
-
-Exeunt.
-
-
-Scena Tertia.
-
-Thunder. Enter the three Witches.
-
-  1. Where hast thou beene, Sister?
-  2. Killing Swine
-
-   3. Sister, where thou?
-  1. A Saylors Wife had Chestnuts in her Lappe,
-And mouncht, & mouncht, and mouncht:
-Giue me, quoth I.
-Aroynt thee, Witch, the rumpe-fed Ronyon cryes.
-Her Husband's to Aleppo gone, Master o'th' Tiger:
-But in a Syue Ile thither sayle,
-And like a Rat without a tayle,
-Ile doe, Ile doe, and Ile doe
-
-   2. Ile giue thee a Winde
-
-   1. Th'art kinde
-
-   3. And I another
-
-   1. I my selfe haue all the other,
-And the very Ports they blow,
-All the Quarters that they know,
-I'th' Ship-mans Card.
-Ile dreyne him drie as Hay:
-Sleepe shall neyther Night nor Day
-Hang vpon his Pent-house Lid:
-He shall liue a man forbid:
-Wearie Seu'nights, nine times nine,
-Shall he dwindle, peake, and pine:
-Though his Barke cannot be lost,
-Yet it shall be Tempest-tost.
-Looke what I haue
-
-   2. Shew me, shew me
-
-   1. Here I haue a Pilots Thumbe,
-Wrackt, as homeward he did come.
-
-Drum within.
-
-  3. A Drumme, a Drumme:
-Macbeth doth come
-
-   All. The weyward Sisters, hand in hand,
-Posters of the Sea and Land,
-Thus doe goe, about, about,
-Thrice to thine, and thrice to mine,
-And thrice againe, to make vp nine.
-Peace, the Charme's wound vp.
-Enter Macbeth and Banquo.
-
-  Macb. So foule and faire a day I haue not seene
-
-   Banquo. How farre is't call'd to Soris? What are these,
-So wither'd, and so wilde in their attyre,
-That looke not like th' Inhabitants o'th' Earth,
-And yet are on't? Liue you, or are you aught
-That man may question? you seeme to vnderstand me,
-By each at once her choppie finger laying
-Vpon her skinnie Lips: you should be Women,
-And yet your Beards forbid me to interprete
-That you are so
-
-   Mac. Speake if you can: what are you?
-  1. All haile Macbeth, haile to thee Thane of Glamis
-
-   2. All haile Macbeth, haile to thee Thane of Cawdor
-
-   3. All haile Macbeth, that shalt be King hereafter
-
-   Banq. Good Sir, why doe you start, and seeme to feare
-Things that doe sound so faire? i'th' name of truth
-Are ye fantasticall, or that indeed
-Which outwardly ye shew? My Noble Partner
-You greet with present Grace, and great prediction
-Of Noble hauing, and of Royall hope,
-That he seemes wrapt withall: to me you speake not.
-If you can looke into the Seedes of Time,
-And say, which Graine will grow, and which will not,
-Speake then to me, who neyther begge, nor feare
-Your fauors, nor your hate
-
-   1. Hayle
-
-   2. Hayle
-
-   3. Hayle
-
-   1. Lesser than Macbeth, and greater
-
-   2. Not so happy, yet much happyer
-
-   3. Thou shalt get Kings, though thou be none:
-So all haile Macbeth, and Banquo
-
-   1. Banquo, and Macbeth, all haile
-
-   Macb. Stay you imperfect Speakers, tell me more:
-By Sinells death, I know I am Thane of Glamis,
-But how, of Cawdor? the Thane of Cawdor liues
-A prosperous Gentleman: And to be King,
-Stands not within the prospect of beleefe,
-No more then to be Cawdor. Say from whence
-You owe this strange Intelligence, or why
-Vpon this blasted Heath you stop our way
-With such Prophetique greeting?
-Speake, I charge you.
-
-Witches vanish.
-
-  Banq. The Earth hath bubbles, as the Water ha's,
-And these are of them: whither are they vanish'd?
-  Macb. Into the Ayre: and what seem'd corporall,
-Melted, as breath into the Winde.
-Would they had stay'd
-
-   Banq. Were such things here, as we doe speake about?
-Or haue we eaten on the insane Root,
-That takes the Reason Prisoner?
-  Macb. Your Children shall be Kings
-
-   Banq. You shall be King
-
-   Macb. And Thane of Cawdor too: went it not so?
-  Banq. Toth' selfe-same tune and words: who's here?
-Enter Rosse and Angus.
-
-  Rosse. The King hath happily receiu'd, Macbeth,
-The newes of thy successe: and when he reades
-Thy personall Venture in the Rebels sight,
-His Wonders and his Prayses doe contend,
-Which should be thine, or his: silenc'd with that,
-In viewing o're the rest o'th' selfe-same day,
-He findes thee in the stout Norweyan Rankes,
-Nothing afeard of what thy selfe didst make
-Strange Images of death, as thick as Tale
-Can post with post, and euery one did beare
-Thy prayses in his Kingdomes great defence,
-And powr'd them downe before him
-
-   Ang. Wee are sent,
-To giue thee from our Royall Master thanks,
-Onely to harrold thee into his sight,
-Not pay thee
-
-   Rosse. And for an earnest of a greater Honor,
-He bad me, from him, call thee Thane of Cawdor:
-In which addition, haile most worthy Thane,
-For it is thine
-
-   Banq. What, can the Deuill speake true?
-  Macb. The Thane of Cawdor liues:
-Why doe you dresse me in borrowed Robes?
-  Ang. Who was the Thane, liues yet,
-But vnder heauie Iudgement beares that Life,
-Which he deserues to loose.
-Whether he was combin'd with those of Norway,
-Or did lyne the Rebell with hidden helpe,
-And vantage; or that with both he labour'd
-In his Countreyes wracke, I know not:
-But Treasons Capitall, confess'd, and prou'd,
-Haue ouerthrowne him
-
-   Macb. Glamys, and Thane of Cawdor:
-The greatest is behinde. Thankes for your paines.
-Doe you not hope your Children shall be Kings,
-When those that gaue the Thane of Cawdor to me,
-Promis'd no lesse to them
-
-   Banq. That trusted home,
-Might yet enkindle you vnto the Crowne,
-Besides the Thane of Cawdor. But 'tis strange:
-And oftentimes, to winne vs to our harme,
-The Instruments of Darknesse tell vs Truths,
-Winne vs with honest Trifles, to betray's
-In deepest consequence.
-Cousins, a word, I pray you
-
-   Macb. Two Truths are told,
-As happy Prologues to the swelling Act
-Of the Imperiall Theame. I thanke you Gentlemen:
-This supernaturall solliciting
-Cannot be ill; cannot be good.
-If ill? why hath it giuen me earnest of successe,
-Commencing in a Truth? I am Thane of Cawdor.
-If good? why doe I yeeld to that suggestion,
-Whose horrid Image doth vnfixe my Heire,
-And make my seated Heart knock at my Ribbes,
-Against the vse of Nature? Present Feares
-Are lesse then horrible Imaginings:
-My Thought, whose Murther yet is but fantasticall,
-Shakes so my single state of Man,
-That Function is smother'd in surmise,
-And nothing is, but what is not
-
-   Banq. Looke how our Partner's rapt
-
-   Macb. If Chance will haue me King,
-Why Chance may Crowne me,
-Without my stirre
-
-   Banq. New Honors come vpon him
-Like our strange Garments, cleaue not to their mould,
-But with the aid of vse
-
-   Macb. Come what come may,
-Time, and the Houre, runs through the roughest Day
-
-   Banq. Worthy Macbeth, wee stay vpon your leysure
-
-   Macb. Giue me your fauour:
-My dull Braine was wrought with things forgotten.
-Kinde Gentlemen, your paines are registred,
-Where euery day I turne the Leafe,
-To reade them.
-Let vs toward the King: thinke vpon
-What hath chanc'd: and at more time,
-The Interim hauing weigh'd it, let vs speake
-Our free Hearts each to other
-
-   Banq. Very gladly
-
-   Macb. Till then enough:
-Come friends.
-
-Exeunt.
-
-
-Scena Quarta.
-
-Flourish. Enter King, Lenox, Malcolme, Donalbaine, and
-Attendants.
-
-  King. Is execution done on Cawdor?
-Or not those in Commission yet return'd?
-  Mal. My Liege, they are not yet come back.
-But I haue spoke with one that saw him die:
-Who did report, that very frankly hee
-Confess'd his Treasons, implor'd your Highnesse Pardon,
-And set forth a deepe Repentance:
-Nothing in his Life became him,
-Like the leauing it. Hee dy'de,
-As one that had beene studied in his death,
-To throw away the dearest thing he ow'd,
-As 'twere a carelesse Trifle
-
-   King. There's no Art,
-To finde the Mindes construction in the Face.
-He was a Gentleman, on whom I built
-An absolute Trust.
-Enter Macbeth, Banquo, Rosse, and Angus.
-
-O worthyest Cousin,
-The sinne of my Ingratitude euen now
-Was heauie on me. Thou art so farre before,
-That swiftest Wing of Recompence is slow,
-To ouertake thee. Would thou hadst lesse deseru'd,
-That the proportion both of thanks, and payment,
-Might haue beene mine: onely I haue left to say,
-More is thy due, then more then all can pay
-
-   Macb. The seruice, and the loyaltie I owe,
-In doing it, payes it selfe.
-Your Highnesse part, is to receiue our Duties:
-And our Duties are to your Throne, and State,
-Children, and Seruants; which doe but what they should,
-By doing euery thing safe toward your Loue
-And Honor
-
-   King. Welcome hither:
-I haue begun to plant thee, and will labour
-To make thee full of growing. Noble Banquo,
-That hast no lesse deseru'd, nor must be knowne
-No lesse to haue done so: Let me enfold thee,
-And hold thee to my Heart
-
-   Banq. There if I grow,
-The Haruest is your owne
-
-   King. My plenteous Ioyes,
-Wanton in fulnesse, seeke to hide themselues
-In drops of sorrow. Sonnes, Kinsmen, Thanes,
-And you whose places are the nearest, know,
-We will establish our Estate vpon
-Our eldest, Malcolme, whom we name hereafter,
-The Prince of Cumberland: which Honor must
-Not vnaccompanied, inuest him onely,
-But signes of Noblenesse, like Starres, shall shine
-On all deseruers. From hence to Envernes,
-And binde vs further to you
-
-   Macb. The Rest is Labor, which is not vs'd for you:
-Ile be my selfe the Herbenger, and make ioyfull
-The hearing of my Wife, with your approach:
-So humbly take my leaue
-
-   King. My worthy Cawdor
-
-   Macb. The Prince of Cumberland: that is a step,
-On which I must fall downe, or else o're-leape,
-For in my way it lyes. Starres hide your fires,
-Let not Light see my black and deepe desires:
-The Eye winke at the Hand: yet let that bee,
-Which the Eye feares, when it is done to see.
-Enter.
-
-  King. True worthy Banquo: he is full so valiant,
-And in his commendations, I am fed:
-It is a Banquet to me. Let's after him,
-Whose care is gone before, to bid vs welcome:
-It is a peerelesse Kinsman.
-
-Flourish. Exeunt.
-
-
-Scena Quinta.
-
-Enter Macbeths Wife alone with a Letter.
-
-  Lady. They met me in the day of successe: and I haue
-learn'd by the perfect'st report, they haue more in them, then
-mortall knowledge. When I burnt in desire to question them
-further, they made themselues Ayre, into which they vanish'd.
-Whiles I stood rapt in the wonder of it, came Missiues from
-the King, who all-hail'd me Thane of Cawdor, by which Title
-before, these weyward Sisters saluted me, and referr'd me to
-the comming on of time, with haile King that shalt be. This
-haue I thought good to deliuer thee (my dearest Partner of
-Greatnesse) that thou might'st not loose the dues of reioycing
-by being ignorant of what Greatnesse is promis'd thee. Lay
-it to thy heart and farewell.
-Glamys thou art, and Cawdor, and shalt be
-What thou art promis'd: yet doe I feare thy Nature,
-It is too full o'th' Milke of humane kindnesse,
-To catch the neerest way. Thou would'st be great,
-Art not without Ambition, but without
-The illnesse should attend it. What thou would'st highly,
-That would'st thou holily: would'st not play false,
-And yet would'st wrongly winne.
-Thould'st haue, great Glamys, that which cryes,
-Thus thou must doe, if thou haue it;
-And that which rather thou do'st feare to doe,
-Then wishest should be vndone. High thee hither,
-That I may powre my Spirits in thine Eare,
-And chastise with the valour of my Tongue
-All that impeides thee from the Golden Round,
-Which Fate and Metaphysicall ayde doth seeme
-To haue thee crown'd withall.
-Enter Messenger.
-
-What is your tidings?
-  Mess. The King comes here to Night
-
-   Lady. Thou'rt mad to say it.
-Is not thy Master with him? who, wer't so,
-Would haue inform'd for preparation
-
-   Mess. So please you, it is true: our Thane is comming:
-One of my fellowes had the speed of him;
-Who almost dead for breath, had scarcely more
-Then would make vp his Message
-
-   Lady. Giue him tending,
-He brings great newes,
-
-Exit Messenger.
-
-The Rauen himselfe is hoarse,
-That croakes the fatall entrance of Duncan
-Vnder my Battlements. Come you Spirits,
-That tend on mortall thoughts, vnsex me here,
-And fill me from the Crowne to the Toe, top-full
-Of direst Crueltie: make thick my blood,
-Stop vp th' accesse, and passage to Remorse,
-That no compunctious visitings of Nature
-Shake my fell purpose, nor keepe peace betweene
-Th' effect, and hit. Come to my Womans Brests,
-And take my Milke for Gall, you murth'ring Ministers,
-Where-euer, in your sightlesse substances,
-You wait on Natures Mischiefe. Come thick Night,
-And pall thee in the dunnest smoake of Hell,
-
-That my keene Knife see not the Wound it makes,
-Nor Heauen peepe through the Blanket of the darke,
-To cry, hold, hold.
-Enter Macbeth.
-
-Great Glamys, worthy Cawdor,
-Greater then both, by the all-haile hereafter,
-Thy Letters haue transported me beyond
-This ignorant present, and I feele now
-The future in the instant
-
-   Macb. My dearest Loue,
-Duncan comes here to Night
-
-   Lady. And when goes hence?
-  Macb. To morrow, as he purposes
-
-   Lady. O neuer,
-Shall Sunne that Morrow see.
-Your Face, my Thane, is as a Booke, where men
-May reade strange matters, to beguile the time.
-Looke like the time, beare welcome in your Eye,
-Your Hand, your Tongue: looke like th' innocent flower,
-But be the Serpent vnder't. He that's comming,
-Must be prouided for: and you shall put
-This Nights great Businesse into my dispatch,
-Which shall to all our Nights, and Dayes to come,
-Giue solely soueraigne sway, and Masterdome
-
-   Macb. We will speake further,
-  Lady. Onely looke vp cleare:
-To alter fauor, euer is to feare:
-Leaue all the rest to me.
-
-Exeunt.
-
-
-Scena Sexta.
-
-Hoboyes, and Torches. Enter King, Malcolme, Donalbaine,
-Banquo, Lenox,
-Macduff, Rosse, Angus, and Attendants.
-
-  King. This Castle hath a pleasant seat,
-The ayre nimbly and sweetly recommends it selfe
-Vnto our gentle sences
-
-   Banq. This Guest of Summer,
-The Temple-haunting Barlet does approue,
-By his loued Mansonry, that the Heauens breath
-Smells wooingly here: no Iutty frieze,
-Buttrice, nor Coigne of Vantage, but this Bird
-Hath made his pendant Bed, and procreant Cradle,
-Where they must breed, and haunt: I haue obseru'd
-The ayre is delicate.
-Enter Lady.
-
-  King. See, see our honor'd Hostesse:
-The Loue that followes vs, sometime is our trouble,
-Which still we thanke as Loue. Herein I teach you,
-How you shall bid God-eyld vs for your paines,
-And thanke vs for your trouble
-
-   Lady. All our seruice,
-In euery point twice done, and then done double,
-Were poore, and single Businesse, to contend
-Against those Honors deepe, and broad,
-Wherewith your Maiestie loades our House:
-For those of old, and the late Dignities,
-Heap'd vp to them, we rest your Ermites
-
-   King. Where's the Thane of Cawdor?
-We courst him at the heeles, and had a purpose
-To be his Purueyor: But he rides well,
-And his great Loue (sharpe as his Spurre) hath holp him
-To his home before vs: Faire and Noble Hostesse
-We are your guest to night
-
-   La. Your Seruants euer,
-Haue theirs, themselues, and what is theirs in compt,
-To make their Audit at your Highnesse pleasure,
-Still to returne your owne
-
-   King. Giue me your hand:
-Conduct me to mine Host we loue him highly,
-And shall continue, our Graces towards him.
-By your leaue Hostesse.
-
-Exeunt.
-
-Scena Septima.
-
-Hoboyes. Torches. Enter a Sewer, and diuers Seruants with Dishes
-and
-Seruice ouer the Stage. Then enter Macbeth
-
-   Macb. If it were done, when 'tis done, then 'twer well,
-It were done quickly: If th' Assassination
-Could trammell vp the Consequence, and catch
-With his surcease, Successe: that but this blow
-Might be the be all, and the end all. Heere,
-But heere, vpon this Banke and Schoole of time,
-Wee'ld iumpe the life to come. But in these Cases,
-We still haue iudgement heere, that we but teach
-Bloody Instructions, which being taught, returne
-To plague th' Inuenter, this euen-handed Iustice
-Commends th' Ingredience of our poyson'd Challice
-To our owne lips. Hee's heere in double trust;
-First, as I am his Kinsman, and his Subiect,
-Strong both against the Deed: Then, as his Host,
-Who should against his Murtherer shut the doore,
-Not beare the knife my selfe. Besides, this Duncane
-Hath borne his Faculties so meeke; hath bin
-So cleere in his great Office, that his Vertues
-Will pleade like Angels, Trumpet-tongu'd against
-The deepe damnation of his taking off:
-And Pitty, like a naked New-borne-Babe,
-Striding the blast, or Heauens Cherubin, hors'd
-Vpon the sightlesse Curriors of the Ayre,
-Shall blow the horrid deed in euery eye,
-That teares shall drowne the winde. I haue no Spurre
-To pricke the sides of my intent, but onely
-Vaulting Ambition, which ore-leapes it selfe,
-And falles on th' other.
-Enter Lady.
-
-How now? What Newes?
-  La. He has almost supt: why haue you left the chamber?
-  Mac. Hath he ask'd for me?
-  La. Know you not, he ha's?
-  Mac. We will proceed no further in this Businesse:
-He hath Honour'd me of late, and I haue bought
-Golden Opinions from all sorts of people,
-Which would be worne now in their newest glosse,
-Not cast aside so soone
-
-   La. Was the hope drunke,
-Wherein you drest your selfe? Hath it slept since?
-And wakes it now to looke so greene, and pale,
-At what it did so freely? From this time,
-Such I account thy loue. Art thou affear'd
-To be the same in thine owne Act, and Valour,
-As thou art in desire? Would'st thou haue that
-Which thou esteem'st the Ornament of Life,
-And liue a Coward in thine owne Esteeme?
-Letting I dare not, wait vpon I would,
-Like the poore Cat i'th' Addage
-
-   Macb. Prythee peace:
-I dare do all that may become a man,
-Who dares do more, is none
-
-   La. What Beast was't then
-That made you breake this enterprize to me?
-When you durst do it, then you were a man:
-And to be more then what you were, you would
-Be so much more the man. Nor time, nor place
-Did then adhere, and yet you would make both:
-They haue made themselues, and that their fitnesse now
-Do's vnmake you. I haue giuen Sucke, and know
-How tender 'tis to loue the Babe that milkes me,
-I would, while it was smyling in my Face,
-Haue pluckt my Nipple from his Bonelesse Gummes,
-And dasht the Braines out, had I so sworne
-As you haue done to this
-
-   Macb. If we should faile?
-  Lady. We faile?
-But screw your courage to the sticking place,
-And wee'le not fayle: when Duncan is asleepe,
-(Whereto the rather shall his dayes hard Iourney
-Soundly inuite him) his two Chamberlaines
-Will I with Wine, and Wassell, so conuince,
-That Memorie, the Warder of the Braine,
-Shall be a Fume, and the Receit of Reason
-A Lymbeck onely: when in Swinish sleepe,
-Their drenched Natures lyes as in a Death,
-What cannot you and I performe vpon
-Th' vnguarded Duncan? What not put vpon
-His spungie Officers? who shall beare the guilt
-Of our great quell
-
-   Macb. Bring forth Men-Children onely:
-For thy vndaunted Mettle should compose
-Nothing but Males. Will it not be receiu'd,
-When we haue mark'd with blood those sleepie two
-Of his owne Chamber, and vs'd their very Daggers,
-That they haue don't?
-  Lady. Who dares receiue it other,
-As we shall make our Griefes and Clamor rore,
-Vpon his Death?
-  Macb. I am settled, and bend vp
-Each corporall Agent to this terrible Feat.
-Away, and mock the time with fairest show,
-False Face must hide what the false Heart doth know.
-
-Exeunt.
-
-
-Actus Secundus. Scena Prima.
-
-Enter Banquo, and Fleance, with a Torch before him.
-
-  Banq. How goes the Night, Boy?
-  Fleance. The Moone is downe: I haue not heard the
-Clock
-
-   Banq. And she goes downe at Twelue
-
-   Fleance. I take't, 'tis later, Sir
-
-   Banq. Hold, take my Sword:
-There's Husbandry in Heauen,
-Their Candles are all out: take thee that too.
-A heauie Summons lyes like Lead vpon me,
-And yet I would not sleepe:
-Mercifull Powers, restraine in me the cursed thoughts
-That Nature giues way to in repose.
-Enter Macbeth, and a Seruant with a Torch.
-
-Giue me my Sword: who's there?
-  Macb. A Friend
-
-   Banq. What Sir, not yet at rest? the King's a bed.
-He hath beene in vnusuall Pleasure,
-And sent forth great Largesse to your Offices.
-This Diamond he greetes your Wife withall,
-By the name of most kind Hostesse,
-And shut vp in measurelesse content
-
-   Mac. Being vnprepar'd,
-Our will became the seruant to defect,
-Which else should free haue wrought
-
-   Banq. All's well.
-I dreamt last Night of the three weyward Sisters:
-To you they haue shew'd some truth
-
-   Macb. I thinke not of them:
-Yet when we can entreat an houre to serue,
-We would spend it in some words vpon that Businesse,
-If you would graunt the time
-
-   Banq. At your kind'st leysure
-
-   Macb. If you shall cleaue to my consent,
-When 'tis, it shall make Honor for you
-
-   Banq. So I lose none,
-In seeking to augment it, but still keepe
-My Bosome franchis'd, and Allegeance cleare,
-I shall be counsail'd
-
-   Macb. Good repose the while
-
-   Banq. Thankes Sir: the like to you.
-
-Exit Banquo.
-
-  Macb. Goe bid thy Mistresse, when my drinke is ready,
-She strike vpon the Bell. Get thee to bed.
-Enter.
-
-Is this a Dagger, which I see before me,
-The Handle toward my Hand? Come, let me clutch thee:
-I haue thee not, and yet I see thee still.
-Art thou not fatall Vision, sensible
-To feeling, as to sight? or art thou but
-A Dagger of the Minde, a false Creation,
-Proceeding from the heat-oppressed Braine?
-I see thee yet, in forme as palpable,
-As this which now I draw.
-Thou marshall'st me the way that I was going,
-And such an Instrument I was to vse.
-Mine Eyes are made the fooles o'th' other Sences,
-Or else worth all the rest: I see thee still;
-And on thy Blade, and Dudgeon, Gouts of Blood,
-Which was not so before. There's no such thing:
-It is the bloody Businesse, which informes
-Thus to mine Eyes. Now o're the one halfe World
-Nature seemes dead, and wicked Dreames abuse
-The Curtain'd sleepe: Witchcraft celebrates
-Pale Heccats Offrings: and wither'd Murther,
-Alarum'd by his Centinell, the Wolfe,
-Whose howle's his Watch, thus with his stealthy pace,
-With Tarquins rauishing sides, towards his designe
-Moues like a Ghost. Thou sowre and firme-set Earth
-Heare not my steps, which they may walke, for feare
-Thy very stones prate of my where-about,
-And take the present horror from the time,
-Which now sutes with it. Whiles I threat, he liues:
-Words to the heat of deedes too cold breath giues.
-
-A Bell rings.
-
-I goe, and it is done: the Bell inuites me.
-Heare it not, Duncan, for it is a Knell,
-That summons thee to Heauen, or to Hell.
-Enter.
-
-
-Scena Secunda.
-
-Enter Lady.
-
-  La. That which hath made the[m] drunk, hath made me bold:
-What hath quench'd them, hath giuen me fire.
-Hearke, peace: it was the Owle that shriek'd,
-The fatall Bell-man, which giues the stern'st good-night.
-He is about it, the Doores are open:
-And the surfeted Groomes doe mock their charge
-With Snores. I haue drugg'd their Possets,
-That Death and Nature doe contend about them,
-Whether they liue, or dye.
-Enter Macbeth.
-
-  Macb. Who's there? what hoa?
-  Lady. Alack, I am afraid they haue awak'd,
-And 'tis not done: th' attempt, and not the deed,
-Confounds vs: hearke: I lay'd their Daggers ready,
-He could not misse 'em. Had he not resembled
-My Father as he slept, I had don't.
-My Husband?
-  Macb. I haue done the deed:
-Didst thou not heare a noyse?
-  Lady. I heard the Owle schreame, and the Crickets cry.
-Did not you speake?
-  Macb. When?
-  Lady. Now
-
-   Macb. As I descended?
-  Lady. I
-
-   Macb. Hearke, who lyes i'th' second Chamber?
-  Lady. Donalbaine
-
-   Mac. This is a sorry sight
-
-   Lady. A foolish thought, to say a sorry sight
-
-   Macb. There's one did laugh in's sleepe,
-And one cry'd Murther, that they did wake each other:
-I stood, and heard them: But they did say their Prayers,
-And addrest them againe to sleepe
-
-   Lady. There are two lodg'd together
-
-   Macb. One cry'd God blesse vs, and Amen the other,
-As they had seene me with these Hangmans hands:
-Listning their feare, I could not say Amen,
-When they did say God blesse vs
-
-   Lady. Consider it not so deepely
-
-   Mac. But wherefore could not I pronounce Amen?
-I had most need of Blessing, and Amen stuck in my throat
-
-   Lady. These deeds must not be thought
-After these wayes: so, it will make vs mad
-
-   Macb. Me thought I heard a voyce cry, Sleep no more:
-Macbeth does murther Sleepe, the innocent Sleepe,
-Sleepe that knits vp the rauel'd Sleeue of Care,
-The death of each dayes Life, sore Labors Bath,
-Balme of hurt Mindes, great Natures second Course,
-Chiefe nourisher in Life's Feast
-
-   Lady. What doe you meane?
-  Macb. Still it cry'd, Sleepe no more to all the House:
-Glamis hath murther'd Sleepe, and therefore Cawdor
-Shall sleepe no more: Macbeth shall sleepe no more
-
-   Lady. Who was it, that thus cry'd? why worthy Thane,
-You doe vnbend your Noble strength, to thinke
-So braine-sickly of things: Goe get some Water,
-And wash this filthie Witnesse from your Hand.
-Why did you bring these Daggers from the place?
-They must lye there: goe carry them, and smeare
-The sleepie Groomes with blood
-
-   Macb. Ile goe no more:
-I am afraid, to thinke what I haue done:
-Looke on't againe, I dare not
-
-   Lady. Infirme of purpose:
-Giue me the Daggers: the sleeping, and the dead,
-Are but as Pictures: 'tis the Eye of Childhood,
-That feares a painted Deuill. If he doe bleed,
-Ile guild the Faces of the Groomes withall,
-For it must seeme their Guilt.
-Enter.
-
-Knocke within.
-
-  Macb. Whence is that knocking?
-How is't with me, when euery noyse appalls me?
-What Hands are here? hah: they pluck out mine Eyes.
-Will all great Neptunes Ocean wash this blood
-Cleane from my Hand? no: this my Hand will rather
-The multitudinous Seas incarnardine,
-Making the Greene one, Red.
-Enter Lady.
-
-  Lady. My Hands are of your colour: but I shame
-To weare a Heart so white.
-
-Knocke.
-
-I heare a knocking at the South entry:
-Retyre we to our Chamber:
-A little Water cleares vs of this deed.
-How easie is it then? your Constancie
-Hath left you vnattended.
-
-Knocke.
-
-Hearke, more knocking.
-Get on your Night-Gowne, least occasion call vs,
-And shew vs to be Watchers: be not lost
-So poorely in your thoughts
-
-   Macb. To know my deed,
-
-Knocke.
-
-'Twere best not know my selfe.
-Wake Duncan with thy knocking:
-I would thou could'st.
-
-Exeunt.
-
-
-Scena Tertia.
-
-Enter a Porter. Knocking within.
-
-  Porter. Here's a knocking indeede: if a man were
-Porter of Hell Gate, hee should haue old turning the
-Key.
-
-Knock.
-
-Knock, Knock, Knock. Who's there
-i'th' name of Belzebub? Here's a Farmer, that hang'd
-himselfe on th' expectation of Plentie: Come in time, haue
-Napkins enow about you, here you'le sweat for't.
-
-Knock.
-
-Knock, knock. Who's there in th' other Deuils Name?
-Faith here's an Equiuocator, that could sweare in both
-the Scales against eyther Scale, who committed Treason
-enough for Gods sake, yet could not equiuocate to Heauen:
-oh come in, Equiuocator.
-
-Knock.
-
-Knock, Knock, Knock. Who's there? 'Faith here's an English
-Taylor come hither, for stealing out of a French Hose:
-Come in Taylor, here you may rost your Goose.
-Knock.
-
-Knock, Knock. Neuer at quiet: What are you? but this
-place is too cold for Hell. Ile Deuill-Porter it no further:
-I had thought to haue let in some of all Professions, that
-goe the Primrose way to th' euerlasting Bonfire.
-
-Knock.
-
-Anon, anon, I pray you remember the Porter.
-Enter Macduff, and Lenox.
-
-  Macd. Was it so late, friend, ere you went to Bed,
-That you doe lye so late?
-  Port. Faith Sir, we were carowsing till the second Cock:
-And Drinke, Sir, is a great prouoker of three things
-
-   Macd. What three things does Drinke especially
-prouoke?
-  Port. Marry, Sir, Nose-painting, Sleepe, and Vrine.
-Lecherie, Sir, it prouokes, and vnprouokes: it prouokes
-the desire, but it takes away the performance. Therefore
-much Drinke may be said to be an Equiuocator with Lecherie:
-it makes him, and it marres him; it sets him on,
-and it takes him off; it perswades him, and dis-heartens
-him; makes him stand too, and not stand too: in conclusion,
-equiuocates him in a sleepe, and giuing him the Lye,
-leaues him
-
-   Macd. I beleeue, Drinke gaue thee the Lye last Night
-
-   Port. That it did, Sir, i'the very Throat on me: but I
-requited him for his Lye, and (I thinke) being too strong
-for him, though he tooke vp my Legges sometime, yet I
-made a Shift to cast him.
-Enter Macbeth.
-
-  Macd. Is thy Master stirring?
-Our knocking ha's awak'd him: here he comes
-
-   Lenox. Good morrow, Noble Sir
-
-   Macb. Good morrow both
-
-   Macd. Is the King stirring, worthy Thane?
-  Macb. Not yet
-
-   Macd. He did command me to call timely on him,
-I haue almost slipt the houre
-
-   Macb. Ile bring you to him
-
-   Macd. I know this is a ioyfull trouble to you:
-But yet 'tis one
-
-   Macb. The labour we delight in, Physicks paine:
-This is the Doore
-
-   Macd. Ile make so bold to call, for 'tis my limitted
-seruice.
-
-Exit Macduffe.
-
-  Lenox. Goes the King hence to day?
-  Macb. He does: he did appoint so
-
-   Lenox. The Night ha's been vnruly:
-Where we lay, our Chimneys were blowne downe,
-And (as they say) lamentings heard i'th' Ayre;
-Strange Schreemes of Death,
-And Prophecying, with Accents terrible,
-Of dyre Combustion, and confus'd Euents,
-New hatch'd toth' wofull time.
-The obscure Bird clamor'd the liue-long Night.
-Some say, the Earth was Feuorous,
-And did shake
-
-   Macb. 'Twas a rough Night
-
-   Lenox. My young remembrance cannot paralell
-A fellow to it.
-Enter Macduff.
-
-  Macd. O horror, horror, horror,
-Tongue nor Heart cannot conceiue, nor name thee
-
-   Macb. and Lenox. What's the matter?
-  Macd. Confusion now hath made his Master-peece:
-Most sacrilegious Murther hath broke ope
-The Lords anoynted Temple, and stole thence
-The Life o'th' Building
-
-   Macb. What is't you say, the Life?
-  Lenox. Meane you his Maiestie?
-  Macd. Approch the Chamber, and destroy your sight
-With a new Gorgon. Doe not bid me speake:
-See, and then speake your selues: awake, awake,
-
-Exeunt. Macbeth and Lenox.
-
-Ring the Alarum Bell: Murther, and Treason,
-Banquo, and Donalbaine: Malcolme awake,
-Shake off this Downey sleepe, Deaths counterfeit,
-And looke on Death it selfe: vp, vp, and see
-The great Doomes Image: Malcolme, Banquo,
-As from your Graues rise vp, and walke like Sprights,
-To countenance this horror. Ring the Bell.
-
-Bell rings. Enter Lady.
-
-  Lady. What's the Businesse?
-That such a hideous Trumpet calls to parley
-The sleepers of the House? speake, speake
-
-   Macd. O gentle Lady,
-'Tis not for you to heare what I can speake:
-The repetition in a Womans eare,
-Would murther as it fell.
-Enter Banquo.
-
-O Banquo, Banquo, Our Royall Master's murther'd
-
-   Lady. Woe, alas:
-What, in our House?
-  Ban. Too cruell, any where.
-Deare Duff, I prythee contradict thy selfe,
-And say, it is not so.
-Enter Macbeth, Lenox, and Rosse.
-
-  Macb. Had I but dy'd an houre before this chance,
-I had liu'd a blessed time: for from this instant,
-There's nothing serious in Mortalitie:
-All is but Toyes: Renowne and Grace is dead,
-The Wine of Life is drawne, and the meere Lees
-Is left this Vault, to brag of.
-Enter Malcolme and Donalbaine.
-
-  Donal. What is amisse?
-  Macb. You are, and doe not know't:
-The Spring, the Head, the Fountaine of your Blood
-Is stopt, the very Source of it is stopt
-
-   Macd. Your Royall Father's murther'd
-
-   Mal. Oh, by whom?
-  Lenox. Those of his Chamber, as it seem'd, had don't:
-Their Hands and Faces were all badg'd with blood,
-So were their Daggers, which vnwip'd, we found
-Vpon their Pillowes: they star'd, and were distracted,
-No mans Life was to be trusted with them
-
-   Macb. O, yet I doe repent me of my furie,
-That I did kill them
-
-   Macd. Wherefore did you so?
-  Macb. Who can be wise, amaz'd, temp'rate, & furious,
-Loyall, and Neutrall, in a moment? No man:
-Th' expedition of my violent Loue
-Out-run the pawser, Reason. Here lay Duncan,
-His Siluer skinne, lac'd with His Golden Blood,
-And his gash'd Stabs, look'd like a Breach in Nature,
-For Ruines wastfull entrance: there the Murtherers,
-Steep'd in the Colours of their Trade; their Daggers
-Vnmannerly breech'd with gore: who could refraine,
-That had a heart to loue; and in that heart,
-Courage, to make's loue knowne?
-  Lady. Helpe me hence, hoa
-
-   Macd. Looke to the Lady
-
-   Mal. Why doe we hold our tongues,
-That most may clayme this argument for ours?
-  Donal. What should be spoken here,
-Where our Fate hid in an augure hole,
-May rush, and seize vs? Let's away,
-Our Teares are not yet brew'd
-
-   Mal. Nor our strong Sorrow
-Vpon the foot of Motion
-
-   Banq. Looke to the Lady:
-And when we haue our naked Frailties hid,
-That suffer in exposure; let vs meet,
-And question this most bloody piece of worke,
-To know it further. Feares and scruples shake vs:
-In the great Hand of God I stand, and thence,
-Against the vndivulg'd pretence, I fight
-Of Treasonous Mallice
-
-   Macd. And so doe I
-
-   All. So all
-
-   Macb. Let's briefely put on manly readinesse,
-And meet i'th' Hall together
-
-   All. Well contented.
-
-Exeunt.
-
-  Malc. What will you doe?
-Let's not consort with them:
-To shew an vnfelt Sorrow, is an Office
-Which the false man do's easie.
-Ile to England
-
-   Don. To Ireland, I:
-Our seperated fortune shall keepe vs both the safer:
-Where we are, there's Daggers in mens smiles;
-The neere in blood, the neerer bloody
-
-   Malc. This murtherous Shaft that's shot,
-Hath not yet lighted: and our safest way,
-Is to auoid the ayme. Therefore to Horse,
-And let vs not be daintie of leaue-taking,
-But shift away: there's warrant in that Theft,
-Which steales it selfe, when there's no mercie left.
-
-Exeunt.
-
-
-
-Scena Quarta.
-
-Enter Rosse, with an Old man.
-
-  Old man. Threescore and ten I can remember well,
-Within the Volume of which Time, I haue seene
-Houres dreadfull, and things strange: but this sore Night
-Hath trifled former knowings
-
-   Rosse. Ha, good Father,
-Thou seest the Heauens, as troubled with mans Act,
-Threatens his bloody Stage: byth' Clock 'tis Day,
-And yet darke Night strangles the trauailing Lampe:
-Is't Nights predominance, or the Dayes shame,
-That Darknesse does the face of Earth intombe,
-When liuing Light should kisse it?
-  Old man. 'Tis vnnaturall,
-Euen like the deed that's done: On Tuesday last,
-A Faulcon towring in her pride of place,
-Was by a Mowsing Owle hawkt at, and kill'd
-
-   Rosse. And Duncans Horses,
-(A thing most strange, and certaine)
-Beauteous, and swift, the Minions of their Race,
-Turn'd wilde in nature, broke their stalls, flong out,
-Contending 'gainst Obedience, as they would
-Make Warre with Mankinde
-
-   Old man. 'Tis said, they eate each other
-
-   Rosse. They did so:
-To th' amazement of mine eyes that look'd vpon't.
-Enter Macduffe.
-
-Heere comes the good Macduffe.
-How goes the world Sir, now?
-  Macd. Why see you not?
-  Ross. Is't known who did this more then bloody deed?
-  Macd. Those that Macbeth hath slaine
-
-   Ross. Alas the day,
-What good could they pretend?
-  Macd. They were subborned,
-Malcolme, and Donalbaine the Kings two Sonnes
-Are stolne away and fled, which puts vpon them
-Suspition of the deed
-
-   Rosse. 'Gainst Nature still,
-Thriftlesse Ambition, that will rauen vp
-Thine owne liues meanes: Then 'tis most like,
-The Soueraignty will fall vpon Macbeth
-
-   Macd. He is already nam'd, and gone to Scone
-To be inuested
-
-   Rosse. Where is Duncans body?
-  Macd. Carried to Colmekill,
-The Sacred Store-house of his Predecessors,
-And Guardian of their Bones
-
-   Rosse. Will you to Scone?
-  Macd. No Cosin, Ile to Fife
-
-   Rosse. Well, I will thither
-
-   Macd. Well may you see things wel done there: Adieu
-Least our old Robes sit easier then our new
-
-   Rosse. Farewell, Father
-
-   Old M. Gods benyson go with you, and with those
-That would make good of bad, and Friends of Foes.
-
-Exeunt. omnes
-
-Actus Tertius. Scena Prima.
-
-Enter Banquo.
-
-  Banq. Thou hast it now, King, Cawdor, Glamis, all,
-As the weyard Women promis'd, and I feare
-Thou playd'st most fowly for't: yet it was saide
-It should not stand in thy Posterity,
-But that my selfe should be the Roote, and Father
-Of many Kings. If there come truth from them,
-As vpon thee Macbeth, their Speeches shine,
-Why by the verities on thee made good,
-May they not be my Oracles as well,
-And set me vp in hope. But hush, no more.
-
-Senit sounded. Enter Macbeth as King, Lady Lenox, Rosse, Lords,
-and
-Attendants.
-
-  Macb. Heere's our chiefe Guest
-
-   La. If he had beene forgotten,
-It had bene as a gap in our great Feast,
-And all-thing vnbecomming
-
-   Macb. To night we hold a solemne Supper sir,
-And Ile request your presence
-
-   Banq. Let your Highnesse
-Command vpon me, to the which my duties
-Are with a most indissoluble tye
-For euer knit
-
-   Macb. Ride you this afternoone?
-  Ban. I, my good Lord
-
-   Macb. We should haue else desir'd your good aduice
-(Which still hath been both graue, and prosperous)
-In this dayes Councell: but wee'le take to morrow.
-Is't farre you ride?
-  Ban. As farre, my Lord, as will fill vp the time
-'Twixt this, and Supper. Goe not my Horse the better,
-I must become a borrower of the Night,
-For a darke houre, or twaine
-
-   Macb. Faile not our Feast
-
-   Ban. My Lord, I will not
-
-   Macb. We heare our bloody Cozens are bestow'd
-In England, and in Ireland, not confessing
-Their cruell Parricide, filling their hearers
-With strange inuention. But of that to morrow,
-When therewithall, we shall haue cause of State,
-Crauing vs ioyntly. Hye you to Horse:
-Adieu, till you returne at Night.
-Goes Fleance with you?
-  Ban. I, my good Lord: our time does call vpon's
-
-   Macb. I wish your Horses swift, and sure of foot:
-And so I doe commend you to their backs.
-Farwell.
-
-Exit Banquo.
-
-Let euery man be master of his time,
-Till seuen at Night, to make societie
-The sweeter welcome:
-We will keepe our selfe till Supper time alone:
-While then, God be with you.
-
-Exeunt. Lords.
-
-Sirrha, a word with you: Attend those men
-Our pleasure?
-  Seruant. They are, my Lord, without the Pallace
-Gate
-
-   Macb. Bring them before vs.
-
-Exit Seruant.
-
-To be thus, is nothing, but to be safely thus
-Our feares in Banquo sticke deepe,
-And in his Royaltie of Nature reignes that
-Which would be fear'd. 'Tis much he dares,
-And to that dauntlesse temper of his Minde,
-He hath a Wisdome, that doth guide his Valour,
-To act in safetie. There is none but he,
-Whose being I doe feare: and vnder him,
-My Genius is rebuk'd, as it is said
-Mark Anthonies was by Caesar. He chid the Sisters,
-When first they put the Name of King vpon me,
-And bad them speake to him. Then Prophet-like,
-They hayl'd him Father to a Line of Kings.
-Vpon my Head they plac'd a fruitlesse Crowne,
-And put a barren Scepter in my Gripe,
-Thence to be wrencht with an vnlineall Hand,
-No Sonne of mine succeeding: if't be so,
-For Banquo's Issue haue I fil'd my Minde,
-For them, the gracious Duncan haue I murther'd,
-Put Rancours in the Vessell of my Peace
-Onely for them, and mine eternall Iewell
-Giuen to the common Enemie of Man,
-To make them Kings, the Seedes of Banquo Kings.
-Rather then so, come Fate into the Lyst,
-And champion me to th' vtterance.
-Who's there?
-Enter Seruant, and two Murtherers.
-
-Now goe to the Doore, and stay there till we call.
-
-Exit Seruant.
-
-Was it not yesterday we spoke together?
-  Murth. It was, so please your Highnesse
-
-   Macb. Well then,
-Now haue you consider'd of my speeches:
-Know, that it was he, in the times past,
-Which held you so vnder fortune,
-Which you thought had been our innocent selfe.
-This I made good to you, in our last conference,
-Past in probation with you:
-How you were borne in hand, how crost:
-The Instruments: who wrought with them:
-And all things else, that might
-To halfe a Soule, and to a Notion craz'd,
-Say, Thus did Banquo
-
-   1.Murth. You made it knowne to vs
-
-   Macb. I did so:
-And went further, which is now
-Our point of second meeting.
-Doe you finde your patience so predominant,
-In your nature, that you can let this goe?
-Are you so Gospell'd, to pray for this good man,
-And for his Issue, whose heauie hand
-Hath bow'd you to the Graue, and begger'd
-Yours for euer?
-  1.Murth. We are men, my Liege
-
-   Macb. I, in the Catalogue ye goe for men,
-As Hounds, and Greyhounds, Mungrels, Spaniels, Curres,
-Showghes, Water-Rugs, and Demy-Wolues are clipt
-All by the Name of Dogges: the valued file
-Distinguishes the swift, the slow, the subtle,
-The House-keeper, the Hunter, euery one
-According to the gift, which bounteous Nature
-Hath in him clos'd: whereby he does receiue
-Particular addition, from the Bill,
-That writes them all alike: and so of men.
-Now, if you haue a station in the file,
-Not i'th' worst ranke of Manhood, say't,
-And I will put that Businesse in your Bosomes,
-Whose execution takes your Enemie off,
-Grapples you to the heart; and loue of vs,
-Who weare our Health but sickly in his Life,
-Which in his Death were perfect
-
-   2.Murth. I am one, my Liege,
-Whom the vile Blowes and Buffets of the World
-Hath so incens'd, that I am recklesse what I doe,
-To spight the World
-
-   1.Murth. And I another,
-So wearie with Disasters, tugg'd with Fortune,
-That I would set my Life on any Chance,
-To mend it, or be rid on't
-
-   Macb. Both of you know Banquo was your Enemie
-
-   Murth. True, my Lord
-
-   Macb. So is he mine: and in such bloody distance,
-That euery minute of his being, thrusts
-Against my neer'st of Life: and though I could
-With bare-fac'd power sweepe him from my sight,
-And bid my will auouch it; yet I must not,
-For certaine friends that are both his, and mine,
-Whose loues I may not drop, but wayle his fall,
-Who I my selfe struck downe: and thence it is,
-That I to your assistance doe make loue,
-Masking the Businesse from the common Eye,
-For sundry weightie Reasons
-
-   2.Murth. We shall, my Lord,
-Performe what you command vs
-
-   1.Murth. Though our Liues-
-  Macb. Your Spirits shine through you.
-Within this houre, at most,
-I will aduise you where to plant your selues,
-Acquaint you with the perfect Spy o'th' time,
-The moment on't, for't must be done to Night,
-And something from the Pallace: alwayes thought,
-That I require a clearenesse; and with him,
-To leaue no Rubs nor Botches in the Worke:
-  Fleans , his Sonne, that keepes him companie,
-Whose absence is no lesse materiall to me,
-Then is his Fathers, must embrace the fate
-Of that darke houre: resolue your selues apart,
-Ile come to you anon
-
-   Murth. We are resolu'd, my Lord
-
-   Macb. Ile call vpon you straight: abide within,
-It is concluded: Banquo, thy Soules flight,
-If it finde Heauen, must finde it out to Night.
-
-Exeunt.
-
-
-Scena Secunda.
-
-Enter Macbeths Lady, and a Seruant.
-
-  Lady. Is Banquo gone from Court?
-  Seruant. I, Madame, but returnes againe to Night
-
-   Lady. Say to the King, I would attend his leysure,
-For a few words
-
-   Seruant. Madame, I will.
-Enter.
-
-  Lady. Nought's had, all's spent.
-Where our desire is got without content:
-'Tis safer, to be that which we destroy,
-Then by destruction dwell in doubtfull ioy.
-Enter Macbeth.
-
-How now, my Lord, why doe you keepe alone?
-Of sorryest Fancies your Companions making,
-Vsing those Thoughts, which should indeed haue dy'd
-With them they thinke on: things without all remedie
-Should be without regard: what's done, is done
-
-   Macb. We haue scorch'd the Snake, not kill'd it:
-Shee'le close, and be her selfe, whilest our poore Mallice
-Remaines in danger of her former Tooth.
-But let the frame of things dis-ioynt,
-Both the Worlds suffer,
-Ere we will eate our Meale in feare, and sleepe
-In the affliction of these terrible Dreames,
-That shake vs Nightly: Better be with the dead,
-Whom we, to gayne our peace, haue sent to peace,
-Then on the torture of the Minde to lye
-In restlesse extasie.
-Duncane is in his Graue:
-After Lifes fitfull Feuer, he sleepes well,
-Treason ha's done his worst: nor Steele, nor Poyson,
-Mallice domestique, forraine Leuie, nothing,
-Can touch him further
-
-   Lady. Come on:
-Gentle my Lord, sleeke o're your rugged Lookes,
-Be bright and Iouiall among your Guests to Night
-
-   Macb. So shall I Loue, and so I pray be you:
-Let your remembrance apply to Banquo,
-Present him Eminence, both with Eye and Tongue:
-Vnsafe the while, that wee must laue
-Our Honors in these flattering streames,
-And make our Faces Vizards to our Hearts,
-Disguising what they are
-
-   Lady. You must leaue this
-
-   Macb. O, full of Scorpions is my Minde, deare Wife:
-Thou know'st, that Banquo and his Fleans liues
-
-   Lady. But in them, Natures Coppie's not eterne
-
-   Macb. There's comfort yet, they are assaileable,
-Then be thou iocund: ere the Bat hath flowne
-His Cloyster'd flight, ere to black Heccats summons
-The shard-borne Beetle, with his drowsie hums,
-Hath rung Nights yawning Peale,
-There shall be done a deed of dreadfull note
-
-   Lady. What's to be done?
-  Macb. Be innocent of the knowledge, dearest Chuck,
-Till thou applaud the deed: Come, seeling Night,
-Skarfe vp the tender Eye of pittifull Day,
-And with thy bloodie and inuisible Hand
-Cancell and teare to pieces that great Bond,
-Which keepes me pale. Light thickens,
-And the Crow makes Wing toth' Rookie Wood:
-Good things of Day begin to droope, and drowse,
-Whiles Nights black Agents to their Prey's doe rowse.
-Thou maruell'st at my words: but hold thee still,
-Things bad begun, make strong themselues by ill:
-So prythee goe with me.
-
-Exeunt.
-
-
-Scena Tertia.
-
-Enter three Murtherers.
-
-  1. But who did bid thee ioyne with vs?
-  3. Macbeth
-
-   2. He needes not our mistrust, since he deliuers
-Our Offices, and what we haue to doe,
-To the direction iust
-
-   1. Then stand with vs:
-The West yet glimmers with some streakes of Day.
-Now spurres the lated Traueller apace,
-To gayne the timely Inne, and neere approches
-The subiect of our Watch
-
-   3. Hearke, I heare Horses
-
-   Banquo within. Giue vs a Light there, hoa
-
-   2. Then 'tis hee:
-The rest, that are within the note of expectation,
-Alreadie are i'th' Court
-
-   1. His Horses goe about
-
-   3. Almost a mile: but he does vsually,
-So all men doe, from hence toth' Pallace Gate
-Make it their Walke.
-Enter Banquo and Fleans, with a Torch.
-
-  2. A Light, a Light
-
-   3. 'Tis hee
-
-   1. Stand too't
-
-   Ban. It will be Rayne to Night
-
-   1. Let it come downe
-
-   Ban. O, Trecherie!
-Flye good Fleans, flye, flye, flye,
-Thou may'st reuenge. O Slaue!
-  3. Who did strike out the Light?
-  1. Was't not the way?
-  3. There's but one downe: the Sonne is fled
-
-   2. We haue lost
-Best halfe of our Affaire
-
-   1. Well, let's away, and say how much is done.
-
-Exeunt.
-
-
-Scaena Quarta.
-
-Banquet prepar'd. Enter Macbeth, Lady, Rosse, Lenox, Lords, and
-Attendants.
-
-  Macb. You know your owne degrees, sit downe:
-At first and last, the hearty welcome
-
-   Lords. Thankes to your Maiesty
-
-   Macb. Our selfe will mingle with Society,
-And play the humble Host:
-Our Hostesse keepes her State, but in best time
-We will require her welcome
-
-   La. Pronounce it for me Sir, to all our Friends,
-For my heart speakes, they are welcome.
-Enter first Murtherer.
-
-  Macb. See they encounter thee with their harts thanks
-Both sides are euen: heere Ile sit i'th' mid'st,
-Be large in mirth, anon wee'l drinke a Measure
-The Table round. There's blood vpon thy face
-
-   Mur. 'Tis Banquo's then
-
-   Macb. 'Tis better thee without, then he within.
-Is he dispatch'd?
-  Mur. My Lord his throat is cut, that I did for him
-
-   Mac. Thou art the best o'th' Cut-throats,
-Yet hee's good that did the like for Fleans:
-If thou did'st it, thou art the Non-pareill
-
-   Mur. Most Royall Sir
-Fleans is scap'd
-
-   Macb. Then comes my Fit againe:
-I had else beene perfect;
-Whole as the Marble, founded as the Rocke,
-As broad, and generall, as the casing Ayre:
-But now I am cabin'd, crib'd, confin'd, bound in
-To sawcy doubts, and feares. But Banquo's safe?
-  Mur. I, my good Lord: safe in a ditch he bides,
-With twenty trenched gashes on his head;
-The least a Death to Nature
-
-   Macb. Thankes for that:
-There the growne Serpent lyes, the worme that's fled
-Hath Nature that in time will Venom breed,
-No teeth for th' present. Get thee gone, to morrow
-Wee'l heare our selues againe.
-
-Exit Murderer.
-
-  Lady. My Royall Lord,
-You do not giue the Cheere, the Feast is sold
-That is not often vouch'd, while 'tis a making:
-'Tis giuen, with welcome: to feede were best at home:
-From thence, the sawce to meate is Ceremony,
-Meeting were bare without it.
-Enter the Ghost of Banquo, and sits in Macbeths place.
-
-  Macb. Sweet Remembrancer:
-Now good digestion waite on Appetite,
-And health on both
-
-   Lenox. May't please your Highnesse sit
-
-   Macb. Here had we now our Countries Honor, roof'd,
-Were the grac'd person of our Banquo present:
-Who, may I rather challenge for vnkindnesse,
-Then pitty for Mischance
-
-   Rosse. His absence (Sir)
-Layes blame vpon his promise. Pleas't your Highnesse
-To grace vs with your Royall Company?
-  Macb. The Table's full
-
-   Lenox. Heere is a place reseru'd Sir
-
-   Macb. Where?
-  Lenox. Heere my good Lord.
-What is't that moues your Highnesse?
-  Macb. Which of you haue done this?
-  Lords. What, my good Lord?
-  Macb. Thou canst not say I did it: neuer shake
-Thy goary lockes at me
-
-   Rosse. Gentlemen rise, his Highnesse is not well
-
-   Lady. Sit worthy Friends: my Lord is often thus,
-And hath beene from his youth. Pray you keepe Seat,
-The fit is momentary, vpon a thought
-He will againe be well. If much you note him
-You shall offend him, and extend his Passion,
-Feed, and regard him not. Are you a man?
-  Macb. I, and a bold one, that dare looke on that
-Which might appall the Diuell
-
-   La. O proper stuffe:
-This is the very painting of your feare:
-This is the Ayre-drawne-Dagger which you said
-Led you to Duncan. O, these flawes and starts
-(Impostors to true feare) would well become
-A womans story, at a Winters fire
-Authoriz'd by her Grandam: shame it selfe,
-Why do you make such faces? When all's done
-You looke but on a stoole
-
-   Macb. Prythee see there:
-Behold, looke, loe, how say you:
-Why what care I, if thou canst nod, speake too.
-If Charnell houses, and our Graues must send
-Those that we bury, backe; our Monuments
-Shall be the Mawes of Kytes
-
-   La. What? quite vnmann'd in folly
-
-   Macb. If I stand heere, I saw him
-
-   La. Fie for shame
-
-   Macb. Blood hath bene shed ere now, i'th' olden time
-Ere humane Statute purg'd the gentle Weale:
-I, and since too, Murthers haue bene perform'd
-Too terrible for the eare. The times has bene,
-That when the Braines were out, the man would dye,
-And there an end: But now they rise againe
-With twenty mortall murthers on their crownes,
-And push vs from our stooles. This is more strange
-Then such a murther is
-
-   La. My worthy Lord
-Your Noble Friends do lacke you
-
-   Macb. I do forget:
-Do not muse at me my most worthy Friends,
-I haue a strange infirmity, which is nothing
-To those that know me. Come, loue and health to all,
-Then Ile sit downe: Giue me some Wine, fill full:
-Enter Ghost.
-
-I drinke to th' generall ioy o'th' whole Table,
-And to our deere Friend Banquo, whom we misse:
-Would he were heere: to all, and him we thirst,
-And all to all
-
-   Lords. Our duties, and the pledge
-
-   Mac. Auant, & quit my sight, let the earth hide thee:
-Thy bones are marrowlesse, thy blood is cold:
-Thou hast no speculation in those eyes
-Which thou dost glare with
-
-   La. Thinke of this good Peeres
-But as a thing of Custome: 'Tis no other,
-Onely it spoyles the pleasure of the time
-
-   Macb. What man dare, I dare:
-Approach thou like the rugged Russian Beare,
-The arm'd Rhinoceros, or th' Hircan Tiger,
-Take any shape but that, and my firme Nerues
-Shall neuer tremble. Or be aliue againe,
-And dare me to the Desart with thy Sword:
-If trembling I inhabit then, protest mee
-The Baby of a Girle. Hence horrible shadow,
-Vnreall mock'ry hence. Why so, being gone
-I am a man againe: pray you sit still
-
-   La. You haue displac'd the mirth,
-Broke the good meeting, with most admir'd disorder
-
-   Macb. Can such things be,
-And ouercome vs like a Summers Clowd,
-Without our speciall wonder? You make me strange
-Euen to the disposition that I owe,
-When now I thinke you can behold such sights,
-And keepe the naturall Rubie of your Cheekes,
-When mine is blanch'd with feare
-
-   Rosse. What sights, my Lord?
-  La. I pray you speake not: he growes worse & worse
-Question enrages him: at once, goodnight.
-Stand not vpon the order of your going,
-But go at once
-
-   Len. Good night, and better health
-Attend his Maiesty
-
-   La. A kinde goodnight to all.
-
-Exit Lords.
-
-  Macb. It will haue blood they say:
-Blood will haue Blood:
-Stones haue beene knowne to moue, & Trees to speake:
-Augures, and vnderstood Relations, haue
-By Maggot Pyes, & Choughes, & Rookes brought forth
-The secret'st man of Blood. What is the night?
-  La. Almost at oddes with morning, which is which
-
-   Macb. How say'st thou that Macduff denies his person
-At our great bidding
-
-   La. Did you send to him Sir?
-  Macb. I heare it by the way: But I will send:
-There's not a one of them but in his house
-I keepe a Seruant Feed. I will to morrow
-(And betimes I will) to the weyard Sisters.
-More shall they speake: for now I am bent to know
-By the worst meanes, the worst, for mine owne good,
-All causes shall giue way. I am in blood
-Stept in so farre, that should I wade no more,
-Returning were as tedious as go ore:
-Strange things I haue in head, that will to hand,
-Which must be acted, ere they may be scand
-
-   La. You lacke the season of all Natures, sleepe
-
-   Macb. Come, wee'l to sleepe: My strange & self-abuse
-Is the initiate feare, that wants hard vse:
-We are yet but yong indeed.
-
-Exeunt.
-
-
-Scena Quinta.
-
-Thunder. Enter the three Witches, meeting Hecat.
-
-  1. Why how now Hecat, you looke angerly?
-  Hec. Haue I not reason (Beldams) as you are?
-Sawcy, and ouer-bold, how did you dare
-To Trade, and Trafficke with Macbeth,
-In Riddles, and Affaires of death;
-And I the Mistris of your Charmes,
-The close contriuer of all harmes,
-Was neuer call'd to beare my part,
-Or shew the glory of our Art?
-And which is worse, all you haue done
-Hath bene but for a wayward Sonne,
-Spightfull, and wrathfull, who (as others do)
-Loues for his owne ends, not for you.
-But make amends now: Get you gon,
-And at the pit of Acheron
-Meete me i'th' Morning: thither he
-Will come, to know his Destinie.
-Your Vessels, and your Spels prouide,
-Your Charmes, and euery thing beside;
-I am for th' Ayre: This night Ile spend
-Vnto a dismall, and a Fatall end.
-Great businesse must be wrought ere Noone.
-Vpon the Corner of the Moone
-There hangs a vap'rous drop, profound,
-Ile catch it ere it come to ground;
-And that distill'd by Magicke slights,
-Shall raise such Artificiall Sprights,
-As by the strength of their illusion,
-Shall draw him on to his Confusion.
-He shall spurne Fate, scorne Death, and beare
-His hopes 'boue Wisedome, Grace, and Feare:
-And you all know, Security
-Is Mortals cheefest Enemie.
-
-Musicke, and a Song.
-
-Hearke, I am call'd: my little Spirit see
-Sits in Foggy cloud, and stayes for me.
-
-Sing within. Come away, come away, &c.
-
-  1 Come, let's make hast, shee'l soone be
-Backe againe.
-
-Exeunt.
-
-
-Scaena Sexta.
-
-Enter Lenox, and another Lord.
-
-  Lenox. My former Speeches,
-Haue but hit your Thoughts
-Which can interpret farther: Onely I say
-Things haue bin strangely borne. The gracious Duncan
-Was pittied of Macbeth: marry he was dead:
-And the right valiant Banquo walk'd too late,
-Whom you may say (if't please you) Fleans kill'd,
-For Fleans fled: Men must not walke too late.
-Who cannot want the thought, how monstrous
-It was for Malcolme, and for Donalbane
-To kill their gracious Father? Damned Fact,
-How it did greeue Macbeth? Did he not straight
-In pious rage, the two delinquents teare,
-That were the Slaues of drinke, and thralles of sleepe?
-Was not that Nobly done? I, and wisely too:
-For 'twould haue anger'd any heart aliue
-To heare the men deny't. So that I say,
-He ha's borne all things well, and I do thinke,
-That had he Duncans Sonnes vnder his Key,
-(As, and't please Heauen he shall not) they should finde
-What 'twere to kill a Father: So should Fleans.
-But peace; for from broad words, and cause he fayl'd
-His presence at the Tyrants Feast, I heare
-Macduffe liues in disgrace. Sir, can you tell
-Where he bestowes himselfe?
-  Lord. The Sonnes of Duncane
-(From whom this Tyrant holds the due of Birth)
-Liues in the English Court, and is receyu'd
-Of the most Pious Edward, with such grace,
-That the maleuolence of Fortune, nothing
-Takes from his high respect. Thither Macduffe
-Is gone, to pray the Holy King, vpon his ayd
-To wake Northumberland, and warlike Seyward,
-That by the helpe of these (with him aboue)
-To ratifie the Worke) we may againe
-Giue to our Tables meate, sleepe to our Nights:
-Free from our Feasts, and Banquets bloody kniues;
-Do faithfull Homage, and receiue free Honors,
-All which we pine for now. And this report
-Hath so exasperate their King, that hee
-Prepares for some attempt of Warre
-
-   Len. Sent he to Macduffe?
-  Lord. He did: and with an absolute Sir, not I
-The clowdy Messenger turnes me his backe,
-And hums; as who should say, you'l rue the time
-That clogges me with this Answer
-
-   Lenox. And that well might
-Aduise him to a Caution, t' hold what distance
-His wisedome can prouide. Some holy Angell
-Flye to the Court of England, and vnfold
-His Message ere he come, that a swift blessing
-May soone returne to this our suffering Country,
-Vnder a hand accurs'd
-
-   Lord. Ile send my Prayers with him.
-
-Exeunt.
-
-Actus Quartus. Scena Prima.
-
-Thunder. Enter the three Witches.
-
-  1 Thrice the brinded Cat hath mew'd
-
-   2 Thrice, and once the Hedge-Pigge whin'd
-

-
-   1 Round about the Caldron go:
-In the poysond Entrailes throw
-Toad, that vnder cold stone,
-Dayes and Nights, ha's thirty one:
-Sweltred Venom sleeping got,
-Boyle thou first i'th' charmed pot
-
-   All. Double, double, toile and trouble;
-Fire burne, and Cauldron bubble
-
-   2 Fillet of a Fenny Snake,
-In the Cauldron boyle and bake:
-Eye of Newt, and Toe of Frogge,
-Wooll of Bat, and Tongue of Dogge:
-Adders Forke, and Blinde-wormes Sting,
-Lizards legge, and Howlets wing:
-For a Charme of powrefull trouble,
-Like a Hell-broth, boyle and bubble
-
-   All. Double, double, toyle and trouble,
-Fire burne, and Cauldron bubble
-
-   3 Scale of Dragon, Tooth of Wolfe,
-Witches Mummey, Maw, and Gulfe
-Of the rauin'd salt Sea sharke:
-Roote of Hemlocke, digg'd i'th' darke:
-Liuer of Blaspheming Iew,
-Gall of Goate, and Slippes of Yew,
-Sliuer'd in the Moones Ecclipse:
-Nose of Turke, and Tartars lips:
-Finger of Birth-strangled Babe,
-Ditch-deliuer'd by a Drab,
-Make the Grewell thicke, and slab.
-Adde thereto a Tigers Chawdron,
-For th' Ingredience of our Cawdron
-
-   All. Double, double, toyle and trouble,
-Fire burne, and Cauldron bubble
-
-   2 Coole it with a Baboones blood,
-Then the Charme is firme and good.
-Enter Hecat, and the other three Witches.
-
-  Hec. O well done: I commend your paines,
-And euery one shall share i'th' gaines:
-And now about the Cauldron sing
-Like Elues and Fairies in a Ring,
-Inchanting all that you put in.
-
-Musicke and a Song. Blacke Spirits, &c.
-
-  2 By the pricking of my Thumbes,
-Something wicked this way comes:
-Open Lockes, who euer knockes.
-Enter Macbeth.
-
-  Macb. How now you secret, black, & midnight Hags?
-What is't you do?
-  All. A deed without a name
-
-   Macb. I coniure you, by that which you Professe,
-(How ere you come to know it) answer me:
-Though you vntye the Windes, and let them fight
-Against the Churches: Though the yesty Waues
-Confound and swallow Nauigation vp:
-Though bladed Corne be lodg'd, & Trees blown downe,
-Though Castles topple on their Warders heads:
-Though Pallaces, and Pyramids do slope
-Their heads to their Foundations: Though the treasure
-Of Natures Germaine, tumble altogether,
-Euen till destruction sicken: Answer me
-To what I aske you
-
-   1 Speake
-
-   2 Demand
-
-   3 Wee'l answer
-
-   1 Say, if th'hadst rather heare it from our mouthes,
-Or from our Masters
-
-   Macb. Call 'em: let me see 'em
-
-   1 Powre in Sowes blood, that hath eaten
-Her nine Farrow: Greaze that's sweaten
-From the Murderers Gibbet, throw
-Into the Flame
-
-   All. Come high or low:
-Thy Selfe and Office deaftly show.
-Thunder. 1. Apparation, an Armed Head.
-
-  Macb. Tell me, thou vnknowne power
-
-   1 He knowes thy thought:
-Heare his speech, but say thou nought
-
-   1 Appar. Macbeth, Macbeth, Macbeth:
-Beware Macduffe,
-Beware the Thane of Fife: dismisse me. Enough.
-
-He Descends.
-
-  Macb. What ere thou art, for thy good caution, thanks
-Thou hast harp'd my feare aright. But one word more
-
-   1 He will not be commanded: heere's another
-More potent then the first.
-
-Thunder. 2 Apparition, a Bloody Childe.
-
-  2 Appar. Macbeth, Macbeth, Macbeth
-
-   Macb. Had I three eares, Il'd heare thee
-
-   Appar. Be bloody, bold, & resolute:
-Laugh to scorne
-The powre of man: For none of woman borne
-Shall harme Macbeth.
-
-Descends.
-
-  Mac. Then liue Macduffe: what need I feare of thee?
-But yet Ile make assurance: double sure,
-And take a Bond of Fate: thou shalt not liue,
-That I may tell pale-hearted Feare, it lies;
-And sleepe in spight of Thunder.
-
-Thunder 3 Apparation, a Childe Crowned, with a Tree in his hand.
-
-What is this, that rises like the issue of a King,
-And weares vpon his Baby-brow, the round
-And top of Soueraignty?
-  All. Listen, but speake not too't
-
-   3 Appar. Be Lyon metled, proud, and take no care:
-Who chafes, who frets, or where Conspirers are:
-Macbeth shall neuer vanquish'd be, vntill
-Great Byrnam Wood, to high Dunsmane Hill
-Shall come against him.
-
-Descend.
-
-  Macb. That will neuer bee:
-Who can impresse the Forrest, bid the Tree
-Vnfixe his earth-bound Root? Sweet boadments, good:
-Rebellious dead, rise neuer till the Wood
-Of Byrnan rise, and our high plac'd Macbeth
-Shall liue the Lease of Nature, pay his breath
-To time, and mortall Custome. Yet my Hart
-Throbs to know one thing: Tell me, if your Art
-Can tell so much: Shall Banquo's issue euer
-Reigne in this Kingdome?
-  All. Seeke to know no more
-
-   Macb. I will be satisfied. Deny me this,
-And an eternall Curse fall on you: Let me know.
-Why sinkes that Caldron? & what noise is this?
-
-Hoboyes
-
-  1 Shew
-
-   2 Shew
-
-   3 Shew
-
-   All. Shew his Eyes, and greeue his Hart,
-Come like shadowes, so depart.
-
-A shew of eight Kings, and Banquo last, with a glasse in his hand.
-
-  Macb. Thou art too like the Spirit of Banquo: Down:
-Thy Crowne do's seare mine Eye-bals. And thy haire
-Thou other Gold-bound-brow, is like the first:
-A third, is like the former. Filthy Hagges,
-Why do you shew me this? - A fourth? Start eyes!
-What will the Line stretch out to'th' cracke of Doome?
-Another yet? A seauenth? Ile see no more:
-And yet the eighth appeares, who beares a glasse,
-Which shewes me many more: and some I see,
-That two-fold Balles, and trebble Scepters carry.
-Horrible sight: Now I see 'tis true,
-For the Blood-bolter'd Banquo smiles vpon me,
-And points at them for his. What? is this so?
-  1 I Sir, all this is so. But why
-Stands Macbeth thus amazedly?
-Come Sisters, cheere we vp his sprights,
-And shew the best of our delights.
-Ile Charme the Ayre to giue a sound,
-While you performe your Antique round:
-That this great King may kindly say,
-Our duties, did his welcome pay.
-
-Musicke. The Witches Dance, and vanish.
-
-  Macb. Where are they? Gone?
-Let this pernitious houre,
-Stand aye accursed in the Kalender.
-Come in, without there.
-Enter Lenox.
-
-  Lenox. What's your Graces will
-
-   Macb. Saw you the Weyard Sisters?
-  Lenox. No my Lord
-
-   Macb. Came they not by you?
-  Lenox. No indeed my Lord
-
-   Macb. Infected be the Ayre whereon they ride,
-And damn'd all those that trust them. I did heare
-The gallopping of Horse. Who was't came by?
-  Len. 'Tis two or three my Lord, that bring you word:
-Macduff is fled to England
-
-   Macb. Fled to England?
-  Len. I, my good Lord
-
-   Macb. Time, thou anticipat'st my dread exploits:
-The flighty purpose neuer is o're-tooke
-Vnlesse the deed go with it. From this moment,
-The very firstlings of my heart shall be
-The firstlings of my hand. And euen now
-To Crown my thoughts with Acts: be it thoght & done:
-The Castle of Macduff, I will surprize.
-Seize vpon Fife; giue to th' edge o'th' Sword
-His Wife, his Babes, and all vnfortunate Soules
-That trace him in his Line. No boasting like a Foole,
-This deed Ile do, before this purpose coole,
-But no more sights. Where are these Gentlemen?
-Come bring me where they are.
-
-Exeunt.
-
-Scena Secunda.
-
-Enter Macduffes Wife, her Son, and Rosse.
-
-  Wife. What had he done, to make him fly the Land?
-  Rosse. You must haue patience Madam
-
-   Wife. He had none:
-His flight was madnesse: when our Actions do not,
-Our feares do make vs Traitors
-
-   Rosse. You know not
-Whether it was his wisedome, or his feare
-
-   Wife. Wisedom? to leaue his wife, to leaue his Babes,
-His Mansion, and his Titles, in a place
-From whence himselfe do's flye? He loues vs not,
-He wants the naturall touch. For the poore Wren
-(The most diminitiue of Birds) will fight,
-Her yong ones in her Nest, against the Owle:
-All is the Feare, and nothing is the Loue;
-As little is the Wisedome, where the flight
-So runnes against all reason
-
-   Rosse. My deerest Cooz,
-I pray you schoole your selfe. But for your Husband,
-He is Noble, Wise, Iudicious, and best knowes
-The fits o'th' Season. I dare not speake much further,
-But cruell are the times, when we are Traitors
-And do not know our selues: when we hold Rumor
-From what we feare, yet know not what we feare,
-But floate vpon a wilde and violent Sea
-Each way, and moue. I take my leaue of you:
-Shall not be long but Ile be heere againe:
-Things at the worst will cease, or else climbe vpward,
-To what they were before. My pretty Cosine,
-Blessing vpon you
-
-   Wife. Father'd he is,
-And yet hee's Father-lesse
-
-   Rosse. I am so much a Foole, should I stay longer
-It would be my disgrace, and your discomfort.
-I take my leaue at once.
-
-Exit Rosse.
-
-  Wife. Sirra, your Fathers dead,
-And what will you do now? How will you liue?
-  Son. As Birds do Mother
-
-   Wife. What with Wormes, and Flyes?
-  Son. With what I get I meane, and so do they
-
-   Wife. Poore Bird,
-Thou'dst neuer Feare the Net, nor Lime,
-The Pitfall, nor the Gin
-
-   Son. Why should I Mother?
-Poore Birds they are not set for:
-My Father is not dead for all your saying
-
-   Wife. Yes, he is dead:
-How wilt thou do for a Father?
-  Son. Nay how will you do for a Husband?
-  Wife. Why I can buy me twenty at any Market
-
-   Son. Then you'l by 'em to sell againe
-
-   Wife. Thou speak'st withall thy wit,
-And yet I'faith with wit enough for thee
-
-   Son. Was my Father a Traitor, Mother?
-  Wife. I, that he was
-
-   Son. What is a Traitor?
-  Wife. Why one that sweares, and lyes
-
-   Son. And be all Traitors, that do so
-
-   Wife. Euery one that do's so, is a Traitor,
-And must be hang'd
-
-   Son. And must they all be hang'd, that swear and lye?
-  Wife. Euery one
-
-   Son. Who must hang them?
-  Wife. Why, the honest men
-
-   Son. Then the Liars and Swearers are Fools: for there
-are Lyars and Swearers enow, to beate the honest men,
-and hang vp them
-
-   Wife. Now God helpe thee, poore Monkie:
-But how wilt thou do for a Father?
-  Son. If he were dead, youl'd weepe for him: if you
-would not, it were a good signe, that I should quickely
-haue a new Father
-
-   Wife. Poore pratler, how thou talk'st?
-Enter a Messenger.
-
-  Mes. Blesse you faire Dame: I am not to you known,
-Though in your state of Honor I am perfect;
-I doubt some danger do's approach you neerely.
-If you will take a homely mans aduice,
-Be not found heere: Hence with your little ones
-To fright you thus. Me thinkes I am too sauage:
-To do worse to you, were fell Cruelty,
-Which is too nie your person. Heauen preserue you,
-I dare abide no longer.
-
-Exit Messenger
-
-  Wife. Whether should I flye?
-I haue done no harme. But I remember now
-I am in this earthly world: where to do harme
-Is often laudable, to do good sometime
-Accounted dangerous folly. Why then (alas)
-Do I put vp that womanly defence,
-To say I haue done no harme?
-What are these faces?
-Enter Murtherers.
-
-  Mur. Where is your Husband?
-  Wife. I hope in no place so vnsanctified,
-Where such as thou may'st finde him
-
-   Mur. He's a Traitor
-
-   Son. Thou ly'st thou shagge-ear'd Villaine
-
-   Mur. What you Egge?
-Yong fry of Treachery?
-  Son. He ha's kill'd me Mother,
-Run away I pray you.
-
-Exit crying Murther.
-
-
-Scaena Tertia.
-
-Enter Malcolme and Macduffe.
-
-  Mal. Let vs seeke out some desolate shade, & there
-Weepe our sad bosomes empty
-
-   Macd. Let vs rather
-Hold fast the mortall Sword: and like good men,
-Bestride our downfall Birthdome: each new Morne,
-New Widdowes howle, new Orphans cry, new sorowes
-Strike heauen on the face, that it resounds
-As if it felt with Scotland, and yell'd out
-Like Syllable of Dolour
-
-   Mal. What I beleeue, Ile waile;
-What know, beleeue; and what I can redresse,
-As I shall finde the time to friend: I wil.
-What you haue spoke, it may be so perchance.
-This Tyrant, whose sole name blisters our tongues,
-Was once thought honest: you haue lou'd him well,
-He hath not touch'd you yet. I am yong, but something
-You may discerne of him through me, and wisedome
-To offer vp a weake, poore innocent Lambe
-T' appease an angry God
-
-   Macd. I am not treacherous
-
-   Malc. But Macbeth is.
-A good and vertuous Nature may recoyle
-In an Imperiall charge. But I shall craue your pardon:
-That which you are, my thoughts cannot transpose;
-Angels are bright still, though the brightest fell.
-Though all things foule, would wear the brows of grace
-Yet Grace must still looke so
-
-   Macd. I haue lost my Hopes
-
-   Malc. Perchance euen there
-Where I did finde my doubts.
-Why in that rawnesse left you Wife, and Childe?
-Those precious Motiues, those strong knots of Loue,
-Without leaue-taking. I pray you,
-Let not my Iealousies, be your Dishonors,
-But mine owne Safeties: you may be rightly iust,
-What euer I shall thinke
-
-   Macd. Bleed, bleed poore Country,
-Great Tyrrany, lay thou thy basis sure,
-For goodnesse dare not check thee: wear y thy wrongs,
-The Title, is affear'd. Far thee well Lord,
-I would not be the Villaine that thou think'st,
-For the whole Space that's in the Tyrants Graspe,
-And the rich East to boot
-
-   Mal. Be not offended:
-I speake not as in absolute feare of you:
-I thinke our Country sinkes beneath the yoake,
-It weepes, it bleeds, and each new day a gash
-Is added to her wounds. I thinke withall,
-There would be hands vplifted in my right:
-And heere from gracious England haue I offer
-Of goodly thousands. But for all this,
-When I shall treade vpon the Tyrants head,
-Or weare it on my Sword; yet my poore Country
-Shall haue more vices then it had before,
-More suffer, and more sundry wayes then euer,
-By him that shall succeede
-
-   Macd. What should he be?
-  Mal. It is my selfe I meane: in whom I know
-All the particulars of Vice so grafted,
-That when they shall be open'd, blacke Macbeth
-Will seeme as pure as Snow, and the poore State
-Esteeme him as a Lambe, being compar'd
-With my confinelesse harmes
-
-   Macd. Not in the Legions
-Of horrid Hell, can come a Diuell more damn'd
-In euils, to top Macbeth
-
-   Mal. I grant him Bloody,
-Luxurious, Auaricious, False, Deceitfull,
-Sodaine, Malicious, smacking of euery sinne
-That ha's a name. But there's no bottome, none
-In my Voluptuousnesse: Your Wiues, your Daughters,
-Your Matrons, and your Maides, could not fill vp
-The Cesterne of my Lust, and my Desire
-All continent Impediments would ore-beare
-That did oppose my will. Better Macbeth,
-Then such an one to reigne
-
-   Macd. Boundlesse intemperance
-In Nature is a Tyranny: It hath beene
-Th' vntimely emptying of the happy Throne,
-And fall of many Kings. But feare not yet
-To take vpon you what is yours: you may
-Conuey your pleasures in a spacious plenty,
-And yet seeme cold. The time you may so hoodwinke:
-We haue willing Dames enough: there cannot be
-That Vulture in you, to deuoure so many
-As will to Greatnesse dedicate themselues,
-Finding it so inclinde
-
-   Mal. With this, there growes
-In my most ill-composd Affection, such
-A stanchlesse Auarice, that were I King,
-I should cut off the Nobles for their Lands,
-Desire his Iewels, and this others House,
-And my more-hauing, would be as a Sawce
-To make me hunger more, that I should forge
-Quarrels vniust against the Good and Loyall,
-Destroying them for wealth
-
-   Macd. This Auarice
-stickes deeper: growes with more pernicious roote
-Then Summer-seeming Lust: and it hath bin
-The Sword of our slaine Kings: yet do not feare,
-Scotland hath Foysons, to fill vp your will
-Of your meere Owne. All these are portable,
-With other Graces weigh'd
-
-   Mal. But I haue none. The King-becoming Graces,
-As Iustice, Verity, Temp'rance, Stablenesse,
-Bounty, Perseuerance, Mercy, Lowlinesse,
-Deuotion, Patience, Courage, Fortitude,
-I haue no rellish of them, but abound
-In the diuision of each seuerall Crime,
-Acting it many wayes. Nay, had I powre, I should
-Poure the sweet Milke of Concord, into Hell,
-Vprore the vniuersall peace, confound
-All vnity on earth
-
-   Macd. O Scotland, Scotland
-
-   Mal. If such a one be fit to gouerne, speake:
-I am as I haue spoken
-
-   Mac. Fit to gouern? No not to liue. O Natio[n] miserable!
-With an vntitled Tyrant, bloody Sceptred,
-When shalt thou see thy wholsome dayes againe?
-Since that the truest Issue of thy Throne
-By his owne Interdiction stands accust,
-And do's blaspheme his breed? Thy Royall Father
-Was a most Sainted-King: the Queene that bore thee,
-Oftner vpon her knees, then on her feet,
-Dy'de euery day she liu'd. Fare thee well,
-These Euils thou repeat'st vpon thy selfe,
-Hath banish'd me from Scotland. O my Brest,
-Thy hope ends heere
-
-   Mal. Macduff, this Noble passion
-Childe of integrity, hath from my soule
-Wip'd the blacke Scruples, reconcil'd my thoughts
-To thy good Truth, and Honor. Diuellish Macbeth,
-By many of these traines, hath sought to win me
-Into his power: and modest Wisedome pluckes me
-From ouer-credulous hast: but God aboue
-Deale betweene thee and me; For euen now
-I put my selfe to thy Direction, and
-Vnspeake mine owne detraction. Heere abiure
-The taints, and blames I laide vpon my selfe,
-For strangers to my Nature. I am yet
-Vnknowne to Woman, neuer was forsworne,
-Scarsely haue coueted what was mine owne.
-At no time broke my Faith, would not betray
-The Deuill to his Fellow, and delight
-No lesse in truth then life. My first false speaking
-Was this vpon my selfe. What I am truly
-Is thine, and my poore Countries to command:
-Whither indeed, before they heere approach
-Old Seyward with ten thousand warlike men
-Already at a point, was setting foorth:
-Now wee'l together, and the chance of goodnesse
-Be like our warranted Quarrell. Why are you silent?
-  Macd. Such welcome, and vnwelcom things at once
-'Tis hard to reconcile.
-Enter a Doctor.
-
-  Mal. Well, more anon. Comes the King forth
-I pray you?
-  Doct. I Sir: there are a crew of wretched Soules
-That stay his Cure: their malady conuinces
-The great assay of Art. But at his touch,
-Such sanctity hath Heauen giuen his hand,
-They presently amend.
-Enter.
-
-  Mal. I thanke you Doctor
-
-   Macd. What's the Disease he meanes?
-  Mal. Tis call'd the Euill.
-A most myraculous worke in this good King,
-Which often since my heere remaine in England,
-I haue seene him do: How he solicites heauen
-Himselfe best knowes: but strangely visited people
-All swolne and Vlcerous, pittifull to the eye,
-The meere dispaire of Surgery, he cures,
-Hanging a golden stampe about their neckes,
-Put on with holy Prayers, and 'tis spoken
-To the succeeding Royalty he leaues
-The healing Benediction. With this strange vertue,
-He hath a heauenly guift of Prophesie,
-And sundry Blessings hang about his Throne,
-That speake him full of Grace.
-Enter Rosse.
-
-  Macd. See who comes heere
-
-   Malc. My Countryman: but yet I know him not
-
-   Macd. My euer gentle Cozen, welcome hither
-
-   Malc. I know him now. Good God betimes remoue
-The meanes that makes vs Strangers
-
-   Rosse. Sir, Amen
-
-   Macd. Stands Scotland where it did?
-  Rosse. Alas poore Countrey,
-Almost affraid to know it selfe. It cannot
-Be call'd our Mother, but our Graue; where nothing
-But who knowes nothing, is once seene to smile:
-Where sighes, and groanes, and shrieks that rent the ayre
-Are made, not mark'd: Where violent sorrow seemes
-A Moderne extasie: The Deadmans knell,
-Is there scarse ask'd for who, and good mens liues
-Expire before the Flowers in their Caps,
-Dying, or ere they sicken
-
-   Macd. Oh Relation; too nice, and yet too true
-
-   Malc. What's the newest griefe?
-  Rosse. That of an houres age, doth hisse the speaker,
-Each minute teemes a new one
-
-   Macd. How do's my Wife?
-  Rosse. Why well
-
-   Macd. And all my Children?
-  Rosse. Well too
-
-   Macd. The Tyrant ha's not batter'd at their peace?
-  Rosse. No, they were wel at peace, when I did leaue 'em
-  Macd. Be not a niggard of your speech: How gos't?
-  Rosse. When I came hither to transport the Tydings
-Which I haue heauily borne, there ran a Rumour
-Of many worthy Fellowes, that were out,
-Which was to my beleefe witnest the rather,
-For that I saw the Tyrants Power a-foot.
-Now is the time of helpe: your eye in Scotland
-Would create Soldiours, make our women fight,
-To doffe their dire distresses
-
-   Malc. Bee't their comfort
-We are comming thither: Gracious England hath
-Lent vs good Seyward, and ten thousand men,
-An older, and a better Souldier, none
-That Christendome giues out
-
-   Rosse. Would I could answer
-This comfort with the like. But I haue words
-That would be howl'd out in the desert ayre,
-Where hearing should not latch them
-
-   Macd. What concerne they,
-The generall cause, or is it a Fee-griefe
-Due to some single brest?
-  Rosse. No minde that's honest
-But in it shares some woe, though the maine part
-Pertaines to you alone
-
-   Macd. If it be mine
-Keepe it not from me, quickly let me haue it
-
-   Rosse. Let not your eares dispise my tongue for euer,
-Which shall possesse them with the heauiest sound
-that euer yet they heard
-
-   Macd. Humh: I guesse at it
-
-   Rosse. Your Castle is surpriz'd: your Wife, and Babes
-Sauagely slaughter'd: To relate the manner
-Were on the Quarry of these murther'd Deere
-To adde the death of you
-
-   Malc. Mercifull Heauen:
-What man, ne're pull your hat vpon your browes:
-Giue sorrow words; the griefe that do's not speake,
-Whispers the o're-fraught heart, and bids it breake
-
-   Macd. My Children too?
-  Ro. Wife, Children, Seruants, all that could be found
-
-   Macd. And I must be from thence? My wife kil'd too?
-  Rosse. I haue said
-
-   Malc. Be comforted.
-Let's make vs Med'cines of our great Reuenge,
-To cure this deadly greefe
-
-   Macd. He ha's no Children. All my pretty ones?
-Did you say All? Oh Hell-Kite! All?
-What, All my pretty Chickens, and their Damme
-At one fell swoope?
-  Malc. Dispute it like a man
-
-   Macd. I shall do so:
-But I must also feele it as a man;
-I cannot but remember such things were
-That were most precious to me: Did heauen looke on,
-And would not take their part? Sinfull Macduff,
-They were all strooke for thee: Naught that I am,
-Not for their owne demerits, but for mine
-Fell slaughter on their soules: Heauen rest them now
-
-   Mal. Be this the Whetstone of your sword, let griefe
-Conuert to anger: blunt not the heart, enrage it
-
-   Macd. O I could play the woman with mine eyes,
-And Braggart with my tongue. But gentle Heauens,
-Cut short all intermission: Front to Front,
-Bring thou this Fiend of Scotland, and my selfe
-Within my Swords length set him, if he scape
-Heauen forgiue him too
-
-   Mal. This time goes manly:
-Come go we to the King, our Power is ready,
-Our lacke is nothing but our leaue. Macbeth
-Is ripe for shaking, and the Powres aboue
-Put on their Instruments: Receiue what cheere you may,
-The Night is long, that neuer findes the Day.
-
-Exeunt.
-
-Actus Quintus. Scena Prima.
-
-Enter a Doctor of Physicke, and a Wayting Gentlewoman.
-
-  Doct. I haue too Nights watch'd with you, but can
-perceiue no truth in your report. When was it shee last
-walk'd?
-  Gent. Since his Maiesty went into the Field, I haue
-seene her rise from her bed, throw her Night-Gown vppon
-her, vnlocke her Closset, take foorth paper, folde it,
-write vpon't, read it, afterwards Seale it, and againe returne
-to bed; yet all this while in a most fast sleepe
-
-   Doct. A great perturbation in Nature, to receyue at
-once the benefit of sleep, and do the effects of watching.
-In this slumbry agitation, besides her walking, and other
-actuall performances, what (at any time) haue you heard
-her say?
-  Gent. That Sir, which I will not report after her
-
-   Doct. You may to me, and 'tis most meet you should
-
-   Gent. Neither to you, nor any one, hauing no witnesse
-to confirme my speech.
-Enter Lady, with a Taper.
-
-Lo you, heere she comes: This is her very guise, and vpon
-my life fast asleepe: obserue her, stand close
-
-   Doct. How came she by that light?
-  Gent. Why it stood by her: she ha's light by her continually,
-'tis her command
-
-   Doct. You see her eyes are open
-
-   Gent. I, but their sense are shut
-
-   Doct. What is it she do's now?
-Looke how she rubbes her hands
-
-   Gent. It is an accustom'd action with her, to seeme
-thus washing her hands: I haue knowne her continue in
-this a quarter of an houre
-
-   Lad. Yet heere's a spot
-
-   Doct. Heark, she speaks, I will set downe what comes
-from her, to satisfie my remembrance the more strongly
-
-   La. Out damned spot: out I say. One: Two: Why
-then 'tis time to doo't: Hell is murky. Fye, my Lord, fie,
-a Souldier, and affear'd? what need we feare? who knowes
-it, when none can call our powre to accompt: yet who
-would haue thought the olde man to haue had so much
-blood in him
-
-   Doct. Do you marke that?
-  Lad. The Thane of Fife, had a wife: where is she now?
-What will these hands ne're be cleane? No more o'that
-my Lord, no more o'that: you marre all with this starting
-
-   Doct. Go too, go too:
-You haue knowne what you should not
-
-   Gent. She ha's spoke what shee should not, I am sure
-of that: Heauen knowes what she ha's knowne
-
-   La. Heere's the smell of the blood still: all the perfumes
-of Arabia will not sweeten this little hand.
-Oh, oh, oh
-
-   Doct. What a sigh is there? The hart is sorely charg'd
-
-   Gent. I would not haue such a heart in my bosome,
-for the dignity of the whole body
-
-   Doct. Well, well, well
-
-   Gent. Pray God it be sir
-
-   Doct. This disease is beyond my practise: yet I haue
-knowne those which haue walkt in their sleep, who haue
-dyed holily in their beds
-
-   Lad. Wash your hands, put on your Night-Gowne,
-looke not so pale: I tell you yet againe Banquo's buried;
-he cannot come out on's graue
-
-   Doct. Euen so?
-  Lady. To bed, to bed: there's knocking at the gate:
-Come, come, come, come, giue me your hand: What's
-done, cannot be vndone. To bed, to bed, to bed.
-
-Exit Lady.
-
-  Doct. Will she go now to bed?
-  Gent. Directly
-
-   Doct. Foule whisp'rings are abroad: vnnaturall deeds
-Do breed vnnaturall troubles: infected mindes
-To their deafe pillowes will discharge their Secrets:
-More needs she the Diuine, then the Physitian:
-God, God forgiue vs all. Looke after her,
-Remoue from her the meanes of all annoyance,
-And still keepe eyes vpon her: So goodnight,
-My minde she ha's mated, and amaz'd my sight.
-I thinke, but dare not speake
-
-   Gent. Good night good Doctor.
-
-Exeunt.
-
-
-Scena Secunda.

-Drum and Colours. Enter Menteth, Cathnes, Angus, Lenox,
-Soldiers.
-
-  Ment. The English powre is neere, led on by Malcolm,
-His Vnkle Seyward, and the good Macduff.
-Reuenges burne in them: for their deere causes
-Would to the bleeding, and the grim Alarme
-Excite the mortified man
-
-   Ang. Neere Byrnan wood
-Shall we well meet them, that way are they comming
-
-   Cath. Who knowes if Donalbane be with his brother?
-  Len. For certaine Sir, he is not: I haue a File
-Of all the Gentry; there is Seywards Sonne,
-And many vnruffe youths, that euen now
-Protest their first of Manhood
-
-   Ment. What do's the Tyrant
-
-   Cath. Great Dunsinane he strongly Fortifies:
-Some say hee's mad: Others, that lesser hate him,
-Do call it valiant Fury, but for certaine
-He cannot buckle his distemper'd cause
-Within the belt of Rule
-
-   Ang. Now do's he feele
-His secret Murthers sticking on his hands,
-Now minutely Reuolts vpbraid his Faith-breach:
-Those he commands, moue onely in command,
-Nothing in loue: Now do's he feele his Title
-Hang loose about him, like a Giants Robe
-Vpon a dwarfish Theefe
-
-   Ment. Who then shall blame
-His pester'd Senses to recoyle, and start,
-When all that is within him, do's condemne
-It selfe, for being there
-
-   Cath. Well, march we on,
-To giue Obedience, where 'tis truly ow'd:
-Meet we the Med'cine of the sickly Weale,
-And with him poure we in our Countries purge,
-Each drop of vs
-
-   Lenox. Or so much as it needes,
-To dew the Soueraigne Flower, and drowne the Weeds:
-Make we our March towards Birnan.
-
-Exeunt. marching.
-
-
-Scaena Tertia.
-
-Enter Macbeth, Doctor, and Attendants.
-
-  Macb. Bring me no more Reports, let them flye all:
-Till Byrnane wood remoue to Dunsinane,
-I cannot taint with Feare. What's the Boy Malcolme?
-Was he not borne of woman? The Spirits that know
-All mortall Consequences, haue pronounc'd me thus:
-Feare not Macbeth, no man that's borne of woman
-Shall ere haue power vpon thee. Then fly false Thanes,
-And mingle with the English Epicures,
-The minde I sway by, and the heart I beare,
-Shall neuer sagge with doubt, nor shake with feare.
-Enter Seruant.
-
-The diuell damne thee blacke, thou cream-fac'd Loone:
-Where got'st thou that Goose-looke
-
-   Ser. There is ten thousand
-
-   Macb. Geese Villaine?
-  Ser. Souldiers Sir
-
-   Macb. Go pricke thy face, and ouer-red thy feare
-Thou Lilly-liuer'd Boy. What Soldiers, Patch?
-Death of thy Soule, those Linnen cheekes of thine
-Are Counsailers to feare. What Soldiers Whay-face?
-  Ser. The English Force, so please you
-
-   Macb. Take thy face hence. Seyton, I am sick at hart,
-When I behold: Seyton, I say, this push
-Will cheere me euer, or dis-eate me now.
-I haue liu'd long enough: my way of life
-Is falne into the Seare, the yellow Leafe,
-And that which should accompany Old-Age,
-As Honor, Loue, Obedience, Troopes of Friends,
-I must not looke to haue: but in their steed,
-Curses, not lowd but deepe, Mouth-honor, breath
-Which the poore heart would faine deny, and dare not.
-Seyton?
-Enter Seyton.
-
-  Sey. What's your gracious pleasure?
-  Macb. What Newes more?
-  Sey. All is confirm'd my Lord, which was reported
-
-   Macb. Ile fight, till from my bones, my flesh be hackt.
-Giue me my Armor
-
-   Seyt. 'Tis not needed yet
-
-   Macb. Ile put it on:
-Send out moe Horses, skirre the Country round,
-Hang those that talke of Feare. Giue me mine Armor:
-How do's your Patient, Doctor?
-  Doct. Not so sicke my Lord,
-As she is troubled with thicke-comming Fancies
-That keepe her from her rest
-
-   Macb. Cure of that:
-Can'st thou not Minister to a minde diseas'd,
-Plucke from the Memory a rooted Sorrow,
-Raze out the written troubles of the Braine,
-And with some sweet Obliuious Antidote
-Cleanse the stufft bosome, of that perillous stuffe
-Which weighes vpon the heart?
-  Doct. Therein the Patient
-Must minister to himselfe
-
-   Macb. Throw Physicke to the Dogs, Ile none of it.
-Come, put mine Armour on: giue me my Staffe:
-Seyton, send out: Doctor, the Thanes flye from me:
-Come sir, dispatch. If thou could'st Doctor, cast
-The Water of my Land, finde her Disease,
-And purge it to a sound and pristine Health,
-I would applaud thee to the very Eccho,
-That should applaud againe. Pull't off I say,
-What Rubarb, Cyme, or what Purgatiue drugge
-Would scowre these English hence: hear'st y of them?
-  Doct. I my good Lord: your Royall Preparation
-Makes vs heare something
-
-   Macb. Bring it after me:
-I will not be affraid of Death and Bane,
-Till Birnane Forrest come to Dunsinane
-
-   Doct. Were I from Dunsinane away, and cleere,
-Profit againe should hardly draw me heere.

-That Chambers will be safe
-
-   Ment. We doubt it nothing
-
-   Seyw. What wood is this before vs?
-  Ment. The wood of Birnane
-
-   Malc. Let euery Souldier hew him downe a Bough,
-And bear't before him, thereby shall we shadow
-The numbers of our Hoast, and make discouery
-Erre in report of vs
-
-   Sold. It shall be done
-
-   Syw. We learne no other, but the confident Tyrant
-Keepes still in Dunsinane, and will indure
-Our setting downe befor't
-
-   Malc. 'Tis his maine hope:
-For where there is aduantage to be giuen,
-Both more and lesse haue giuen him the Reuolt,
-And none serue with him, but constrained things,
-Whose hearts are absent too
-
-   Macd. Let our iust Censures
-Attend the true euent, and put we on
-Industrious Souldiership
-
-   Sey. The time approaches,
-That will with due decision make vs know
-What we shall say we haue, and what we owe:
-Thoughts speculatiue, their vnsure hopes relate,
-But certaine issue, stroakes must arbitrate,
-Towards which, aduance the warre.
-
-Exeunt. marching
-
-Scena Quinta.
-
-Enter Macbeth, Seyton, & Souldiers, with Drum and Colours.
-
-  Macb. Hang out our Banners on the outward walls,
-The Cry is still, they come: our Castles strength
-Will laugh a Siedge to scorne: Heere let them lye,
-Till Famine and the Ague eate them vp:
-Were they not forc'd with those that should be ours,
-We might haue met them darefull, beard to beard,
-And beate them backward home. What is that noyse?
-
-A Cry within of Women.
-
-  Sey. It is the cry of women, my good Lord
-
-   Macb. I haue almost forgot the taste of Feares:
-The time ha's beene, my sences would haue cool'd
-To heare a Night-shrieke, and my Fell of haire
-Would at a dismall Treatise rowze, and stirre
-As life were in't. I haue supt full with horrors,
-Direnesse familiar to my slaughterous thoughts
-Cannot once start me. Wherefore was that cry?
-  Sey. The Queene (my Lord) is dead
-
-   Macb. She should haue dy'de heereafter;
-There would haue beene a time for such a word:
-To morrow, and to morrow, and to morrow,
-Creepes in this petty pace from day to day,
-To the last Syllable of Recorded time:
-And all our yesterdayes, haue lighted Fooles
-The way to dusty death. Out, out, breefe Candle,
-Life's but a walking Shadow, a poore Player,
-That struts and frets his houre vpon the Stage,
-And then is heard no more. It is a Tale
-Told by an Ideot, full of sound and fury
-Signifying nothing.
-Enter a Messenger.
-
-Thou com'st to vse thy Tongue: thy Story quickly
-
-   Mes. Gracious my Lord,
-I should report that which I say I saw,
-But know not how to doo't
-
-   Macb. Well, say sir
-
-   Mes. As I did stand my watch vpon the Hill
-I look'd toward Byrnane, and anon me thought
-The Wood began to moue
-
-   Macb. Lyar, and Slaue
-
-   Mes. Let me endure your wrath, if't be not so:
-Within this three Mile may you see it comming.
-I say, a mouing Groue
-
-   Macb. If thou speak'st false,
-Vpon the next Tree shall thou hang aliue
-Till Famine cling thee: If thy speech be sooth,
-I care not if thou dost for me as much.
-I pull in Resolution, and begin
-To doubt th' Equiuocation of the Fiend,
-That lies like truth. Feare not, till Byrnane Wood
-Do come to Dunsinane, and now a Wood
-Comes toward Dunsinane. Arme, Arme, and out,
-If this which he auouches, do's appeare,
-There is nor flying hence, nor tarrying here.
-I 'ginne to be a-weary of the Sun,
-And wish th' estate o'th' world were now vndon.
-Ring the Alarum Bell, blow Winde, come wracke,
-At least wee'l dye with Harnesse on our backe.
-
-Exeunt.

-And shew like those you are: You (worthy Vnkle)
-Shall with my Cosin your right Noble Sonne
-Leade our first Battell. Worthy Macduffe, and wee
-Shall take vpon's what else remaines to do,
-According to our order
-
-   Sey. Fare you well:
-Do we but finde the Tyrants power to night,
-Let vs be beaten, if we cannot fight
-
-   Macd. Make all our Trumpets speak, giue the[m] all breath
-Those clamorous Harbingers of Blood, & Death.
-
-Exeunt.
-
-Alarums continued.
-
-
-Scena Septima.
-
-Enter Macbeth.
-
-  Macb. They haue tied me to a stake, I cannot flye,
-But Beare-like I must fight the course. What's he
-That was not borne of Woman? Such a one
-Am I to feare, or none.
-Enter young Seyward.
-
-  Y.Sey. What is thy name?
-  Macb. Thou'lt be affraid to heare it
-
-   Y.Sey. No: though thou call'st thy selfe a hoter name
-Then any is in hell
-
-   Macb. My name's Macbeth
-
-   Y.Sey. The diuell himselfe could not pronounce a Title
-More hatefull to mine eare
-
-   Macb. No: nor more fearefull
-
-   Y.Sey. Thou lyest abhorred Tyrant, with my Sword
-Ile proue the lye thou speak'st.
-
-Fight, and young Seyward slaine.
-
-  Macb. Thou was't borne of woman;
-But Swords I smile at, Weapons laugh to scorne,
-Brandish'd by man that's of a Woman borne.
-Enter.
-
-Alarums. Enter Macduffe.
-
-  Macd. That way the noise is: Tyrant shew thy face,
-If thou beest slaine, and with no stroake of mine,
-My Wife and Childrens Ghosts will haunt me still:
-I cannot strike at wretched Kernes, whose armes
-Are hyr'd to beare their Staues; either thou Macbeth,
-Or else my Sword with an vnbattered edge
-I sheath againe vndeeded. There thou should'st be,
-By this great clatter, one of greatest note
-Seemes bruited. Let me finde him Fortune,
-And more I begge not.
-
-Exit. Alarums.
-
-Enter Malcolme and Seyward.
-
-  Sey. This way my Lord, the Castles gently rendred:
-The Tyrants people, on both sides do fight,
-The Noble Thanes do brauely in the Warre,
-The day almost it selfe professes yours,
-And little is to do
-
-   Malc. We haue met with Foes
-That strike beside vs
-
-   Sey. Enter Sir, the Castle.
-
-Exeunt. Alarum
-
-Enter Macbeth.
-
-  Macb. Why should I play the Roman Foole, and dye
-On mine owne sword? whiles I see liues, the gashes
-Do better vpon them.
-Enter Macduffe.
-
-  Macd. Turne Hell-hound, turne
-
-   Macb. Of all men else I haue auoyded thee:
-But get thee backe, my soule is too much charg'd
-With blood of thine already
-
-   Macd. I haue no words,
-My voice is in my Sword, thou bloodier Villaine
-Then tearmes can giue thee out.
-
-Fight: Alarum
-
-  Macb. Thou loosest labour
-As easie may'st thou the intrenchant Ayre
-With thy keene Sword impresse, as make me bleed:
-Let fall thy blade on vulnerable Crests,
-I beare a charmed Life, which must not yeeld
-To one of woman borne
-
-   Macd. Dispaire thy Charme,
-And let the Angell whom thou still hast seru'd
-Tell thee, Macduffe was from his Mothers womb
-Vntimely ript
-
-   Macb. Accursed be that tongue that tels mee so;
-For it hath Cow'd my better part of man:
-And be these Iugling Fiends no more beleeu'd,
-That palter with vs in a double sence,
-That keepe the word of promise to our eare,
-And breake it to our hope. Ile not fight with thee
-
-   Macd. Then yeeld thee Coward,
-And liue to be the shew, and gaze o'th' time.
-Wee'l haue thee, as our rarer Monsters are
-Painted vpon a pole, and vnder-writ,
-Heere may you see the Tyrant
-
-   Macb. I will not yeeld
-To kisse the ground before young Malcolmes feet,
-And to be baited with the Rabbles curse.
-Though Byrnane wood be come to Dunsinane,
-And thou oppos'd, being of no woman borne,
-Yet I will try the last. Before my body,
-I throw my warlike Shield: Lay on Macduffe,
-And damn'd be him, that first cries hold, enough.
-
-Exeunt. fighting. Alarums.
-
-Enter Fighting, and Macbeth slaine.
-
-Retreat, and Flourish. Enter with Drumme and Colours, Malcolm,
-Seyward,
-Rosse, Thanes, & Soldiers.
-
-  Mal. I would the Friends we misse, were safe arriu'd
-
-   Sey. Some must go off: and yet by these I see,
-So great a day as this is cheapely bought
-
-   Mal. Macduffe is missing, and your Noble Sonne
-
-   Rosse. Your son my Lord, ha's paid a souldiers debt,
-He onely liu'd but till he was a man,
-The which no sooner had his Prowesse confirm'd
-In the vnshrinking station where he fought,
-But like a man he dy'de
-
-   Sey. Then he is dead?
-  Rosse. I, and brought off the field: your cause of sorrow
-Must not be measur'd by his worth, for then
-It hath no end
-
-   Sey. Had he his hurts before?
-  Rosse. I, on the Front
-
-   Sey. Why then, Gods Soldier be he:
-Had I as many Sonnes, as I haue haires,
-I would not wish them to a fairer death:
-And so his Knell is knoll'd
-
-   Mal. Hee's worth more sorrow,
-and that Ile spend for him
-
-   Sey. He's worth no more,
-They say he parted well, and paid his score,
-And so God be with him. Here comes newer comfort.
-Enter Macduffe, with Macbeths head.
-
-  Macd. Haile King, for so thou art.
-Behold where stands
-Th' Vsurpers cursed head: the time is free:
-I see thee compast with thy Kingdomes Pearle,
-That speake my salutation in their minds:
-Whose voyces I desire alowd with mine.
-Haile King of Scotland
-
-   All. Haile King of Scotland.
-
-Flourish.
-
-  Mal. We shall not spend a large expence of time,
-Before we reckon with your seuerall loues,
-And make vs euen with you. My Thanes and Kinsmen
-Henceforth be Earles, the first that euer Scotland
-In such an Honor nam'd: What's more to do,
-Which would be planted newly with the time,
-As calling home our exil'd Friends abroad,
-That fled the Snares of watchfull Tyranny,
-Producing forth the cruell Ministers
-Of this dead Butcher, and his Fiend-like Queene;
-Who (as 'tis thought) by selfe and violent hands,
-Tooke off her life. This, and what need full else
-That call's vpon vs, by the Grace of Grace,
-We will performe in measure, time, and place:
-So thankes to all at once, and to each one,
-Whom we inuite, to see vs Crown'd at Scone.
-
-Flourish. Exeunt Omnes.
-
-
-FINIS. THE TRAGEDIE OF MACBETH.
