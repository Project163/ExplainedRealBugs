 As long as you override the `expand` method in your `PTransform` subclass to accept the appropriate input `PCollection`(s) and return the corresponding output `PCollection`(s), you can include as many transforms as you want. These transforms can include core transforms, composite transforms, or the transforms included in the Beam SDK libraries.

 This code sample sets a time-based trigger for a `PCollection`, which emits results one minute after the first element in that window has been processed. The last line in the code sample, `.discardingFiredPanes()`, is the window's **accumulation mode**.
