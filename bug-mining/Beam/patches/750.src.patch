 These kind of urgently required upgrades might not get automatically picked up by the Jenkins job for few months. So Beam community has to act to identify such issues and perform upgrades early.

+## JIRA Issue Automation
 
 In order to track the dependency upgrade process, JIRA tickets will be created per significant outdated dependency based on the report. A bot named *Beam Jira Bot* was created for managing JIRA issues. Beam community agrees on the following policies that creates and updates issues.
-* Issues will be named as "Beam Dependency Update Request: <dep_name> <dep_newest_version>".
-* Issues will be created under the component *"dependencies"*
-* Issues will be assigned to the primary owner of the dependencies, who are mentioned in the dependency ownership files. ([Java Dependency Owners](https://github.com/apache/beam/blob/master/ownership/JAVA_DEPENDENCY_OWNERS.yaml) and [Python Dependency Owners](https://github.com/apache/beam/blob/master/ownership/PYTHON_DEPENDENCY_OWNERS.yaml))
-* If more than one owners found for a dependency, the first owner will be picked as the primary owner, the others will be pinged in the issue's description.
-* If no owners found, leave the assignee empty. The component lead is responsible for triaging the issue.
-* Avoid creating duplicate issues. Updating the descriptions of the open issues created by the previous dependency check.
-* The dependency sometimes is not able to be upgraded, the issue should be closed as *"won't fix"*. And, the bot should avoid recreating issues with "won't fix".
+* Title (summary) of the issues will be in the format "Beam Dependency Update Request: <dep_name>" where <dep_name> is the dependency artifact name.
+* Issues will be created under the component *"dependencies"*.
+* Owners of dependencies will be notified by tagging the corresponding JIRA IDs mentioned in the ownership files in the issue description. See [Java Dependency Owners](https://github.com/apache/beam/blob/master/ownership/JAVA_DEPENDENCY_OWNERS.yaml) and [Python Dependency Owners](https://github.com/apache/beam/blob/master/ownership/PYTHON_DEPENDENCY_OWNERS.yaml) for current owners for Java SDK and Python SDK dependencies respectively.
+* Automated tool will not create duplicate issues for the same dependency. Instead the tool will look for an existing JIRA when one has to be created for a given dependency and description of the JIRA will be updated with latest information, for example, current version of the dependency.
+* If a Beam community member determines that a given dependency should not be upgraded the corresponding JIRA issue can be closed with a fix version specified.
+* Automated tool will reopen a JIRA for a given dependency when one of following conditions is met:
+  * Next SDK release is for a fix version mentioned in the JIRA. 
+  * Six months __and__ three or more minor releases have passed since the JIRA was closed.
