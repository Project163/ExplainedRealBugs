 The samples on this page show you common Beam side input patterns. A side input is an additional input that your `DoFn` can access each time it processes an element in the input `PCollection`. For more information, see the [programming guide section on side inputs]({{ site.baseurl }}/documentation/programming-guide/#side-inputs).

 ## Slowly updating side input using windowing
 
-You can read side input pcollection periodically into distinct windows.
-Later, when you apply side input to your main input, windows will be matched automatically 1:1.
-This way, you can guarantee side input consistency on the duration of the single window.
-
-To do this, you can utilize PeriodicSequence PTransform that will generate infinite sequence
-of elements with some real-time period:

+You can read side input data periodically into distinct PCollection windows.
+When you apply the side input to your main input, each main input
+window is automatically matched to a single side input window.
+This guarantees consistency on the duration of the single window,
