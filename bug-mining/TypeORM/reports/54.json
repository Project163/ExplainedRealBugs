This would enable similar workaround to database-specific feature definitions (i.e. in #1519  an backend-specific index is created which is not synchronized by typeorm directly).\r\n\r\nUntil #3996 were ready, we could construct the view in a migration and not synchronize it so that we could use the materialize view as a typeorm ViewEntity.\r\n\r\n```ts\r\n// migration\r\n...\r\nquery(`\r\n  create materialized view mymaterializedview as select 1 as id;\r\n`)\r\n...\r\n\r\n// materialized view\r\n@ViewEntity('mymaterializedview', { synchronize: false })\r\nclass MyMaterializedView {\r\n  @ViewColumn()\r\n  id: string\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAlso note that for this to work, naturally you'd have to specify the name of the view in the ViewEntity definition which I don't believe is currently being done either.","closed_by":{"login":"pleerock","id":1753397,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NTMzOTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1753397?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pleerock","html_url":"https://github.com/pleerock","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pleerock/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pleerock/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pleerock/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pleerock/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pleerock/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pleerock/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pleerock/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pleerock/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pleerock/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/typeorm/typeorm/issues/4317/reactions","total_count":5,"+1":5,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/typeorm/typeorm/issues/4317/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
