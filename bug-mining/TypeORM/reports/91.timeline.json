One could then add useful comments to queries, like, ID of function calls to be able to trace where SQL query originated from.\r\n\r\nPostgesql and MySQL both support adding comment anywhere in the SQL query using multline comments `/* */`, but not sure about other drivers that are used in TypeORM. From what I understand queries are not formated in TypeORM when they are sent to the database, so the multiline comment could be added to the beginning or end of the SQL query.\r\n\r\nI'm willing to add this functionality, but would it require adding support for it for all database drivers in TypeORM, or just MySQL and Postgresql would be good enough?\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/typeorm/typeorm/issues/6128/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/typeorm/typeorm/issues/6128/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/typeorm/typeorm/issues/comments/706807465","html_url":"https://github.com/typeorm/typeorm/issues/3643#issuecomment-706807465","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/typeorm/typeorm/issues/3643","id":706807465,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDcwNjgwNzQ2NQ==","user":{"login":"imnotjames","id":1551593,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1NTE1OTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1551593?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/imnotjames","html_url":"https://github.com/imnotjames","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imnotjames/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imnotjames/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imnotjames/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imnotjames/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imnotjames/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imnotjames/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imnotjames/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imnotjames/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imnotjames/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-10-12T01:28:14Z","updated_at":"2020-10-12T01:32:21Z","body":"I'm going to implement this.
