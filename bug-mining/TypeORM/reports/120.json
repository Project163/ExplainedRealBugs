I imagine this to be a common occurrence. Since we have a `uuid` column in at least 1 of our entities, this line runs https://github.com/typeorm/typeorm/blob/master/src/driver/postgres/PostgresDriver.ts#L336-L341:\r\n\r\n```\r\nif (hasUuidColumns)\r\n            try {\r\n                await this.executeQuery(connection, `CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS \"${this.options.uuidExtension || \"uuid-ossp\"}\"`);\r\n            } catch (_) {\r\n                logger.log(\"warn\", `At least one of the entities has uuid column, but the '${this.options.uuidExtension || \"uuid-ossp\"}' extension cannot be installed automatically. Please install it manually using superuser rights, or select another uuid extension.`);\r\n            }\r\n```\r\n\r\nAlthough there is no _real_ issue, we are being bombarded with logs from both Postgres and the App especially on those that periodically go up and down (think crons) \r\n\r\n### The Solution\r\n\r\nOne of the ways this can be solved by adding a flag at the start of the function to determine whether it should run or not. There are many (possibly better) ways to achieve this same effect.\r\n\r\n### Considered Alternatives\r\n\r\nAdd a flag somewhere else to disable automatically running a `CREATE EXTENSION` script\r\n\r\n### Additional Context\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n  Add any other context about the feature request here.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### Relevant Database Driver(s)\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n  Please include the relevant database drivers to your feature, if any.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n- [ ] `aurora-data-api`\r\n- [ ] `aurora-data-api-pg`\r\n- [ ] `better-sqlite3`\r\n- [ ] `cockroachdb`\r\n- [ ] `cordova`\r\n- [ ] `expo`\r\n- [ ] `mongodb`\r\n- [ ] `mysql`\r\n- [ ] `nativescript`\r\n- [ ] `oracle`\r\n- [x] `postgres`\r\n- [ ] `react-native`\r\n- [ ] `sap`\r\n- [ ] `sqlite`\r\n- [ ] `sqlite-abstract`\r\n- [ ] `sqljs`\r\n- [ ] `sqlserver`\r\n\r\n\r\n### Are you willing to resolve this issue by submitting a Pull Request?\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n  Remember that first-time contributors are welcome! 🙌\r\n-->\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes, I have the time, and I know how to start.\r\n- [ ] Yes, I have the time, but I don't know how to start.
