was having this same issue with several columns in multiple tables. It turns out that some data types require precision attributes for the migrations to work correctly. The clue is in your up and down methods: 'down' tells you the SQL clauses that run if the migration is reverted and returned to its previous state. Before running the migration, your dates are of type \"datetime(0)\", and your up method tries to alter it to \"datetime\" without (0). However, if you run the migration MySQL presumably runs these dates as \"datetime(0)\" under the hood, causing TypeORM to think that the database is different than what is defined in the schema.\r\n\r\nTry this:\r\n\r\n```\r\n    @Column({type: \"datetime\", precision:0})\r\n    public date1: Date;\r\n\r\n    @Column({type: \"datetime\", precision:0, nullable:true})\r\n    public date2: Date;\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nGenerate a new migration and run it. TypeORM should no longer detect a schema change if you try to generate another migration.\r\n\r\nI've had similar issues with floats and decimals as well, so keep that in mind when you create columns with those types.","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/typeorm/typeorm/issues/comments/422084386/reactions","total_count":4,"+1":4,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"HenryKari","id":43349359,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzMzQ5MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/43349359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HenryKari","html_url":"https://github.com/HenryKari","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HenryKari/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HenryKari/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HenryKari/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HenryKari/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HenryKari/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HenryKari/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HenryKari/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HenryKari/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HenryKari/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":1850251749,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MTg1MDI1MTc0OQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/typeorm/typeorm/issues/events/1850251749","actor":{"login":"column-zz","id":27595142,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3NTk1MTQy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/27595142?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/column-zz","html_url":"https://github.com/column-zz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/column-zz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/column-zz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/column-zz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/column-zz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/column-zz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/column-zz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/column-zz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/column-zz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/column-zz/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-09-17T16:35:44Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":1850251750,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDE4NTAyNTE3NTA=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/typeorm/typeorm/issues/events/1850251750","actor":{"login":"column-zz","id":27595142,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3NTk1MTQy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/27595142?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/column-zz","html_url":"https://github.com/column-zz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/column-zz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/column-zz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/column-zz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/column-zz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/column-zz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/column-zz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/column-zz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/column-zz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/column-zz/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-09-17T16:35:44Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":1875112727,"node_id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDE4NzUxMTI3Mjc=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/typeorm/typeorm/issues/events/1875112727","actor":{"login":"Kononnable","id":9082099,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkwODIwOTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9082099?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kononnable","html_url":"https://github.com/Kononnable","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kononnable/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kononnable/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kononnable/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kononnable/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kononnable/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kononnable/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kononnable/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kononnable/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kononnable/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-09-29T21:34:20Z","label":{"name":"bug","color":"fc2929"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":1875112728,"node_id":"MDEyOkxhY

your version here)\r\n\r\n**Steps to reproduce or a small repository showing the problem:**\r\nAdd an following entity to existing TypeORM projecT:\r\n\r\n```\r\nimport { Column, Entity, Index, JoinColumn, ManyToOne, PrimaryGeneratedColumn } from \"typeorm\";\r\nimport { User } from \"./User\";\r\n\r\n@Entity()\r\nexport class Session {\r\n    @PrimaryGeneratedColumn()\r\n    public id: number;\r\n\r\n    @ManyToOne(() => User)\r\n    @JoinColumn()\r\n    public user: User;\r\n\r\n    @Column({type: \"char\", precision: 64, nullable: false})\r\n    @Index({unique: true})\r\n    public sessionId: string;\r\n\r\n    @Column()\r\n    public validTo: Date;\r\n\r\n    @Column()\r\n    public lastActive: Date;\r\n }\r\n\r\n```\r\nGenerate a migration using:\r\n\r\n> ts-node ../../../node_modules/.bin/typeorm migration:generate -n AnyName\r\n\r\nIt will produce initial migration that contains Session table creation. Then run the migration as:\r\n> ts-node ../../../node_modules/.bin/typeorm migration:run\r\n\r\nAnd then re-run the migration generation\r\n> ts-node ../../../node_modules/.bin/typeorm migration:generate -n AnyName2\r\n\r\nResult of that will be migration that regenerates sessionId **column**.  If the entity lacks precision specifier, and the above scenario is re-ran it will produce no second **AnyName2** migration.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe issue is similar to these ones where the precision triggers non existing difference observation by the migration
