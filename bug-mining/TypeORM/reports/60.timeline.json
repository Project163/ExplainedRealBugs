#5160\r\n\r\nWhen inserting or updating an entity, `QueryBuilder` was using SQL Server's `OUTPUT` clause to return updated values for columns with generated or default values and then update the entity representation.\r\n\r\nThis breaks when the target table has a trigger defined, with the following error:\r\n\r\n```\r\nThe target table '...' of the DML statement cannot have any enabled triggers\r\nif the statement contains an OUTPUT clause without INTO clause.\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis PR changes the behavior of `QueryBuilder` (when connected to SQL Server) to use `OUTPUT INTO` instead of just `OUTPUT`, so the returned values are inserted to a table variable and then selected back, rather than returned directly from the `INSERT` statement.\r\n\r\nSQL Server reference:
