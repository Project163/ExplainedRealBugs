While the typeorm CLI does allow to specify a `transaction` argument on the `migration:run` command, this argument applies globally. This poses a problem when migrations are ran in a CI pipeline where we don't want to completely abandon the guarantees that wrapping a migration in a transaction gives us (safe rollback if something shall go wrong) and leaves no other resource other than running some migrations manually\r\n\r\n### The Solution\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n  A clear and concise description of what you want to happen.\r\n\r\n  How can the requested feature be used to approach the problem it's supposed to solve?\r\n-->\r\n\r\nWhen running a migration the `MigrationExecutor` checks if the migration class defines a value for the transaction property in order to decide if this particular migration should be wrapped in a transaction or not. This value should take precedence over the `transaction` property of the `MigrationExecutor`.\r\n\r\nThere is an issue if the transaction argument is `'all'` ie. all migrations should be executed within a single transaction, as there is no clear cut way to conciliate it with some migrations wanting to be ran outside transactions, so maybe the `Migration`'s transaction property should only be honored if the `MigrationExecutor`'s transaction is either `'each'` in which case if a migration has `transaction = false` it is not wrapped in a migration, or `MigrationExecutor`'s transaction is `'none'` in which case only migrations which explicitly state it are wrapped in transactions.\r\n\r\n### Considered Alternatives\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n  A clear and concise description of any alternative solutions\r\n  or features you've considered.\r\n\r\n  If any workaround exists to the best of your knowledge, include it here.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### Additional Context\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n  Add any other context about the feature request here.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### Relevant Database Driver(s)\r\n\r\n- [ ] `aurora-data-api`\r\n- [ ] `aurora-data-api-pg`\r\n- [ ] `better-sqlite3`\r\n- [ ] `cockroachdb`\r\n- [ ] `cordova`\r\n- [ ] `expo`\r\n- [ ] `mongodb`\r\n- [ ] `mysql`\r\n- [ ] `nativescript`\r\n- [ ] `oracle`\r\n- [x] `postgres`\r\n- [ ] `react-native`\r\n- [ ] `sap`\r\n- [ ] `sqlite`\r\n- [ ] `sqlite-abstract`\r\n- [ ] `sqljs`\r\n- [ ] `sqlserver`\r\n\r\n\r\n### Are you willing to resolve this issue by submitting a Pull Request?\r\n\r\n- [x] Yes, I have the time, and I know how to start.\r\n- [ ] Yes, I have the time, but I don't know how to start.
