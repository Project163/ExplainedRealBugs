your version here)\r\n\r\n**Related to:**\r\n\r\n#3271\r\n\r\n**Steps to reproduce or a small repository showing the problem:**\r\n\r\nI recently switched our update method to use `repository.update()` instead of `repository.save()` to prevent the needless extra `SELECT` before `UPDATE`.\r\n\r\n**pizza-route.ts**\r\n```ts\r\n@JsonController('/pizzas')\r\nexport class PizzaController {\r\n  private readonly pizzaRepository: Repository<Pizza>;\r\n\r\n  constructor() {\r\n    const connection: Connection = getConnectionManager().get();\r\n    this.pizzaRepository = connection.getRepository<Pizza>(Pizza);\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  @Put('/:id')\r\n  async put(@Param('id') id: number, @EntityFromBody({ required: true }) pizza: Pizza) {\r\n    /* before */\r\n    // return this.pizzaRepository.save(pizza);\r\n\r\n    /* after */\r\n    return this.pizzaRepository.update(id, pizza).then((res: UpdateResult) => {\r\n      console.log(res); // always empty { generatedMaps: [], raw: [] }\r\n      return pizza; // can't return updated DB object\r\n   });\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nI was surprised by two things:\r\n\r\n1. It started throwing this same error from #3271:\r\n\r\n  `multiple assignments to same column \\\"updatedAt\\\"`. \r\n\r\n  I thought adding the `readonly` flag:\r\n\r\n  ```ts\r\n  @UpdateDateColumn({ readonly: true }) updatedAt: Date;\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n  would fix the problem, but the `repository.update()` method appears to ignore the `readonly` flag for the `UpdateDateColumn()` and `CreateDateColumn()`.\r\n\r\n2. The `repository.update()` method does not give access to the updated DB value like `repository.save()` does. I expected to see the query like:\r\n\r\n  ```sql\r\n  UPDATE \"pizza\" SET \"name\" = $2, \"updatedAt\" = CURRENT_TIMESTAMP WHERE \"id\" = $1 RETURNING *\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n  but the query was\r\n\r\n  ```sql\r\n  UPDATE \"pizza\" SET \"id\" = $2, \"name\" = $3, \"updatedAt\" = $4, \"updatedAt\" = CURRENT_TIMESTAMP WHERE \"id\" = $1\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n  with no `RETURNING *`. The `UpdateResult` doesn't contain the updated record from the DB and in my testing it's always completely empty:\r\n\r\n  ```js\r\n  {\r\n    generatedMaps: [],\r\n    raw: []\r\n  }\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n  so even if the error wasn't occurring, I wouldn't be able to send a return object with the new `updatedAt` value or any other DB-calculated values back to the client without performing a subsequent `SELECT`","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/typeorm/typeorm/issues/3365/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/typeorm/typeorm/issues/3365/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"actor":{"login":"vlapo","id":2484063,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0ODQwNjM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2484063?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vlapo","html_url":"https://github.com/vlapo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vlapo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vlapo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vlapo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vlapo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vlapo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vlapo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vlapo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vlapo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vlapo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-02-14T21:05:47Z","updated_at":"2019-02-14T21:05:47Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/typeorm/typeorm/issues/3627","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/typeorm/typeorm","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/typeorm/typeorm/issues/3627/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/typeorm/typeorm/issues/3627/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/typeorm/typeorm/issues/3627/events","html_url":"https://github.com/typeorm/typeorm/issues/3627","id":409393486,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU0MDkzOTM0ODY=","number":3627,"title":"set
