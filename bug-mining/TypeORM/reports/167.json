Both strategies have their own cons and pros.\n>\n>One thing we should always keep in mind with software development is how we are going to maintain our applications. The Data Mapper approach helps with maintainability, which is more effective in larger apps. The Active Record approach helps keep things simple which works well in smaller apps. And simplicity is always a key to better maintainability.\n\nThe last sentence is really confusing: the Active Record approach is better for maintainability (because it is simpler) and the Active Record is also better for maintainability (i.e. it \"helps with maintainability\").\n\nThis does not make much sense.\n\n### Recommended Fix\n\n I propose that this last sentence is removed. People that prefers simplicity will choose Active Record; people that prefer maintainability will choose Data Mapper. It seems enough.\n\n### Additional Context\n\n_No response_\n\n### Are you willing to resolve this issue by submitting a Pull Request?\n\nYes, I have the time, and I know how to start.","closed_by":{"login":"sgarner","id":904004,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkwNDAwNA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/904004?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgarner","html_url":"https://github.com/sgarner","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgarner/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgarner/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgarner/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgarner/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgarner/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgarner/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgarner/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgarner/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sgarner/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/typeorm/typeorm/issues/11715/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/typeorm/typeorm/issues/11715/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
