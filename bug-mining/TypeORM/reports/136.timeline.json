Description of change\r\nAdd `typeorm-ts-node-commonjs` and `typeorm-ts-node-esm` CLI commands.\r\nThis removes the need to manually write `node --require ts-node/register ./node_modules/typeorm/cli.js` or `node --loader ts-node/esm ./node_modules/typeorm/cli.js` in order to use TypeORM CLI without transpiling the code in advance.\r\n\r\nThis is more useful now than before since the new CLI in version 0.3 requires you to specify a file path instead of just a file name, so being able to `cd` to a folder and then run a simple and intuitive command is now more important.\r\n\r\nPrevious usage of the CLI in version 0.3:\r\n```bash\r\ncd src/db/migrations\r\nnode --loader ts-node/esm ../../../node_modules/typeorm/cli.js migration:generate -d ../data-source.ts --pretty SomeMigrationName\r\n```\r\n\r\nNew possible usage of the CLI:\r\n```bash\r\ncd src/db/migrations\r\nnpx typeorm-ts-node-esm migration:generate -d ../data-source.ts --pretty SomeMigrationName\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Pull-Request Checklist\r\n- [x] Code is up-to-date with the `master` branch\r\n- [x] `npm run format` to apply prettier formatting\r\n- [x] `npm run test` passes

I have tried just running the following command:\r\n\r\n`typeorm migration:generate -n PostRefactoring`\r\n\r\nWhen I run this command I get the following:\r\n\r\n`Not enough non-option arguments: got 0, need at least 1`\r\n\r\nSo then I modify the command to something like this:\r\n\r\n`Missing required argument: dataSource`\r\n\r\nSo then from there I add the datasource since that is what it is asking for:\r\n\r\n`npx typeorm migration:generate test -d app-data-source.ts` (I found the -d somewhere online  while investigating this issue)\r\n\r\nBut once I run that command I get the following error:\r\n\r\n`File must contain a TypeScript / JavaScript code and export a DataSource instance.`\r\n\r\nI have been trying to get this to work for days and I am about ready to throw the towl in and use a different ORM...which I don't want to do. I know that everything is working fine because I can start up the app and the app connects to the database and creates rows in the database. So it is just something with the cli and trying to generate the migrations.\r\n\r\nHere is what is in my app-data-source.ts file:\r\n\r\n```\r\nimport { DataSource } from \"typeorm\";\r\nimport { User } from \"./entitiy/User\";\r\n\r\nconst myDataSource = new DataSource({\r\n  type: \"postgres\",\r\n  host: \"localhost\",\r\n  port: 5432,\r\n  username: \"postgres\",\r\n  password: \"\",\r\n  database: \"postgres\",\r\n  entities: [User],\r\n  migrations: [\"/migrations/\"],\r\n  logging: true,\r\n  synchronize: true,\r\n});\r\n\r\n\r\nexport default myDataSource;\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is the contents of my app.ts file:\r\n\r\n```\r\nimport * as express from \"express\";\r\nimport { Request, Response } from \"express\";\r\nimport myDataSource from \"./app-data-source\";\r\nimport { User } from \"./entitiy/User\";\r\n\r\n// establish database connection\r\nmyDataSource\r\n  .initialize()\r\n  .then(() => {\r\n    console.log(\"Data Source has been initialized!\");\r\n  })\r\n  .catch((err) => {\r\n    console.error(\"Error during Data Source initialization:\", err);\r\n  });\r\n\r\n// create and setup express app\r\nconst app = express();\r\napp.use(express.json());\r\n\r\n// register routes\r\napp.get(\"/users\", async function (req: Request, res: Response) {\r\n  const users = await myDataSource.getRepository(User).find();\r\n  res.json(users);\r\n});\r\n\r\napp.get(\"/users/:id\", async function (req: Request, res: Response) {\r\n  const results = await myDataSource.getRepository(User).findOneBy({\r\n    id: +req.params.id,\r\n  });\r\n  return res.send(results);\r\n});\r\n\r\napp.post(\"/users\", async function (req: Request, res: Response) {\r\n  const user = await myDataSource.getRepository(User).create(req.body);\r\n  const results = await myDataSource.getRepository(User).save(user);\r\n  return res.send(results);\r\n});\r\n\r\napp.put(\"/users/:id\", async function (req: Request, res: Response) {\r\n  const user = await myDataSource.getRepository(User).findOneBy({\r\n    id: +req.params.id,\r\n  });\r\n  myDataSource.getRepository(User).merge(user, req.body);\r\n  const results = await myDataSource.getRepository(User).save(user);\r\n  return res.send(results);\r\n});\r\n\r\napp.delete(\"/users/:id\", async function (req: Request, res: Response) {\r\n  const results = await myDataSource.getRepository(User).delete(req.params.id);\r\n  return res.send(results);\r\n});\r\n\r\n// start express server\r\napp.listen(3000);\r\n```\r\n\r\nAll these files were setup using the instructions outlined in the express typeorm documentation:\r\n[Example with Express](https://typeorm.io/example-with-express)\r\n\r\nWhich BTW, this also has issues and doesn't run from what is outlined in the directions. I had to make some modifications to actually make the app run compared to what is outlined in that guide. One of the changes I made in the data source file was putting the actual Entity name in the entity property of the datasource compared to the guide that has you put the path in.\r\n\r\nAnyway, am I crazy...am I doing something wrong? You guys might not have enough information to answer the first question but can you at least help with trying to figure out how to make the migrations work?\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\nSet up you app using the guide outlined above to use express\r\n\r\n### My Environment\r\n\r\n| Dependency          | Version  |\r\n| ---                 | ---      |\r\n| Operating System    |  MAC OS Monterrey         |\r\n| Node.js version     | v16.14.2  | <!-- run `node -v` to obtain this -->\r\n| Typescript version  | 4.5.2  | <!-- run `npm list typescript` to obtain this -->\r\n| TypeORM version     | 0.3.4  | <!-- run `npm list typeorm` to obtain this -->\r\n\r\n### Relevant Database Driver(s)\r\n\r\n<!-- Put \"yes\" instead of \"no\" to your issue's relevant databases -->\r\n\r\n| DB Type           | Reproducible  |\r\n|-------------------| ---           |\r\n| `aurora-mysql`    | no            |\r\n| `aurora-postgres` | no            |\r\n| `better-sqlite3`  | no            |\r\n| `cockroachdb`     | no            |\r\n| `cordova`         | no            |\r\n| `expo`            | no            |\r\n| `mongodb`         | no            |\r\n| `mysql`           | no            |\r\n| `nativescript`    | no            |\r\n| `oracle`          | no            |\r\n| `postgres`        | yes            |\r\n| `react-native`    | no            |\r\n| `sap`             | no            |\r\n| `sqlite`          | no            |\r\n| `sqlite-abstract` | no            |\r\n| `sqljs`           | no            |\r\n| `sqlserver`       | no            |\r\n\r\n\r\n### Are you willing to resolve this issue by submitting a Pull Request?\r\n\r\n<!-- Put \"✅\" (:white_check_mark:) to one of these options, left \"✖️\" (:heavy_multiplication_x:) others: -->\r\n\r\n - ✖️ Yes, I have the time, and I know how to start.\r\n - ✖️ Yes, I have the time, but I don't know how to start.
