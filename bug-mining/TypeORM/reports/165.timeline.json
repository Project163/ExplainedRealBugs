When these methods iterate over arrays using `for (const item of array)` and call individual drop methods, the individual methods internally remove items from the same array being iterated over. This causes the iterator to skip elements because array indices shift during iteration.\r\n\r\n**Example of the bug:**\r\nWhen dropping columns `[A, B, C, D]`:\r\n1. Iterator starts at index 0, drops column A\r\n2. Array becomes `[B, C, D]`, but iterator moves to index 1  \r\n3. Iterator now points to column C (skipping B)\r\n4. Only columns A and C are dropped, B and D remain\r\n\r\n**Solution:**\r\nChanged all affected methods to iterate over a shallow copy of the input array using the spread operator `[...array]`. This ensures that modifications to the original array don't affect the iteration.\r\n\r\n**Before (buggy):**\r\n```typescript\r\nfor (const column of columns) {\r\n    await this.dropColumn(tableOrName, column)\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n**After (fixed):**\r\n```typescript\r\nfor (const column of [...columns]) {\r\n    await this.dropColumn(tableOrName, column)\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Affected drivers and methods:**\r\n- **dropColumns**: SpannerQueryRunner, PostgresQueryRunner, MysqlQueryRunner, SqlServerQueryRunner, OracleQueryRunner, CockroachQueryRunner, SapQueryRunner, AuroraMysqlQueryRunner\r\n- **dropIndices**: SpannerQueryRunner, PostgresQueryRunner, MysqlQueryRunner, SqlServerQueryRunner, OracleQueryRunner, CockroachQueryRunner, SapQueryRunner, AuroraMysqlQueryRunner  \r\n- **dropForeignKeys**: SpannerQueryRunner, PostgresQueryRunner, CockroachQueryRunner, SapQueryRunner\r\n- **dropUniqueConstraints**: PostgresQueryRunner, SqlServerQueryRunner, OracleQueryRunner, CockroachQueryRunner\r\n\r\n**Verification:**\r\n- Added comprehensive regression test in #11563\r\n- Added unit tests demonstrating the bug pattern and fix\r\n- All tests pass and verify that all specified database objects are properly dropped\r\n- Tested across multiple database drivers (Postgres, MySQL, SQL Server, Oracle, CockroachDB, Spanner, SAP, Aurora MySQL)\r\n\r\n**Impact:**\r\nThis fix prevents potential data loss scenarios where users expect all specified database objects to be dropped but some are silently left behind due to the iteration bug.\r\n\r\n### Pull-Request Checklist\r\n\r\n-   [x] Code is up-to-date with the `master` branch\r\n-   [x] This pull request links relevant issues as `Fixes
