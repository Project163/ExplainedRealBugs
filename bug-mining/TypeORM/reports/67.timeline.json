They currently are not because of the order of the `Object.assign` call.\r\n\r\nThis reverses the order of the assign to ensure that any properties which were already defined outside of the url are properly persisted in the final configuration.\r\n\r\nThere are various reasons for this PR. What drove me to make the change was CI/CD usage. In Gitlab, you are provided a DATABASE_URL, which can have a dynamic url and port due to the kubernetes setup. My typeorm connection kept connecting to the default user's database instead of the `test` database I was providing it, because the url property was overriding the provided `database`.\r\n\r\nThis PR
