It assumes that all `simple-json` type properties should be objects, and returns `{}` in all other cases. However, that goes against the spec for `JSON.parse()` which can return an object, array, string, number, or null. Ultimately, this breaks all existing `simple-json` properties which are non-objects.\r\n\r\nA similar fix was implemented in https://github.com/typeorm/typeorm/pull/5125 and has a conversation around it. However, no tests were added to that PR, and the build is failing.
