Thank you for opening a pull request for TypeORM.\r\n\r\n  Please fill in the information below to expedite the review\r\n  and (hopefully) merge of your change.\r\n\r\n  If unsure about something.. just do as best as you're able,\r\n  or reach out through our community support channels!\r\n  https://github.com/typeorm/typeorm/blob/master/docs/support.md\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### Description of change\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n  Please be clear and concise what the change is intended to do,\r\n  why this change is needed, and how you've verified that it\r\n  corrects what you intended.\r\n\r\n  In some cases it may be helpful to include the current behavior\r\n  and the new behavior.\r\n\r\n  If the change is related to an open issue, you can link it here.\r\n  If you include `Fixes #0000` (replacing `0000` with the issue number)\r\n  when this is merged it will automatically mark the issue as fixed and\r\n  close it.\r\n-->\r\nIn current solution, when you perform update operation for MongoDB, only the first found document, that is matching the search condition, is updated. This PR is fixing this problem, making update to all documents which are supposed to be modified making update operation.\r\n\r\n### Pull-Request Checklist\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n  Please make sure to review

I have my Repository<Entity> class, there I call delete method, pass all necessary params. But when operation is done, only one entity is deleted.\r\n\r\n### Expected Behavior\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n  A clear and concise description of what you expected to happen.\r\n-->\r\nIt is expected all entities, which were matched to my search params, to be deleted\r\n\r\n### Actual Behavior\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n  A clear and concise description of what actually happened.\r\n\r\n  Please wrap any error messages or output in code tags, instead of images.\r\n-->\r\nFor now, only the first entity, matching the search params, is deleted.\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n  Your bug will be investigated much faster if we can run your code and it doesn't\r\n  have dependencies other than TypeORM. Issues without reproduction steps or\r\n  code examples may be closed as not actionable.\r\n\r\n  Please try to provide a Minimal, Complete, and Verifiable example.\r\n  http://stackoverflow.com/help/mcve\r\n-->\r\n\r\n1.
