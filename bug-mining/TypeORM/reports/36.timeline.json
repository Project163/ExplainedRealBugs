just went through this process trying to get to the underlying Sqlite connection, and I can attest that this is not very well documented in typeorm, and is confusing. \r\n\r\nThe docs only briefly mention what to do here (under the entry for driver):\r\n\r\nhttps://typeorm.io/#/connection-api/connection-api\r\n\r\nAnd even then, it's not clear if you're supposed to casting the driver to some sort of native driver class or typeorm class. Reading the source, I realized it's directing you to cast to a typeorm driver wrapper, but when you do this:\r\n\r\n```\r\nlet sqlite3Conn = getConnection().driver as SqliteDriver;\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe SqliteDriver is not exported by default, so unless you explicitly include a reference to the file in the import:\r\n\r\n```\r\nimport {SqliteDriver} from \"typeorm/driver/sqlite/SqliteDriver\";\r\n```\r\n\r\nTypescript won't even let you do it. I think getting to the underlying database connection is an important step for people, and this section in docs should be expanded.
