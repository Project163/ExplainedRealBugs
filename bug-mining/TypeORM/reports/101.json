I know the connection string works because I have used it from Python and from the Mongo shell. But it doesn't work from typeorm. I have tried both the **mongodb://** and **mongo+srv** synax. Not sure how to debug or figure this one out. Here is the error:\r\n\r\n```\r\n(node:19257) DeprecationWarning: current URL string parser is deprecated, and will be removed in a future version.
