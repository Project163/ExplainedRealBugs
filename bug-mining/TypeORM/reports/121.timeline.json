guys!\r\n\r\nJust to notice, forcing `undefined` as a possibility is not right from a strict SQL point of view.\r\nYou can actually request manual select from the query (here's an example with a COUNT):\r\n\r\n```\r\nconst queryBuilder = this\r\n      .createQueryBuilder('something')\r\n      .leftJoin('something.otherthing', 'otherthing')\r\n      ......\r\n      .select([\r\n        'COUNT(DISTINCT something.id) AS something_count',\r\n        'COUNT(DISTINCT otherthing.id) AS otherthing_count'\r\n    ])\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo, in this case, and to avoid TS errors, I must use a non-null assertion for no good reason 🤷‍♂️
