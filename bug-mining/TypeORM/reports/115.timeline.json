Unfortunatley only the `QueryFailedError` is exported from the TypeOrm-Library. This stops us from being able to check something like `error instanceOf EntityNotFoundError`. Worse, we cannot specify this error as part of the `Catch` clause from NestJS.\r\n\r\n### The Solution\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n  A clear and concise description of what you want to happen.\r\n\r\n  How can the requested feature be used to approach the problem it's supposed to solve?\r\n-->\r\nExport all errrors. \r\n\r\n\r\n### Are you willing to resolve this issue by submitting a Pull Request?\r\n\r\n- [x] Yes, I have the time, and I know how to start.\r\n- [ ] Yes, I have the time, but I don't know how to start.
