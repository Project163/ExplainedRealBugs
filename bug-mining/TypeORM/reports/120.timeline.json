If you don't, your issue may be closed.\r\n\r\n  Have a question?  This is the TypeORM issue tracker - and not the right place\r\n  for general support or questions.  Instead, check the \"Support\" Documentation\r\n  on the best places to ask questions!\r\n\r\n  https://github.com/typeorm/typeorm/blob/master/docs/support.md\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## Issue Description\r\n\r\nFor performance reasons, we have a read-replica, Read Only, of course (RO) as well as a read-write connection to our DB.  One of the columns in that DB is an hstore column.  With typeOrm 7 we got a single warning that it wasn't able to install the hstore extension (which is, of course, already there!) in the RO DB connection.  With type ORM 8 it won't even successfully complete the connection and just constantly throws warnings.\r\n\r\nThe cause can be seen here in https://github.com/typeorm/typeorm/blob/master/src/driver/postgres/PostgresDriver.ts\r\n\r\n```\r\n            try {\r\n                await this.executeQuery(connection, `CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS \"hstore\"`);\r\n            } catch (_) {\r\n                logger.log(\"warn\", \"At least one of the entities has hstore column, but the 'hstore' extension cannot be installed automatically. Please install it manually using superuser rights\");\r\n            }\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhich is *obviously* going to fail every time on a RO DB since the CREATE call fails due to the DB being RO before it gets along to see that it it exists.\r\n\r\n### Expected Behavior\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n  A clear and concise description of what you expected to happen.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nI actually *expected* a way to tell typeOrm \"this connection is read only\" and have it not attempt any write operations on that connection.  We're careful in our code to not attempt any write ops on the RO Repo but it would be nice to have the protection.  That said, at the very least there needs to be a way to say \"this is a production DB, don't try to install anything that isn't already there!\"\r\n\r\n### Actual Behavior\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n  A clear and concise description of what actually happened.\r\n\r\n  Please wrap any error messages or output in code tags, instead of images.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nLots of warnings of this type:\r\n```\r\nAt least one of the entities has hstore column, but the 'hstore' extension cannot be installed automatically. Please install it manually using superuser rights\r\n```\r\nfollowed by container death.\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n  Your bug will be investigated much faster if we can run your code and it doesn't\r\n  have dependencies other than TypeORM. Issues without reproduction steps or\r\n  code examples may be closed as not actionable.\r\n\r\n  Please try to provide a Minimal, Complete, and Verifiable example.\r\n  http://stackoverflow.com/help/mcve\r\n-->\r\n\r\n1. Create an entity with an hstore column\r\n2. Create a connection to a read-replica PG DB (or just any PG db with a user that has Read-only permissions on the DB)\r\n3. Create a repo for the given entity that uses the connection from step 2\r\n\r\n```typescript\r\n// insert code here\r\n```\r\n\r\n### My Environment\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n  Please add any other relevant dependencies to this table at the end.\r\n  For example: Electron, React Native, or NestJS.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n| Dependency          | Version  |\r\n| ---                 | ---      |\r\n| Operating System    |          |\r\n| Node.js version     | v14.15.5 | <!-- run `node -v` to obtain this -->\r\n| Typescript version  | v3.9.7 | <!-- run `npm list typescript` to obtain this -->\r\n| TypeORM version     | v0.2.20 | <!-- run `npm list typeorm` to obtain this -->\r\n| PG driver lib version | 8.3.0 |\r\n| NestJS version | 7.6.11 |\r\n| NestJS/typeOrm | 7.1.5 |\r\n\r\n\r\n### Additional Context\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n  Add any other context about the bug report here.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### Relevant Database Driver(s)\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n  Please include the relevant database drivers to your issue.\r\n\r\n  Please include an `x` inside the brackets like so:\r\n\r\n  - [ ] `cockroachdb`\r\n  - [x ] `cordova`\r\n  - [ ] `expo`\r\n-->\r\n\r\n- [ ] `aurora-data-api`\r\n- [ ] `aurora-data-api-pg`\r\n- [ ] `better-sqlite3`\r\n- [ ] `cockroachdb`\r\n- [ ] `cordova`\r\n- [ ] `expo`\r\n- [ ] `mongodb`\r\n- [ ] `mysql`\r\n- [ ] `nativescript`\r\n- [ ] `oracle`\r\n- [x] `postgres`\r\n- [ ] `react-native`\r\n- [ ] `sap`\r\n- [ ] `sqlite`\r\n- [ ] `sqlite-abstract`\r\n- [ ] `sqljs`\r\n- [ ] `sqlserver`\r\n\r\n\r\n### Are you willing to resolve this issue by submitting a Pull Request?\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n  Remember that first-time contributors are welcome! 🙌\r\n-->\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes, I have the time, and I know how to start.\r\n- [x ] Yes, I have the time, but I don't know how to start.
