This is my enum field which I didn't change after updating to 0.2.5 (it's very similar to the column setup from #2081):\r\n```ts\r\n@Column('enum', {\r\n\tenum: [EmployeeRole.OWNER, EmployeeRole.BARBER, EmployeeRole.PUBLISHER],\r\n\tarray: true\r\n})\r\n@IsDefined({each: true})\r\n@MinLength(1, {each: true})\r\nrole: EmployeeRole[];\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, when I run a query that involves this field, I'm getting the following exception:\r\n```\r\nTypeError: value.substr is not a function\r\n at PostgresDriver.prepareHydratedValue (src\\driver\\postgres\\PostgresDriver.ts:442:39)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThat line is a new addition in version 0.2.5 I noticed: [diff](https://github.com/typeorm/typeorm/compare/0.2.4...0.2.5#diff-a2a8f77fc79655011d9d2b94ebc610bdR442)\r\n\r\nThe value of `value` is `[ 'owner', 'barber' ]`, but it's treating it as a string which fails of course. So it seems like the value is already converted into an array.\r\n\r\nAm I doing something wrong or is it a bug?\r\n\r\nAdditional information:\r\nBD table:\r\n```mysql\r\nCREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS employees (\r\n\tid integer DEFAULT nextval('employees_id_seq'::regclass) NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,\r\n\tbarbershop_id uuid NOT NULL,\r\n\taccount_id uuid NOT NULL,\r\n\trole character varying[] DEFAULT '{}'::character varying[] NOT NULL,\r\n\tcreated_at timestamp without time zone NOT NULL DEFAULT now(),\r\n\tupdated_at timestamp without time zone NOT NULL DEFAULT now(),\r\n\tdeleted_at timestamp without time zone\r\n);\r\n```","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/typeorm/typeorm/issues/2142/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/typeorm/typeorm/issues/2142/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/typeorm/typeorm/issues/comments/532560854","html_url":"https://github.com/typeorm/typeorm/issues/2081#issuecomment-532560854","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/typeorm/typeorm/issues/2081","id":532560854,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUzMjU2MDg1NA==","user":{"login":"ilakshmikanthp","id":53235757,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzMjM1NzU3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/53235757?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilakshmikanthp","html_url":"https://github.com/ilakshmikanthp","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilakshmikanthp/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilakshmikanthp/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilakshmikanthp/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilakshmikanthp/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilakshmikanthp/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilakshmikanthp/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilakshmikanthp/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilakshmikanthp/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ilakshmikanthp/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-09-18T07:38:01Z","updated_at":"2019-09-18T07:38:01Z","body":"@kodayashi I want to create a reusable enum used in different entities or enum used in different columns in the same entity.
