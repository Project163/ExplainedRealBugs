See: #2059 or #1290\r\n\r\nWe could overcome those issues, if the following would be possible:\r\n\r\nPhoto.ts\r\n```ts\r\n    @ManyToOne('User', 'photos')\r\n    user: User;\r\n```\r\n\r\nUser.ts\r\n```ts\r\n    @OneToMany('Photo', 'user')\r\n    photos: Photo[];\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis should be fairly easy to implement, as it turns out that TypeORM already supports `string` instead of types (e.g. when using `EntitySchema`) - the only thing to do is to adjust the `typeFunction` type of the decorator functions.\r\n\r\n@pleerock If that feature would be ok I could post a PR :)","closed_by":{"login":"pleerock","id":1753397,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NTMzOTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1753397?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pleerock","html_url":"https://github.com/pleerock","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pleerock/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pleerock/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pleerock/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pleerock/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pleerock/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pleerock/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pleerock/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pleerock/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pleerock/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/typeorm/typeorm/issues/4190/reactions","total_count":43,"+1":14,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":8,"confused":0,"heart":21,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/typeorm/typeorm/issues/4190/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
