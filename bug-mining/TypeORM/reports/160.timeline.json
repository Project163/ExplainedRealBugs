Thank you for opening a pull request for TypeORM.\r\n\r\n  Please fill in the information below to expedite the review\r\n  and (hopefully) merge of your change.\r\n\r\n  If unsure about something.. just do as best as you're able,\r\n  or reach out through our community support channels!\r\n  https://github.com/typeorm/typeorm/blob/master/docs/support.md\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### Description of change\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n  Please be clear and concise what the change is intended to do,\r\n  why this change is needed, and how you've verified that it\r\n  corrects what you intended.\r\n\r\n  In some cases it may be helpful to include the current behavior\r\n  and the new behavior.\r\n\r\n  If the change is related to an open issue, you can link it here.\r\n  If you include `Fixes #0000` (replacing `0000` with the issue number)\r\n  when this is merged it will automatically mark the issue as fixed and\r\n  close it.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nUpdates the `test-setup.ts` to set `process.env.TZ = 'UTC'`. Tests that parse/format dates rely on the runtime timezone, and if assertions are hard coded then it can be easy for the formatted results to be off by an hour(s) or day(s). To mitigate, we set an environment variable to instruct node and other code what time zone to operate under.\r\n\r\n### Pull-Request Checklist\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n  Please make sure to review and check all
