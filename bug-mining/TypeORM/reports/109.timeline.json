This PR adds mapping for these functions to fix synchronization problems.\r\n\r\n * PostgreSQL:\r\n   * `CURRENT_TIMESTAMP` -> `now()`\r\n   * `CURRENT_TIMESTAMP(precision)` -> `('now'::text)::timestamp(precision) with time zone`\r\n   * `CURRENT_DATE` -> `('now'::text)::date`\r\n   * `CURRENT_TIME` -> `('now'::text)::time with time zone`\r\n   * `CURRENT_TIME(precision)` -> `('now'::text)::time(precision) with time zone`\r\n   * `LOCALTIME` -> `('now'::text)::time without time zone`\r\n   * `LOCALTIME(precision)` -> `('now'::text)::time(precision) without time zone`\r\n   * `LOCALTIMESTAMP` -> `('now'::text)::timestamp without time zone`\r\n   * `LOCALTIMESTAMP(precision)` -> `('now'::text)::timestamp(precision) without time zone`\r\n* SQLServer:\r\n  * `CURRENT_TIMESTAMP` -> `getdate()`\r\n* CockroachDB\r\n  * `CURRENT_TIMESTAMP` -> `current_timestamp()`\r\n  * `CURRENT_DATE` -> `current_date()`\r\n* MySQL:\r\n  *   `CURRENT_TIMESTAMP()` -> `CURRENT_TIMESTAMP`\r\n* MariaDB:\r\n  *   `CURRENT_TIMESTAMP` -> `CURRENT_TIMESTAMP()`\r\n\r\n#### fixed issues:\r\n\r\nFixes #2136\r\nFixes #2718\r\nFixes #2737\r\nFixes #3561\r\nFixes
