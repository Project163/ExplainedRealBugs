From looking at the source code this seems to be currently possible only for **MySQL** and not for **PostgreSQL**:\r\n```ts\r\n@Entity()\r\nexport class User {\r\n  ...\r\n  @Column({comment: 'The age in years.'})  // <--\r\n  age: number\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nUsing PostgreSQL one can also set a COMMENT on the **table** itself, which is not yet supported by TypeORM at all, but could look like this:\r\n```ts\r\n@Entity({comment: 'A user profile in the wep app.'})  // <--\r\nexport class User {\r\n  ...\r\n  @Column({comment: 'The age in years.'})\r\n  age: number\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nI am asking for this feature as I am using the awesome PostGraphile tool, which heavily relies on COMMENTs for its configuration, and it would be really useful to do this by using TypeORM entity decorators!!\r\n\r\nMany thanks,\r\nUlrich","closed_by":{"login":"imnotjames","id":1551593,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1NTE1OTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1551593?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/imnotjames","html_url":"https://github.com/imnotjames","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imnotjames/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imnotjames/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imnotjames/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imnotjames/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imnotjames/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imnotjames/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imnotjames/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imnotjames/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imnotjames/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/typeorm/typeorm/issues/3360/reactions","total_count":39,"+1":33,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":6,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/typeorm/typeorm/issues/3360/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
