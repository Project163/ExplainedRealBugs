Thank you for opening a pull request for TypeORM.\r\n\r\n  Please fill in the information below to expedite the review\r\n  and (hopefully) merge of your change.\r\n\r\n  If unsure about something.. just do as best as you're able,\r\n  or reach out through our community support channels!\r\n  https://github.com/typeorm/typeorm/blob/master/docs/support.md\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### Description of change\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n  Please be clear and concise what the change is intended to do,\r\n  why this change is needed, and how you've verified that it\r\n  corrects what you intended.\r\n\r\n  In some cases it may be helpful to include the current behavior\r\n  and the new behavior.\r\n\r\n  If the change is related to an open issue, you can link it here.\r\n  If you include `Fixes #0000` (replacing `0000` with the issue number)\r\n  when this is merged it will automatically mark the issue as fixed and\r\n  close it.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nBecause Promise.all() returns after the first error, some connection may still connect even though the tests already continue to the next unit. This results in a dangling connection which may prevent other tests to continue. Because this is a race condition it happened only sometimes.\r\n\r\n### Pull-Request Checklist\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n  Please make sure to review and check all of the following.\r\n\r\n  If an item is not
