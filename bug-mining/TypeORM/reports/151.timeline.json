feel like this should be a relatively easy fix in general, however there's one concern I have:\r\n\r\nIf we keep `\"each\" | \"all\" | \"none\"`, and proceed as suggested with the default being `false` in `\"none\"` and `true` in `\"each\"` and a failure in `\"all\"`, that causes a state where the defaults do fundamentally opposite things based on the overall transaction setting.\r\nIf you set no explicit value in the migration, it really should still behave the same no matter what.\r\n\r\nAnother more general issue is the existence of `\"all\"` in the first place.  \r\nOnce a single transaction overrides its setting to `false`, `\"all\"` is forever broken.  \r\nThat makes it sort of a poor default as well given that a single default override on a migration breaks the overall default.\r\n\r\nAny large production system eventually needs to run a migration outside of a transaction, so once you hit that point, you need to switch the default from what it has been all the time until then to `each` or `none` which leaves you with uncertainty about the impact of such change.\r\n\r\nAs such, in my opinion, `\"all\"` should never be a default and should be discouraged so that all solutions are engineered with that in mind from the start.\r\n\r\nSo for me the issue here is less of a \"can we build this\" and more of a \"how can we build this in a way to not create even more confusing possibilities\".\r\n\r\nWe could enable it only in `\"each\"` mode, but then you would expect a default of `true` for all cases where `transaction` is `undefined` which is also somewhat confusing.\r\n\r\nWe could also create a new mode `\"custom\"` and enforce that every single override is set.\r\nThat would probably be the most clear version, but creates one more option in the confusing constellation we already have.\r\nIt would also make it so that autogenerated migrations by default do not work in `\"custom\"` mode.\r\n\r\nDoes anyone have a good plan for this? We also really need the ability to skip transactions, but I don't just want to add even more tech debt to this part of the

Description of change\r\n\r\nCloses #7087\r\n\r\nImplements the ability to override the transaction behavior per migration.\r\nThis allows for example to run every migration in a separate transaction by default,\r\nbut to run specific migrations like using `CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY` outside of a transaction.\r\n\r\nTrying to set per-migration overrides in the `\"all\"` transaction mode will cause an error to prevent accidental confusing behavior.\r\n\r\nWhen the transaction mode is `\"each\"` the default is to run in a transaction.\r\nWhen the transaction mode is `\"none\"` the default is to not run in a transaction.\r\n\r\n### Pull-Request Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] Code is up-to-date with the `master` branch\r\n- [x] `npm run format` to apply prettier formatting\r\n- [x] `npm run test`

Highlights</h2>\n<p>This patch addresses a number of bugs listed below.<br>\nMost notably, for client side encryption users upgrading to this version of the driver along with the new version of <a href=\"https://www.npmjs.com/package/mongodb-client-encryption\" rel=\"nofollow\">mongodb-client-encryption@1.2.3</a> will alleviate the potential deadlock case if your connection pool was fully utilized. There will now be an internal MongoClient that will be used for metadata look ups (e.g, <code>listCollections</code>) when the pool size is under certain constraints. The events generated from this client are forwarded to the client instance you initialize so it is possible to monitor all events.</p>\n<h2>Bug</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>[<a href=\"https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/NODE-2995\" rel=\"nofollow\">NODE-2995</a>] - Sharing a MongoClient for metadata lookup can lead to deadlock in drivers using automatic encryption</li>\n<li>[<a href=\"https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/NODE-3050\" rel=\"nofollow\">NODE-3050</a>] - Infinite loop on Windows due to a bug in require_optional package</li>\n<li>[<a href=\"https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/NODE-3120\" rel=\"nofollow\">NODE-3120</a>] - TypeError: Cannot read property 'roundTripTime' of undefined</li>\n<li>[<a href=\"https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/NODE-3122\" rel=\"nofollow\">NODE-3122</a>] - Pipelining an upload stream of GridFSBucket never finishes on Node v14</li>\n<li>[<a href=\"https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/NODE-3129\" rel=\"nofollow\">NODE-3129</a>] - Collection () .. .setReadPreference() not routing query to secondaries</li>\n<li>[<a href=\"https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/NODE-3133\" rel=\"nofollow\">NODE-3133</a>] - autoEncryption produces serverHeartbeatFailed - with MongoError typemismatch</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Improvement</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>[<a href=\"https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/NODE-3070\" rel=\"nofollow\">NODE-3070</a>] - Define error handling behavior of writeErrors and writeConcernError on Mongos</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Documentation</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Reference: <a href=\"http://mongodb.github.io/node-mongodb-native/3.6\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://mongodb.github.io/node-mongodb-native/3.6</a></li>\n<li>API: <a href=\"http://mongodb.github.io/node-mongodb-native/3.6/api\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://mongodb.github.io/node-mongodb-native/3.6/api</a></li>\n<li>Changelog: <a href=\"https://github.com/mongodb/node-mongodb-native/blob/3.6/HISTORY.md\">https://github.com/mongodb/node-mongodb-native/blob/3.6/HISTORY.md</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>We invite you to try the driver immediately, and report any issues to the NODE project.</p>\n<p>Thanks very much to all the community members who contributed to this release!</p>\n      </li>\n      <li>\n        <b>3.6.5</b> - <a href=\"https://github.com/mongodb/node-mongodb-native/releases/tag/v3.6.5\">2021-03-16</a></br><p>The MongoDB Node.js team is pleased to announce version 3.6.5 of the driver!</p>\n<h2>Notable Fixes</h2>\n<p>In this patch there is a fix surrounding an issue some users were encountering in serverless environments when using the Unified Topology. If the nodejs process went unused for a great amount of time there was an intermittent issue that would cause <code>startSession</code> to fail, however, issuing a dummy read request would resolve the problem. The session support check is now done after server selection meaning the driver has the most up to date information about the MongoDB deployment before utilizing sessions. We encourage any user's that implemented workarounds to updated their driver and make use of this fix.</p>\n<p>In addition, the previous release of our driver added a warning about an upcoming change in the v4 version of the driver about how users can specify their write concern options. We've updated the driver to use nodejs's <code>process.emitWarning</code> API in nearly all cases where the driver prints something out, as well as limit most warning messages to only be printed once.</p>\n<h2>Bug</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>session support detection spec compliance (<a href=\"https://github.com/mongodb/node-mongodb-native/issues/2732\" data-hovercard-type=\"pull_request\" data-hovercard-url=\"/mongodb/node-mongodb-native/pull/2732/hovercard\">#2732</a>) (<a href=\"https://github.com/mongodb/node-mongodb-native/commit/9baec7128f612f2d9c290c85d24e33602f911499\">9baec71</a>)</li>\n<li>[<a href=\"https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/NODE-3100\" rel=\"nofollow\">NODE-3100</a>] - startSession fails intermittently on servers that support sessions</li>\n<li>[<a href=\"https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/NODE-3066\" rel=\"nofollow\">NODE-3066</a>] - Accessing non-existent property 'MongoError' of module exports inside circular dependency</li>\n<li>[<a href=\"https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/NODE-3114\" rel=\"nofollow\">NODE-3114</a>] - Incorrect warning: Top-level use of w, wtimeout, j, and fsync is deprecated</li>\n<li>[<a href=\"https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/NODE-3119\" rel=\"nofollow\">NODE-3119</a>] - Node 14.5.4, mongo 3.6.4 Circular warnings</li>\n</ul>\n      </li>\n      <li>\n        <b>3.6.4</b> - <a href=\"https://github.com/mongodb/node-mongodb-native/releases/tag/v3.6.4\">2021-02-02</a></br><h1>MongoDB Driver v3.6.4</h1>\n<p>The MongoDB Node.js team is pleased to announce version 3.6.4 of the driver</p>\n<h2>Release Highlights</h2>\n<h3>Explain Support</h3>\n<p>The full set of $explain verbosity settings are now supported:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>queryPlanner</code></li>\n<li><code>queryPlannerExtended</code></li>\n<li><code>executionStats</code></li>\n<li><code>allPlansExecution</code></li>\n</ul>\n<p>In the following commands:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>aggregate()</code> (MDB 3.0+)</li>\n<li><code>find()</code> (MDB 3.0+)</li>\n<li><code>remove()</code> (MDB 3.0+)</li>\n<li><code>update()</code> (MDB 3.0+)</li>\n<li><code>distinct()</code> (MDB 3.2+)</li>\n<li><code>findAndModify()</code> (MDB 3.2+)</li>\n<li><code>mapReduce()</code> (MDB 4.4+)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You can get a lot of insight into the performance of a query or optimization using these fine grained reports.<br>\nTo learn more about how to use explain <a href=\"https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/method/cursor.explain/\" rel=\"nofollow\">read here</a>.</p>\n<h3>Direct Connection Issue Revert</h3>\n<p>We removed automatic direct connection for the unified topology in the 3.6.3 release of the driver. This change was preparatory for the 4.0 version of the driver, where we'll always perform automatic discovery. To avoid making this kind of change in a patch release, this version restores automatic direct connection when connecting to a single host using the unified topology without a specified replicaSet and without directConnection: false, in line with previous 3.6 releases.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> In the next major version the <code>unifiedTopology</code> is the only Topology and it is required to either specify a <code>replicaSet</code> name or enable <code>directConnection</code> in order to connect to single nodes in a replica set.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>Support Azure and GCP keystores in FLE</h3>\n<p>There are no functional changes to the driver to support using Azure and GCP keystores but a new mongodb-client-encryption release (v1.2.0) can be found <a href=\"https://github.com/mongodb/libmongocrypt/releases/tag/node-v1.2.0\">here</a> which prominently features support for these key stores.</p>\n<h2>Documentation</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Reference: <a href=\"http://mongodb.github.io/node-mongodb-native/3.6\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://mongodb.github.io/node-mongodb-native/3.6</a></li>\n<li>API: <a href=\"http://mongodb.github.io/node-mongodb-native/3.6/api\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://mongodb.github.io/node-mongodb-native/3.6/api</a></li>\n<li>Changelog: <a href=\"https://github.com/mongodb/node-mongodb-native/blob/3.6/HISTORY.md\">https://github.com/mongodb/node-mongodb-native/blob/3.6/HISTORY.md</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>We invite you to try the driver immediately, and report any issues to the NODE project.</p>\n<p>Thanks very much to all the community members who contributed to this release!</p>\n<h2>Release Notes</h2>\n<h3>Bug</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>[<a href=\"https://jira.mongodb.com/browse/NODE-2355\" rel=\"nofollow\">NODE-2355</a>] -

<a href=\"https://github.com/mongodb/node-mongodb-native/releases/tag/v3.6.3\">2020-11-06</a></br><p>The MongoDB Node.js team is pleased to announce version 3.6.3 of the driver</p>\n<h2>Release Highlights</h2>\n<h3><a href=\"https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/NODE-2784\" rel=\"nofollow\"><code>MongoError: not master</code> when running <code>createIndex</code></a></h3>\n<p>A regression introduced in v3.6.2 meant that <code>createIndex</code> operations would not be executed with a fixed<br>\nprimary read preference. This resulted in the driver selecting any server for the operation, which would<br>\nfail if a non-primary was selected.</p>\n<h3><a href=\"https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/NODE-2829\" rel=\"nofollow\">Performance issues on AWS Lambda</a></h3>\n<p>The driver periodically monitors members of the replicaset for changes in the topology, but ensures that<br>\nthe \"monitoring thread\" is never woken sooner than 500ms. Measuring this elapsed time depends on a<br>\nstable clock, which is not available to us in some virtualized environments like AWS Lambda. The result<br>\nwas that periodically operations would think there were no available servers, and the driver would force<br>\na wait of <code>heartbeatFrequencyMS</code> (10s by default) before reaching out to servers again for a new<br>\nmonitoring check. The internal async interval timer has been improved to account for these environments</p>\n<h3><a href=\"https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/NODE-2859\" rel=\"nofollow\">GSSAPI AuthProvider reuses single kerberos client</a></h3>\n<p>A regression introduced in v3.6.0 forced the driver to reuse a single kerberos client for all<br>\nauthentication attempts. This would result in incomplete authentication flows, and occaisionally even<br>\na crash in the <code>kerberos</code> module. The driver has been reverted to creating a kerberos client per<br>\nauthentication attempt.</p>\n<h3><a href=\"https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/NODE-2861\" rel=\"nofollow\">Performance regression due to use of <code>setImmediate</code></a></h3>\n<p>A change introduced in v3.6.1 switched all our usage of <code>process.nextTick</code> in the connection pool with<br>\n<code>setImmediate</code> per <a href=\"https://nodejs.org/en/docs/guides/event-loop-timers-and-nexttick/#process-nexttick-vs-setimmediate\" rel=\"nofollow\">Node.js core recommendation</a>. This was observed to introduce noticeable latency when the event loop<br>\nwas experiencing pressure, so the change was reverted for this release pending further investigation.</p>\n<h3>Community Contributions</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a class=\"user-mention notranslate\" data-hovercard-type=\"user\" data-hovercard-url=\"/users/jswangjunsheng/hovercard\" data-octo-click=\"hovercard-link-click\" data-octo-dimensions=\"link_type:self\" href=\"https://github.com/jswangjunsheng\">@ jswangjunsheng</a> submitted a fix for a rare scenario when wait queue members time out before connection establishment</li>\n<li><a class=\"user-mention notranslate\" data-hovercard-type=\"user\" data-hovercard-url=\"/users/through-a-haze/hovercard\" data-octo-click=\"hovercard-link-click\" data-octo-dimensions=\"link_type:self\" href=\"https://github.com/through-a-haze\">@ through-a-haze</a> submitted a fix for incorrect construction of an X509 authentication message</li>\n<li><a class=\"user-mention notranslate\" data-hovercard-type=\"user\" data-hovercard-url=\"/users/andreialecu/hovercard\" data-octo-click=\"hovercard-link-click\" data-octo-dimensions=\"link_type:self\" href=\"https://github.com/andreialecu\">@ andreialecu</a> helped us indicate peer optional dependencies in our <code>package.json</code> for stricter package managers (pnpm, yarn2)</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Documentation</h2>\n<p>Reference: <a href=\"http://mongodb.github.io/node-mongodb-native/3.6/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://mongodb.github.io/node-mongodb-native/3.6/</a><br>\nAPI: <a href=\"http://mongodb.github.io/node-mongodb-native/3.6/api/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://mongodb.github.io/node-mongodb-native/3.6/api/</a><br>\nChangelog: <a href=\"https://github.com/mongodb/node-mongodb-native/blob/3.6/HISTORY.md\">https://github.com/mongodb/node-mongodb-native/blob/3.6/HISTORY.md</a></p>\n<p>We invite you to try the driver immediately, and report any issues to the NODE project.</p>\n<p>Thanks very much to all the community members who contributed to this release!</p>\n<h2>Release Notes</h2>\n<h2>        Bug\n</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>[<a href=\"https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/NODE-2172\" rel=\"nofollow\">NODE-2172</a>] -

Highlights</h2>\n<p>This patch addresses a number of bugs listed below.<br>\nMost notably, for client side encryption users upgrading to this version of the driver along with the new version of <a href=\"https://www.npmjs.com/package/mongodb-client-encryption\" rel=\"nofollow\">mongodb-client-encryption@1.2.3</a> will alleviate the potential deadlock case if your connection pool was fully utilized. There will now be an internal MongoClient that will be used for metadata look ups (e.g, <code>listCollections</code>) when the pool size is under certain constraints. The events generated from this client are forwarded to the client instance you initialize so it is possible to monitor all events.</p>\n<h2>Bug</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>[<a href=\"https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/NODE-2995\" rel=\"nofollow\">NODE-2995</a>] - Sharing a MongoClient for metadata lookup can lead to deadlock in drivers using automatic encryption</li>\n<li>[<a href=\"https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/NODE-3050\" rel=\"nofollow\">NODE-3050</a>] - Infinite loop on Windows due to a bug in require_optional package</li>\n<li>[<a href=\"https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/NODE-3120\" rel=\"nofollow\">NODE-3120</a>] - TypeError: Cannot read property 'roundTripTime' of undefined</li>\n<li>[<a href=\"https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/NODE-3122\" rel=\"nofollow\">NODE-3122</a>] - Pipelining an upload stream of GridFSBucket never finishes on Node v14</li>\n<li>[<a href=\"https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/NODE-3129\" rel=\"nofollow\">NODE-3129</a>] - Collection () .. .setReadPreference() not routing query to secondaries</li>\n<li>[<a href=\"https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/NODE-3133\" rel=\"nofollow\">NODE-3133</a>] - autoEncryption produces serverHeartbeatFailed - with MongoError typemismatch</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Improvement</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>[<a href=\"https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/NODE-3070\" rel=\"nofollow\">NODE-3070</a>] - Define error handling behavior of writeErrors and writeConcernError on Mongos</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Documentation</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Reference: <a href=\"http://mongodb.github.io/node-mongodb-native/3.6\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://mongodb.github.io/node-mongodb-native/3.6</a></li>\n<li>API: <a href=\"http://mongodb.github.io/node-mongodb-native/3.6/api\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://mongodb.github.io/node-mongodb-native/3.6/api</a></li>\n<li>Changelog: <a href=\"https://github.com/mongodb/node-mongodb-native/blob/3.6/HISTORY.md\">https://github.com/mongodb/node-mongodb-native/blob/3.6/HISTORY.md</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>We invite you to try the driver immediately, and report any issues to the NODE project.</p>\n<p>Thanks very much to all the community members who contributed to this release!</p>\n      </li>\n      <li>\n        <b>3.6.5</b> - <a href=\"https://github.com/mongodb/node-mongodb-native/releases/tag/v3.6.5\">2021-03-16</a></br><p>The MongoDB Node.js team is pleased to announce version 3.6.5 of the driver!</p>\n<h2>Notable Fixes</h2>\n<p>In this patch there is a fix surrounding an issue some users were encountering in serverless environments when using the Unified Topology. If the nodejs process went unused for a great amount of time there was an intermittent issue that would cause <code>startSession</code> to fail, however, issuing a dummy read request would resolve the problem. The session support check is now done after server selection meaning the driver has the most up to date information about the MongoDB deployment before utilizing sessions. We encourage any user's that implemented workarounds to updated their driver and make use of this fix.</p>\n<p>In addition, the previous release of our driver added a warning about an upcoming change in the v4 version of the driver about how users can specify their write concern options. We've updated the driver to use nodejs's <code>process.emitWarning</code> API in nearly all cases where the driver prints something out, as well as limit most warning messages to only be printed once.</p>\n<h2>Bug</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>session support detection spec compliance (<a href=\"https://github.com/mongodb/node-mongodb-native/issues/2732\" data-hovercard-type=\"pull_request\" data-hovercard-url=\"/mongodb/node-mongodb-native/pull/2732/hovercard\">#2732</a>) (<a href=\"https://github.com/mongodb/node-mongodb-native/commit/9baec7128f612f2d9c290c85d24e33602f911499\">9baec71</a>)</li>\n<li>[<a href=\"https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/NODE-3100\" rel=\"nofollow\">NODE-3100</a>] - startSession fails intermittently on servers that support sessions</li>\n<li>[<a href=\"https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/NODE-3066\" rel=\"nofollow\">NODE-3066</a>] - Accessing non-existent property 'MongoError' of module exports inside circular dependency</li>\n<li>[<a href=\"https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/NODE-3114\" rel=\"nofollow\">NODE-3114</a>] - Incorrect warning: Top-level use of w, wtimeout, j, and fsync is deprecated</li>\n<li>[<a href=\"https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/NODE-3119\" rel=\"nofollow\">NODE-3119</a>] - Node 14.5.4, mongo 3.6.4 Circular warnings</li>\n</ul>\n      </li>\n      <li>\n        <b>3.6.4</b> - <a href=\"https://github.com/mongodb/node-mongodb-native/releases/tag/v3.6.4\">2021-02-02</a></br><h1>MongoDB Driver v3.6.4</h1>\n<p>The MongoDB Node.js team is pleased to announce version 3.6.4 of the driver</p>\n<h2>Release Highlights</h2>\n<h3>Explain Support</h3>\n<p>The full set of $explain verbosity settings are now supported:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>queryPlanner</code></li>\n<li><code>queryPlannerExtended</code></li>\n<li><code>executionStats</code></li>\n<li><code>allPlansExecution</code></li>\n</ul>\n<p>In the following commands:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>aggregate()</code> (MDB 3.0+)</li>\n<li><code>find()</code> (MDB 3.0+)</li>\n<li><code>remove()</code> (MDB 3.0+)</li>\n<li><code>update()</code> (MDB 3.0+)</li>\n<li><code>distinct()</code> (MDB 3.2+)</li>\n<li><code>findAndModify()</code> (MDB 3.2+)</li>\n<li><code>mapReduce()</code> (MDB 4.4+)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You can get a lot of insight into the performance of a query or optimization using these fine grained reports.<br>\nTo learn more about how to use explain <a href=\"https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/method/cursor.explain/\" rel=\"nofollow\">read here</a>.</p>\n<h3>Direct Connection Issue Revert</h3>\n<p>We removed automatic direct connection for the unified topology in the 3.6.3 release of the driver. This change was preparatory for the 4.0 version of the driver, where we'll always perform automatic discovery.

<a href=\"https://github.com/mongodb/node-mongodb-native/releases/tag/v3.6.3\">2020-11-06</a></br><p>The MongoDB Node.js team is pleased to announce version 3.6.3 of the driver</p>\n<h2>Release Highlights</h2>\n<h3><a href=\"https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/NODE-2784\" rel=\"nofollow\"><code>MongoError: not master</code> when running <code>createIndex</code></a></h3>\n<p>A regression introduced in v3.6.2 meant that <code>createIndex</code> operations would not be executed with a fixed<br>\nprimary read preference. This resulted in the driver selecting any server for the operation, which would<br>\nfail if a non-primary was selected.</p>\n<h3><a href=\"https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/NODE-2829\" rel=\"nofollow\">Performance issues on AWS Lambda</a></h3>\n<p>The driver periodically monitors members of the replicaset for changes in the topology, but ensures that<br>\nthe \"monitoring thread\" is never woken sooner than 500ms. Measuring this elapsed time depends on a<br>\nstable clock, which is not available to us in some virtualized environments like AWS Lambda. The result<br>\nwas that periodically operations would think there were no available servers, and the driver would force<br>\na wait of <code>heartbeatFrequencyMS</code> (10s by default) before reaching out to servers again for a new<br>\nmonitoring check. The internal async interval timer has been improved to account for these environments</p>\n<h3><a href=\"https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/NODE-2859\" rel=\"nofollow\">GSSAPI AuthProvider reuses single kerberos client</a></h3>\n<p>A regression introduced in v3.6.0 forced the driver to reuse a single kerberos client for all<br>\nauthentication attempts. This would result in incomplete authentication flows, and occaisionally even<br>\na crash in the <code>kerberos</code> module. The driver has been reverted to creating a kerberos client per<br>\nauthentication attempt.</p>\n<h3><a href=\"https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/NODE-2861\" rel=\"nofollow\">Performance regression due to use of <code>setImmediate</code></a></h3>\n<p>A change introduced in v3.6.1 switched all our usage of <code>process.nextTick</code> in the connection pool with<br>\n<code>setImmediate</code> per <a href=\"https://nodejs.org/en/docs/guides/event-loop-timers-and-nexttick/#process-nexttick-vs-setimmediate\" rel=\"nofollow\">Node.js core recommendation</a>. This was observed to introduce noticeable latency when the event loop<br>\nwas experiencing pressure, so the change was reverted for this release pending further investigation.</p>\n<h3>Community Contributions</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a class=\"user-mention notranslate\" data-hovercard-type=\"user\" data-hovercard-url=\"/users/jswangjunsheng/hovercard\" data-octo-click=\"hovercard-link-click\" data-octo-dimensions=\"link_type:self\" href=\"https://github.com/jswangjunsheng\">@ jswangjunsheng</a> submitted a fix for a rare scenario when wait queue members time out before connection establishment</li>\n<li><a class=\"user-mention notranslate\" data-hovercard-type=\"user\" data-hovercard-url=\"/users/through-a-haze/hovercard\" data-octo-click=\"hovercard-link-click\" data-octo-dimensions=\"link_type:self\" href=\"https://github.com/through-a-haze\">@ through-a-haze</a> submitted a fix for incorrect construction of an X509 authentication message</li>\n<li><a class=\"user-mention notranslate\" data-hovercard-type=\"user\" data-hovercard-url=\"/users/andreialecu/hovercard\" data-octo-click=\"hovercard-link-click\" data-octo-dimensions=\"link_type:self\" href=\"https://github.com/andreialecu\">@ andreialecu</a> helped us indicate peer optional dependencies in our <code>package.json</code> for stricter package managers (pnpm, yarn2)</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Documentation</h2>\n<p>Reference: <a href=\"http://mongodb.github.io/node-mongodb-native/3.6/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://mongodb.github.io/node-mongodb-native/3.6/</a><br>\nAPI: <a href=\"http://mongodb.github.io/node-mongodb-native/3.6/api/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://mongodb.github.io/node-mongodb-native/3.6/api/</a><br>\nChangelog: <a href=\"https://github.com/mongodb/node-mongodb-native/blob/3.6/HISTORY.md\">https://github.com/mongodb/node-mongodb-native/blob/3.6/HISTORY.md</a></p>\n<p>We invite you to try the driver immediately, and report any issues to the NODE project.</p>\n<p>Thanks very much to all the community members who contributed to this release!</p>\n<h2>Release Notes</h2>\n<h2>        Bug\n</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>[<a href=\"https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/NODE-2172\" rel=\"nofollow\">NODE-2172</a>] -

This is necessary, for example, if trying to drop an index concurrently in the revert.\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nThe revert still runs in a transaction.\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\nI have created a repo which can easily reproduce the issue [here](https://github.com/ewise-pager/typeorm-migration-bug).\r\nSteps:\r\n1. Bring up the DB with `docker compose up db -d`.\r\n2. Run `npm install`.\r\n3. Run the migrations with `npx ts-node ./node_modules/.bin/typeorm migration:run -d ./data-source.ts`.\r\n4. Try to revert the migrations with `npx ts-node ./node_modules/.bin/typeorm migration:revert -d ./data-source.ts`.\r\n\r\nYou will see the error `QueryFailedError: DROP INDEX CONCURRENTLY cannot run inside a transaction block`.\n\n### My Environment\n\n| Dependency          | Version  |\r\n| Operating System    | Ubuntu 22.04.4 LTS |\r\n| Node.js version     | v20.17.0 |\r\n| Typescript version  | v5.6.2 |\r\n| TypeORM version   | v0.3.20 |\r\n\n\n### Additional Context\n\nThis issue is also mentioned in this comment: https://github.com/typeorm/typeorm/issues/7087#issuecomment-1921394971\r\n\r\nAlso, I did set `migrationsTransactionMode: 'each'` in the `data-source.ts` file.\n\n### Relevant Database Driver(s)\n\n- [ ] aurora-mysql\n- [ ] aurora-postgres\n- [ ] better-sqlite3\n- [ ] cockroachdb\n- [ ] cordova\n- [ ] expo\n- [ ] mongodb\n- [ ] mysql\n- [ ] nativescript\n- [ ] oracle\n- [X] postgres\n- [ ] react-native\n- [ ] sap\n- [ ] spanner\n- [ ] sqlite\n- [ ] sqlite-abstract\n- [ ] sqljs\n- [ ] sqlserver\n\n### Are you willing to resolve this issue by submitting a Pull Request?\n\nYes, I have the time, but I don't know how to start.
