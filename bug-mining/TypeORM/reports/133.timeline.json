 -- just stumbled on this thread after scraping against version 3 breaking changes. We do the same as you with .env files and a ConfigService wrapper for dotenv. I don't have a solution for the full path when generating migrations, but we are able to generate a datasource that re-uses the typeorm options that the app uses. I added a file with the following in it:\r\n\r\n**src/libs/typeorm/datasource.ts** \r\n```ts\r\n// ... (construct configService and logger first...)\r\nconst datasource = new DataSource(getDataSourceOptions(configService, logger, '/services/'));\r\n\r\n/**\r\n * This is for typeorm CLI so it can be passed -d [.../datasource.js] (see package.json)\r\n */\r\nexport default datasource;\r\n```\r\n\r\n...then the options are handled like this...\r\n\r\n**src/libs/typeorm/typeorm-options.ts** \r\n```ts\r\nexport function getDataSourceOptions(\r\n  configService: ConfigService,\r\n  logger: LoggerService,\r\n  entitiesPath: string\r\n): DataSourceOptions {\r\n  return {\r\n    type: configService.getString('TYPEORM_CONNECTION') as 'postgres',\r\n    host: configService.getString('TYPEORM_HOST'),\r\n    port: configService.getNumber('TYPEORM_PORT'),\r\n    database: configService.getString('TYPEORM_DATABASE'),\r\n    username: configService.getString('TYPEORM_USERNAME'),\r\n    password: configService.getString('TYPEORM_PASSWORD'),\r\n    entities: [__dirname + '/../..' + entitiesPath + configService.getString('TYPEORM_ENTITIES_APP')],\r\n    synchronize: configService.getBoolean('TYPEORM_SYNCHRONIZE'),\r\n    logger: new TypeOrmLogger(configService, logger),\r\n    extra: {\r\n      max: configService.getNumber('TYPEORM_POOL_SIZE_MAX')\r\n    },\r\n    connectTimeoutMS: configService.getNumber('TYPEORM_CONNECT_TIMEOUT_MS'),\r\n    logNotifications: configService.getBoolean('TYPEORM_LOG_NOTIFICATIONS'),\r\n    migrations: [__dirname + '/../../../' + configService.getString('TYPEORM_MIGRATIONS')],\r\n    poolErrorHandler\r\n  };\r\n}\r\n\r\n// following function is for NestJS bootstrapping...\r\nexport function getTypeOrmModuleOptionsFactory(\r\n  configService: ConfigService,\r\n  logger: LoggerService,\r\n  entitiesPath: string\r\n): (...args: any[]) => Promise<TypeOrmModuleOptions> {\r\n  return async () => getDataSourceOptions(configService, logger, entitiesPath);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\npackage.json\r\n```json\r\n    \"typeorm:gen\": \"run-s build:clean build:dist build:pkg \\\"typeorm migration:run\\\" \\\"typeorm migration:generate -- {1} {2}\\\" --\",\r\n    \"typeorm:migrate\": \"run-s \\\"typeorm migration:run\\\"\",\r\n    \"typeorm:revert\": \"run-s \\\"typeorm migration:revert\\\"\",\r\n    \"typeorm\": \"ts-node -r tsconfig-paths/register ./node_modules/typeorm/cli.js -d dist/libs/typeorm/datasource.js\",\r\n```\r\n \r\nThe CLI commands in package.json get passed the datasource, and the NestJS app(s) uses the factory function. All the actual config values are handled in .env files and our ConfigService wrapper.\r\n\r\n","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/typeorm/typeorm/issues/comments/1188376449/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"mlandisbqs","id":39845713,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5ODQ1NzEz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/39845713?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mlandisbqs","html_url":"https://github.com/mlandisbqs","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mlandisbqs/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mlandisbqs/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mlandisbqs/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mlandisbqs/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mlandisbqs/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mlandisbqs/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mlandisbqs/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mlandisbqs/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mlandisbqs/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":7016030763,"node_id":"MEE_lADOAyVBJc5F8-3bzwAAAAGiMCIr","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/typeorm/typeorm/issues/events/7016030763","actor":{"login":"jkalberer","id":90280207,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkwMjgwMjA3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/90280207?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkalberer","html_url":"https://github.com/jkalberer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkalberer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkalberer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkalberer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkalberer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkalberer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkalberer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkalberer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkalberer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkalberer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-07-18T22:15:13Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":7016030765,"node_id":"SE_lADOAyVBJc5F8-3bzwAAAAGiMCIt","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/typeorm/typeorm/issues/events/7016030765","actor":{"login":"jkalberer","id":90280207,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkwMjgwMjA3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/90280207?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkalberer","html_url":"https://github.com/jkalberer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkalberer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkalberer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkalberer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkalberer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkalberer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkalberer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkalberer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkalberer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkalberer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-07-18T22:15:13Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/typeorm/typeorm/issues/comments/1198157587","html_url":"https://github.com/typeorm/typeorm/issues/8762#issuecomment-1198157587","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/typeorm/typeorm/issues/8762","id":1198157587,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAyVBJc5Ham8T","user":{"login":"DanielMenke","id":8995003,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg5OTUwMDM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8995003?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/DanielMenke","html_url":"https://github.com/DanielMenke","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DanielMenke/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DanielMenke/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DanielMenke/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DanielMenke/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DanielMenke/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DanielMenke/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DanielMenke/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DanielMenke/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DanielMenke/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-07-28T13:39:59Z","updat
