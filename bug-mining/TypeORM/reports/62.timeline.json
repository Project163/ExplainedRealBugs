postgres.\r\n\r\nMinimal entity declaration:\r\n```ts\r\nimport { Entity, Column, PrimaryGeneratedColumn } from \"typeorm\";\r\n\r\n@Entity()\r\nexport class Foo {\r\n  @PrimaryGeneratedColumn()\r\n  id: number;\r\n\r\n  @Column()\r\n  requiredString: string;\r\n\r\n  @Column({ type: \"text\", nullable: true })\r\n  optionalString: string | null;\r\n\r\n  @Column({ type: \"text\", nullable: true, default: null })\r\n  optionalStringWithExplicitDefault: string | null;\r\n}\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nEven after syncing the schema, generating a migration still results in the lines\r\n\r\n```ts\r\n// from `up` method\r\nawait queryRunner.query(`ALTER TABLE \"foo\" ALTER COLUMN \"optionalstringwithexplicitdefault\" SET DEFAULT null`);\r\n\r\n// in `down` method\r\nawait queryRunner.query(`ALTER TABLE \"foo\" ALTER COLUMN \"optionalstringwithexplicitdefault\" DROP DEFAULT`);\r\n```\r\n\r\nExpected behavior: the migration should not include these lines.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/typeorm/typeorm/issues/6950/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/typeorm/typeorm/issues/6950/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/typeorm/typeorm/issues/comments/822225601","html_url":"https://github.com/typeorm/typeorm/issues/5509#issuecomment-822225601","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/typeorm/typeorm/issues/5509","id":822225601,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDgyMjIyNTYwMQ==","user":{"login":"thefat32","id":10998637,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwOTk4NjM3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10998637?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/thefat32","html_url":"https://github.com/thefat32","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thefat32/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thefat32/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thefat32/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thefat32/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thefat32/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thefat32/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thefat32/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thefat32/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thefat32/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-04-19T07:04:34Z","updated_at":"2021-04-19T07:04:34Z","body":"Some
