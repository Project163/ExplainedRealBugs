https://github.com/typeorm/typeorm/issues/2043 but for NestedTree, and maybe the changes from https://github.com/typeorm/typeorm/commit/40b6587157a5ac607d1cc272580987f29d22da6c but applied to https://github.com/typeorm/typeorm/blob/master/src/persistence/tree/NestedSetSubjectExecutor.ts should solve the problem.\r\n\r\nThanks.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n    To answer those questions you need to put
