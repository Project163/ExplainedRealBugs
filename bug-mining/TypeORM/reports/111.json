Connect to a database server using `type: 'postgres'` and `database: 'postgres'`\r\n2. Use `await queryRunner.createDatabase('my-database')` to set up a database\r\n\r\nExpected result: The `my-database` database exists afterwards\r\nActual result: The method did nothing, as can be seen in the plain [`Promise.resolve()` in the QueryRunner implementation](https://github.com/typeorm/typeorm/blob/0280cdc451c35ef73c830eb1191c95d34f6ce06e/src/driver/postgres/PostgresQueryRunner.ts#L288-L302)\r\n\r\nThe same goes for `dropDatabase`\r\n\r\nWhy isn't this implemented? It looks like a technical limitation is what keeps this driver from being able to offer that functionality; In such a case, however, I would expect TypeORM to throw an exception instead to let the caller know that this won't work instead of acting as if we just happily created a database.\r\n\r\nThis silent failure just cost my colleague and me a few hours of debugging and it would have been as easy as:\r\n```\r\nthrow new Error('`createDatabase` is not supported with the \"postgres\" driver - please use a manual query instead')\r\n```\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n    To answer those questions you need to put \"x\" inside the square brackets, for example:\r\n    [x] `mysql`\r\n    [ ] `postgres`\r\n\r\n    Also, please format your code properly (by taking code blocks into ```ts .... ```)\r\n--!>\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"AlexMesser","id":17142628,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MTQyNjI4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17142628?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexMesser","html_url":"https://github.com/AlexMesser","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexMesser/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexMesser/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexMesser/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexMesser/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexMesser/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexMesser/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexMesser/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexMesser/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexMesser/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/typeorm/typeorm/issues/6867/reactions","total_count":3,"+1":3,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/typeorm/typeorm/issues/6867/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
