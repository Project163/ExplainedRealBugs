I also got the migrations to work but only by compiling my code and using .js data-source file. I still can't get the migrations to work using the .ts files. I also can't get the entities path in the data-source file to work and have to declare each entity.\r\n\r\n@SleeveShirtholes  In my example I'm using all TS. In addition to @kylevillegas93 's reply, my data-source.ts looks like\r\n```typescript\r\nimport { DataSource } from 'typeorm';\r\nimport { SqlServerConnectionOptions } from
