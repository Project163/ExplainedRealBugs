It's because foreign keys mapping can't be found. I looked a bit deeper and found that the regex for foreign keys didn't match the `CREATE TABLE` sql because the regex expects a space between `FOREIGN KEY` and the list of columns.\r\nAs stated in SQLite documentation (https://www.sqlite.org/foreignkeys.html), the space is not mandatory:\r\n```sql\r\nCREATE TABLE track(\r\n  trackid     INTEGER, \r\n  trackname   TEXT, \r\n  trackartist INTEGER,\r\n  FOREIGN KEY(trackartist) REFERENCES artist(artistid)\r\n);\r\n```\r\n\r\nI've tested the regex in the code on regex101.com with the example provided by SQLite and it does not match.\r\n\r\n### Expected Behavior\r\nThe regex should handle both space and no-space syntaxes and it should successfully match the `CREATE TABLE` sql to get the foreign keys.\r\n<!--\r\n  A clear and concise description of what you expected to happen.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### Actual Behavior\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n  A clear and concise description of what actually happened.\r\n\r\n  Please wrap any error messages or output in code tags, instead of images.\r\n-->\r\n`Cannot read property 'name' of undefined / AbstractSQLiteQueryRunner.ts`, line 1510.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n  Your bug will be investigated much faster if we can run your code and it doesn't\r\n  have dependencies other than TypeORM.
