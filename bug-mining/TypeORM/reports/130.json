Issues without reproduction steps or\r\n  code examples may be closed as not actionable.\r\n\r\n  Please try to provide a Minimal, Complete, and Verifiable example.\r\n  http://stackoverflow.com/help/mcve\r\n-->\r\n\r\n1. Run `npx typeorm init --name MyProject --database postgres --module esm`\r\n2. Setup ormconfig.json as normal\r\n3. Run the project (`node start`)\r\n\r\n### My Environment\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n  Please add any other relevant dependencies to this table at the end.\r\n  For example: Electron, React Native, or NestJS.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n| Dependency          | ts-node, TypeScript, Typeorm, pg,  reflect-metadata  |\r\n| ---                 | ---      |\r\n| Operating System    | Windows 10         |\r\n| Node.js version     | v17.3.0  | <!-- run `node -v` to obtain this -->\r\n| Typescript version  | 4.5.5  | <!-- run `npm list typescript` to obtain this -->\r\n| TypeORM version     | 0.2.42  | <!-- run `npm list typeorm` to obtain this -->\r\n\r\n\r\n### Additional Context\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n  Add any other context about the bug report here.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### Relevant Database Driver(s)\r\n\r\n<!-- Put \"yes\" instead of \"no\" to your issue's relevant databases -->\r\n\r\n| DB Type              | Reproducible  |\r\n| ---                  | ---           |\r\n| `aurora-data-api`    | no            |\r\n| `aurora-data-api-pg` | no            |\r\n| `better-sqlite3`     | no            |\r\n| `cockroachdb`        | no            |\r\n| `cordova`            | no            |\r\n| `expo`               | no            |\r\n| `mongodb`            | no            |\r\n| `mysql`              | no            |\r\n| `nativescript`       | no            |\r\n| `oracle`             | no            |\r\n| `postgres`           | yes            |\r\n| `react-native`       | no            |\r\n| `sap`                | no            |\r\n| `sqlite`             | no            |\r\n| `sqlite-abstract`    | no            |\r\n| `sqljs`              | no            |\r\n| `sqlserver`          | no            |\r\n\r\n\r\n### Are you willing to resolve this issue by submitting a Pull Request?\r\n\r\n<!-- Put \"✅\" (:white_check_mark:) to one of these options, left \"\" (:heavy_multiplication_x:) others: -->\r\n\r\n - ✖️ Yes, I have the time, and I know how to start.\r\n - ✅ Yes, I have the time, but I don't know how to start.
