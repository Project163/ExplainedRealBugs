UPDATE CURRENT_TIMESTAMP(3)\r\n```\r\nAlthough I could not find any document written about this (my apologies if there is), I managed to generate such a column by\r\n```\r\n@Column('timestamp', { name: 'updated_at', precision: 3, default: () => 'CURRENT_TIMESTAMP(3) ON UPDATE CURRENT_TIMESTAMP(3)' })\r\nupdatedAt?: string;\r\n```\r\nHowever, I think it's a little tricky way for adding `ON UPDATE CURRENT_TIMESTAMP(3)` because it's not a part of `DEFAULT` clause.\r\nIs there any recommended way?\r\n\r\nThanks","closed_by":{"login":"AlexMesser","id":17142628,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MTQyNjI4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17142628?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexMesser","html_url":"https://github.com/AlexMesser","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexMesser/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexMesser/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexMesser/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexMesser/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexMesser/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexMesser/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexMesser/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexMesser/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlexMesser/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/typeorm/typeorm/issues/1901/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/typeorm/typeorm/issues/1901/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
