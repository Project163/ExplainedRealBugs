Still, installation fails unless using `--legacy-peer-deps`.\n\nThis restriction creates unnecessary friction for setups where TypeORM and Redis are both used — independently.\n\n## Suggested fix\n\nRelax the peerOptional range in `package.json`:\n\n```json\n\"redis\": \"^3.1.1 || ^4.0.0 || ^5.0.0\"\n```\n\nOr ideally:\n\n```json\n\"redis\": \"*\"\n```\n\n...since it's an optional peer and not a hard requirement.\n\n## Environment\n\n* typeorm: 0.3.23\n* redis: 5.5.6\n* node: 22.x\n* npm: 10.x","closed_by":{"login":"gioboa","id":35845425,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1ODQ1NDI1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/35845425?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gioboa","html_url":"https://github.com/gioboa","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gioboa/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gioboa/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gioboa/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gioboa/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gioboa/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gioboa/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gioboa/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gioboa/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gioboa/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/typeorm/typeorm/issues/11528/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/typeorm/typeorm/issues/11528/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
