Description of change\r\nThis PR is the result of a conversation at #5371 regarding a bug with TypeOrm and MySQL resulting in the generation of an invalid table create query for enum fields with a default value of `null`\r\nThis happens simply due to treating `null` as another value for the enum and therefore, escaping and passing it as a string to the database.\r\nThe fix was easy, we are already checking for `undefined` before searching in enum and escaping the value in case there was no default value specified, now we are also checking for `null` in case the passed default value is _special_ and should not be treated like others.\r\nThis is done by simply replacing `value !== undefined` with `value != null` therefore checking for both conditions.\r\n\r\n### Pull-Request Checklist\r\n\r\n- [X] Code is up-to-date with the `master` branch\r\n- [ ] `npm run lint` passes with this change\r\n- [ ] `npm run test` passes with this change\r\n- [X] This pull request links relevant issues as `Fixes #0000`\r\n- [ ] There are new or updated unit tests validating the change\r\n- [ ] Documentation has been updated to reflect this change\r\n- [ ] The new commits follow conventions explained in [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/typeorm/typeorm/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)\r\n\r\nThis is a small change and so I did the changes on my browser without setting up the project for test, build, and lint. But honestly, I don't think it can break anything! Feel free to reject it if it doesn't fits the standards!\r\n\r\nThank you for the great
