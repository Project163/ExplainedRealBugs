It offers GridFs for this use case (http://mongodb.github.io/node-mongodb-native/api-articles/nodekoarticle2.html). I don't know how to get mongodb instance from typeorm.\r\n\r\nI get driver instance with following snippet : \r\n\r\n```typescript\r\nimport { getConnection } from 'typeorm';\r\nimport { MongoDriver } from 'typeorm/driver/mongodb/MongoDriver';\r\n\r\nconst connection = getConnection();\r\nconst isMongo = connection.options.type === 'mongodb';\r\n\r\nif (isMongo === true) {\r\n  const driver = connection.driver as MongoDriver;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut when I read the code, I see the mongodb is protected : https://github.com/typeorm/typeorm/blob/60a99772e0ca990f2abcf1ac4c65d2d7054e4e9a/src/driver/mongodb/MongoDriver.ts#L117\r\n\r\nMoreover, `MongoDriver` is not exported in root, I need to pass full path for import it, is it normal ?\r\n\r\nCan you help me to get mongodb instance please ?\r\n\r\nThanks","closed_by":{"login":"pleerock","id":1753397,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NTMzOTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1753397?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pleerock","html_url":"https://github.com/pleerock","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pleerock/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pleerock/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pleerock/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pleerock/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pleerock/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pleerock/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pleerock/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pleerock/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pleerock/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/typeorm/typeorm/issues/3491/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/typeorm/typeorm/issues/3491/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
