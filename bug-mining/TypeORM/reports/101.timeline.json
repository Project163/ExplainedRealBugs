Passing the MongoDB Atlas as URL (mongodb://) lead to the  \r\n`MongoNetworkError: connection X to cluster0-XXXX.mongodb.net:27017 closed` error. Passing the host, port, username, password, database, authSource, and ssl worked. After looking more into it, it seems that only one host is picked up (and it seems to me the parameters are ignored as well) from the URL.\r\n\r\nSince I didn't want to change my environment variable in my environment, I fixed this by creating a method that parses the URL and constructs the options correctly. Here are the details of the implementation in case it becomes handy for anybody else.\r\n\r\n\r\n```\r\nprivate static async connectToDataBase() {\r\n\r\n        const options = {\r\n            useNewUrlParser: true,\r\n            bufferMaxEntries: 0,\r\n            connectTimeoutMS: 60000,\r\n            useUnifiedTopology: true,\r\n            serverSelectionTimeoutMS: 60000\r\n        };\r\n\r\n        const connectionOptions:any = await getConnectionOptions();\r\n        Object.assign(connectionOptions, options);\r\n        Object.assign(connectionOptions, Server.extractDriverOptions(Environment.databaseUrl));\r\n\r\n        try{\r\n            await createConnection();\r\n            logger.info(`Connected to database ${connectionOptions.host}`, Server);\r\n        } catch (error) {\r\n            logger.error(`Failed to connect to database ${connectionOptions.host}: ${error}: ${error.stack}`, Server);\r\n        }\r\n}\r\nprivate static extractDriverOptions (url) {\r\n        const type = url.split(\":\")[0];\r\n        const firstSlashes = url.indexOf(\"//\");\r\n        const preBase = url.substr(firstSlashes + 2);\r\n        const secondSlash = preBase.indexOf(\"/\");\r\n        const base = (secondSlash !== -1) ? preBase.substr(0, secondSlash) : preBase;\r\n        let afterBase = (secondSlash !== -1) ? preBase.substr(secondSlash + 1) : undefined;\r\n        // remove mongodb query params\r\n        if (afterBase && afterBase.indexOf(\"?\") !== -1) {\r\n            afterBase = afterBase.substr(0, afterBase.indexOf(\"?\"));\r\n        }\r\n        const lastAtSign = base.lastIndexOf(\"@\");\r\n        const usernameAndPassword = base.substr(0, lastAtSign);\r\n        const hostAndPort = base.substr(lastAtSign + 1);\r\n        let username = usernameAndPassword;\r\n        let password = \"\";\r\n        const firstColon = usernameAndPassword.indexOf(\":\");\r\n        if (firstColon !== -1) {\r\n            username = usernameAndPassword.substr(0, firstColon);\r\n            password = usernameAndPassword.substr(firstColon + 1);\r\n        }\r\n        const hostAndPortParts = hostAndPort.split(',');\r\n        let part;\r\n        let host;\r\n        let port;\r\n        for (let i=0; i<hostAndPortParts.length; i++) {\r\n            if (i === 0) {\r\n                part = hostAndPortParts[i].split(\":\");\r\n                host = part[0];\r\n                port= part[1];\r\n            } else {\r\n                host = host + \",\" + hostAndPortParts[i].split(\":\")[0];\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        const driverOptions = {\r\n            type: type,\r\n            host: host,\r\n            username: decodeURIComponent(username),\r\n            password: decodeURIComponent(password),\r\n            port: port ? parseInt(port) : undefined,\r\n            database: afterBase || undefined\r\n        };\r\n        const properties = url.split('?')[1]?.split('&');\r\n        let property;\r\n        let value: string;\r\n        for (let i=0; i<properties.length; i++) {\r\n            property = properties[i].split('=')[0];\r\n            value = properties[i].split('=')[1];\r\n            if (value.toLowerCase().indexOf('true') > -1 || value.toLowerCase().indexOf('false') > -1) {\r\n                driverOptions[property] = (value.toLowerCase().indexOf('true') > -1);\r\n            } else {\r\n                driverOptions[property] = value;\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        return driverOptions;\r\n }\r\n```\r\nHere is what my ormconfig.json looks like:\r\n\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  \"type\": \"mongodb\",\r\n  \"synchronize\": false,\r\n  \"logging\": false,\r\n  \"entities\": [\r\n    \"build/entities/**/*.js\"\r\n  ],\r\n  \"cli\": {\r\n     \"entitiesDir\": \"src/entity\"\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\nI am using  \"mongodb\": \"^3.6.3\", \"typeorm\": \"^0.2.29\".\r\n\r\nP.S. Please note that this implementation doesn't account for cases where the configuration has a parameter with a number value (but it is an easy fix to add if you are sending a parameter that has a numeric value in the URL).","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/typeorm/typeorm/issues/comments/740188570/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"Funnelll","id":32591792,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyNTkxNzky","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/32591792?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Funnelll","html_url":"https://github.com/Funnelll","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Funnelll/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Funnelll/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Funnelll/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Funnelll/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Funnelll/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Funnelll/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Funnelll/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Funnelll/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Funnelll/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/typeorm/typeorm/issues/comments/743155915","html_url":"https://github.com/typeorm/typeorm/issues/3347#issuecomment-743155915","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/typeorm/typeorm/issues/3347","id":743155915,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc0MzE1NTkxNQ==","user":{"login":"PierBusDev","id":16228943,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MjI4OTQz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16228943?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/PierBusDev","html_url":"https://github.com/PierBusDev","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PierBusDev/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PierBusDev/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PierBusDev/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PierBusDev/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PierBusDev/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PierBusDev/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PierBusDev/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PierBusDev/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PierBusDev/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-12-11T12:05:50Z","updated_at":"2020-12-18T17:52:08Z","body":"I
