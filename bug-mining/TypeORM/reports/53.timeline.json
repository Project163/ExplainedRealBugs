#4219\r\n\r\nSolution:\r\n\r\n- First check if a `typeFunction` is passed to a decorator and then pass `typeFunction` to `@Type` (this is the current behavior)\r\n- If no `typeFunction` is passed and \"reflect-metadata\" is imported, try to use `design:type`\r\n\r\nSo for example:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\n@Entity()\r\nexport class Photo {\r\n     \r\n    // ...\r\n\r\n    @CreateDateColumn()\r\n    createdAt: Date;\r\n\r\n}\r\n\r\n// ...\r\n\r\nconst photo = plainToClass(Photo, {\r\n  //...\r\n  createdAt: 'Sat Jun 01 2019'\r\n});\r\n\r\nphoto.createdAt instanceof Date // true\r\n```\r\n\r\nJust
