@holm: I don't think we should close this issue yet. I think having a dry-run option for `typeorm migration:run` is still very useful to have. PR #6978 is not implementing a dry-run option.\r\n\r\nSomething like the following could print out the queries that will be generated:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nnpm run typeorm migration:run --dry\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt's especially useful when we use the built-in helper functions instead of manually writing SQL:\r\n```js\r\npublic async up(queryRunner: QueryRunner): Promise<void> {\r\n    await queryRunner.addColumn('episodes',  new TableColumn({\r\n        name: \"date_deleted\",\r\n        type: \"datetime\",\r\n        isNullable: true,\r\n        default: null,\r\n    }));\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor me personally, I just want to be able to print out the resulting queries that will be executed to `stdout` without doing a round-trip to the database. To do a quick sanity check if the resulting series of DDL operations look okay. Maybe it's better to always just write manual queries? 🤔

The proposal to (also) add a \"check\" mode makes sense, so I have added that here, but kept backwards compatibility when the new flag is not used.\r\n\r\nIn addition there was a feeling that the original issue, https://github.com/typeorm/typeorm/issues/3037, was not resolved, and rightly so. So I have also added a \"dryrun\" mode that will print out the migration instead of writing it to a file.\r\n\r\nHopefully fixes #3037 \r\n\r\n### Pull-Request Checklist\r\n\r\n- [X] Code is
