databases created with any version (<= 0.2.14) that contained:\r\n- uppercase letters in the table names.\r\n- at least one enum in one of those tables.\r\n\r\n```\r\n{ QueryFailedError: type \"transaction.detail_type_enum\" does not exist\r\n    at new QueryFailedError (.../src/error/QueryFailedError.ts:9:9)\r\n    at Query.callback

enums before this version, it kept uppercase letters from the table name when generating the enum type name, it no longer does.\r\n\r\nMy pull-request corrected the missing quotes in the driver that were causing the crash when uppercase letters existed in enums names.\r\n\r\n@onionhammer pull-request corrected the same problem by keeping bad quoting, but lowercasing all enum names.\r\n\r\nAccepting both patches into the 0.2.15 version cause typeorm to **both** lowercase and quote the enum type, which result in the enum type not being found, and crashing again.\r\n\r\nBoth solutions were OK but don't play well together","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/typeorm/typeorm/issues/3828/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/typeorm/typeorm/issues/3828/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
