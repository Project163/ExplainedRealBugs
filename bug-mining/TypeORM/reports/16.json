I see the docs on how to create an enum (which I got working) and the example on how to create an array (which I got working with strings). I would, however, like to create an array of enums. I'm currently trying this:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nexport enum Role {\r\n    admin = 'admin',\r\n    manager = 'manager',\r\n    leader = 'leader',\r\n    contributor = 'contributor',\r\n}\r\n\r\n...\r\n\r\n  @Column('enum', { enum: ['admin', 'manager', 'leader', 'contributor'], array: true })\r\n  roles: Role[];\r\n```\r\n\r\nHow do I create such a type for this entity? I'm essentially shooting for:\r\n\r\n```\r\nCREATE TYPE enum_type AS ENUM ('value1', 'value2');\r\nCREATE TABLE table ( enum_array_type enum_type[] );\r\n```","closed_by":{"login":"pleerock","id":1753397,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NTMzOTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1753397?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pleerock","html_url":"https://github.com/pleerock","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pleerock/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pleerock/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pleerock/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pleerock/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pleerock/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pleerock/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pleerock/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pleerock/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pleerock/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/typeorm/typeorm/issues/2081/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/typeorm/typeorm/issues/2081/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
