encountered this bug as well. I debugged into TypeORM and figured out that it was caused by the update of package [glob](https://github.com/isaacs/node-glob), which is responsible for resolving the glob pattern used in the entity configuration.  \r\nAs mentioned in [this issue](https://github.com/isaacs/node-glob/issues/480), the update breaks its compatibility on Windows, interpreting \"\\\\\" as an escape character instead of a valid path separator.  \r\nThis is the origin of this bug, but another point also contributes to this problem: TypeORM will normalize the path before passing it to glob ([util/DirectoryExportedClassesLoader](https://github.com/typeorm/typeorm/blob/master/src/util/DirectoryExportedClassesLoader.ts#L76)), which will replace all forward slashes with backslashes (because backslash is the primary path separator on Windows). That's why this bug will still occur even if you use forward slashes in your config file.","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/typeorm/typeorm/issues/comments/1423807786/reactions","total_count":26,"+1":9,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":14,"rocket":3,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"truemogician","id":33447608,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzNDQ3NjA4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/33447608?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/truemogician","html_url":"https://github.com/truemogician","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/truemogician/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/truemogician/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/truemogician/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/truemogician/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/truemogician/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/truemogician/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/truemogician/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/truemogician/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/truemogician/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":8476785831,"node_id":"REFE_lADOAyVBJc5eAAVAzwAAAAH5QXyn","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/typeorm/typeorm/issues/events/8476785831","actor":{"login":"truemogician","id":33447608,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzNDQ3NjA4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/33447608?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/truemogician","html_url":"https://github.com/truemogician","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/truemogician/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/truemogician/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/truemogician/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/truemogician/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/truemogician/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/truemogician/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/truemogician/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/truemogician/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/truemogician/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"b3c7116021e8023996604b9bf994f9c2e5aed8dd","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/truemogician/typeorm/commits/b3c7116021e8023996604b9bf994f9c2e5aed8dd","created_at":"2023-02-09T08:38:54Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":8476828614,"node_id":"REFE_lADOAyVBJc5eAAVAzwAAAAH5QiPG","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/typeorm/typeorm/issues/events/8476828614","actor":{"login":"truemogician","id":33447608,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzNDQ3NjA4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/33447608?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/truemogician","html_url":"https://github.com/truemogician","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/truemogician/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/truemogician/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/truemogician/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/truemogician/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/truemogician/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/truemogician/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/truemogician/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/truemogician/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/truemogician/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"966ae57f81af02dc1c0f7a908ee62205e67f5cf4","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/truemogician/typeorm/commits/966ae57f81af02dc1c0f7a908ee62205e67f5cf4","created_at":"2023-02-09T08:44:11Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":8476840435,"node_id":"REFE_lADOAyVBJc5eAAVAzwAAAAH5QlHz","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/typeorm/typeorm/issues/events/8476840435","actor":{"login":"truemogician","id":33447608,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzNDQ3NjA4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/33447608?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/truemogician","html_url":"https://github.com/truemogician","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/truemogician/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/truemogician/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/truemogician/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/truemogician/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/truemogician/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/truemogician/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/truemogician/repos","events_url":"https:
