If the function is deprecated I would expect it to be marked as deprecated or deleted.\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nhttps://github.com/typeorm/typeorm/blob/master/src/find-options/FindOptionsUtils.ts#L85 The function here named `applyFindManyOptionsOrConditionsToQueryBuilder` is commented out. If that is not intentional, I would expect it to be uncommented out.
