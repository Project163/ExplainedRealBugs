I think the issue was hidden by the platform tools change - the dummy drivers that get injected for browser aren't being for sqlite3 and bettersqlite3.\r\n\r\nI sure hope there's a case where we can eventually split up the project some so the drivers can be installed separately  - negating the need for hacks.\r\n\r\nThere's also a location where glob is being pulled in for browser which .. shouldn't be.  I'll be digging into that some.","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/typeorm/typeorm/issues/comments/695042799/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"imnotjames","id":1551593,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1NTE1OTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1551593?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/imnotjames","html_url":"https://github.com/imnotjames","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imnotjames/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imnotjames/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imnotjames/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imnotjames/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imnotjames/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imnotjames/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imnotjames/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imnotjames/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imnotjames/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":3784690733,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDM3ODQ2OTA3MzM=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/typeorm/typeorm/issues/events/3784690733","actor":{"login":"imnotjames","id":1551593,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1NTE1OTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1551593?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/imnotjames","html_url":"https://github.com/imnotjames","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imnotjames/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imnotjames/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imnotjames/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imnotjames/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imnotjames/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imnotjames/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imnotjames/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imnotjames/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imnotjames/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"5a04890f70b06d50f1c377c1a36b87e7f392f2d8","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/imnotjames/typeorm/commits/5a04890f70b06d50f1c377c1a36b87e7f392f2d8","created_at":"2020-09-19T02:29:39Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"actor":{"login":"imnotjames","id":1551593,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1NTE1OTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1551593?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/imnotjames","html_url":"https://github.com/imnotjames","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imnotjames/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imnotjames/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imnotjames/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imnotjames/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imnotjames/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imnotjames/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imnotjames/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imnotjames/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imnotjames/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-09-19T02:30:16Z","updated_at":"2020-09-19T02:30:16Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/typeorm/typeorm/issues/6743","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/typeorm/typeorm","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/typeorm/typeorm/issues/6743/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/typeorm/typeorm/issues/6743/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/typeorm/typeorm/issues/6743/events","html_url":"https://github.com/typeorm/typeorm/pull/6743","id":704762252,"node_id":"MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0NDg5NjI5MTE1","number":6743,"title":"fix:
