I have to [transpile module](https://github.com/Project-Setup/github_sql_pwa/blob/typeorm-0.2.25/next.config.js#L4) `typeorm/browser` at build time to generate static HTML files. This had been working until Typeorm upgraded to 0.2.25.\r\n\r\nHere's the example repo: https://github.com/Project-Setup/github_sql_pwa/tree/typeorm-0.2.25\r\nTo reproduce:\r\n1. git clone the repo\r\n2. set up node environment\r\n    ```sh\r\n    nvm install; nvm use; npm install\r\n    ```\r\n3. build pages\r\n    ```sh\r\n    npm run build\r\n    ```\r\n\r\nan error will come out:\r\n```\r\nCreating an optimized production build  \r\n\r\nFailed to compile.\r\n\r\n./node_modules/typeorm/browser/driver/DriverFactory.js\r\nAttempted import error: 'AuroraDataApiPostgresDriver' is not exported from './postgres/PostgresDriver'.\r\n\r\n\r\n> Build error occurred\r\nError: > Build failed because of webpack errors\r\n```\r\n\r\nReverting Typeorm to 0.2.24 will fix the issue.\r\n\r\nI think the issue lies in typescript declaration file `node_modules/typeorm/browser/driver/postgres/PostgresDriver.d.ts`. It may have a problem exporting multiple classes under the current setup, but I wasn't sure.","closed_by":{"login":"pleerock","id":1753397,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NTMzOTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1753397?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pleerock","html_url":"https://github.com/pleerock","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pleerock/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pleerock/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pleerock/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pleerock/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pleerock/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pleerock/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pleerock/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pleerock/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pleerock/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/typeorm/typeorm/issues/6110/reactions","total_count":10,"+1":10,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/typeorm/typeorm/issues/6110/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
