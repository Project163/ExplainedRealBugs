Fix [issue 6168](https://github.com/typeorm/typeorm/issues/6168), where the foreign key queried might be wrong. There is already another open PR for this issue: [PR 6169](https://github.com/typeorm/typeorm/pull/6169/files)\r\n\r\nloadTables performs queries to INFORMATION_SCHEMA, which is not optimized.\r\nMySQL recommends adding a where clause with the schema and table for better performance - https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/information-schema-optimization.html.\r\n\r\nThere are 2 queries with a JOIN that have a where clause on the schema and table, but the where clause is only for one of the tables in the join.\r\nIn the foreign key query, this causes an actual bug (which is what https://github.com/typeorm/typeorm/pull/6169/files solves).\r\n\r\nFor large databases with many schemas, this can be a crucial improvement.\r\nIn our database, for example, it improved each query from about **7.5 seconds** to around **200 milliseconds**.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/typeorm/typeorm/issues/6799/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/typeorm/typeorm/issues/6799/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":3827434576,"node_id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDM4Mjc0MzQ1NzY=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/typeorm/typeorm/issues/events/3827434576","actor":{"login":"imnotjames","id":1551593,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1NTE1OTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1551593?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/imnotjames","html_url":"https://github.com/imnotjames","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imnotjames/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imnotjames/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imnotjames/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imnotjames/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imnotjames/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imnotjames/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imnotjames/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imnotjames/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imnotjames/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-10-01T04:29:54Z","label":{"name":"bug","color":"fc2929"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3827434579,"node_id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDM4Mjc0MzQ1Nzk=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/typeorm/typeorm/issues/events/3827434579","actor":{"login":"imnotjames","id":1551593,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1NTE1OTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1551593?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/imnotjames","html_url":"https://github.com/imnotjames","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imnotjames/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imnotjames/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imnotjames/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imnotjames/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imnotjames/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imnotjames/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imnotjames/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imnotjames/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imnotjames/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-10-01T04:29:54Z","label":{"name":"driver:

needs the condition to be where it is here in order to later add the performance fix.\r\n\r\nThe foreign key query has a JOIN and a where clause on the schema and table names, but the where clause is only for one of the tables in the join. This way in a multi-tenanted environment, it's possible for several schemas to have the same foreign key name, resulting in duplicate results in the
