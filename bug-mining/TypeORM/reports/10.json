The most important thing is that i cannot find any doc mention that.\r\n\r\nYou could reproduce this problem using the init project and set sql mode to `ANSI` or `something` other than default.\r\n\r\nOf course, when not changing sql mode or the sql mode not effecting the quote string? i guess, this problem will be fixed. \r\n\r\nI think we may add feature to reflex the sql mode change or add doc to remind user not changing the sql mode.\r\n\r\nAnyway, thank you for the awesome project. 👍 \r\n\r\n<!--\r\n    To answer those questions you need to put \"x\" inside the square brackets, for example:\r\n    [x] `mysql`\r\n    [ ] `postgres`\r\n\r\n    Also, please format your code properly (by taking code blocks into ```ts .... ```)\r\n!>\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"pleerock","id":1753397,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NTMzOTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1753397?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pleerock","html_url":"https://github.com/pleerock","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pleerock/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pleerock/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pleerock/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pleerock/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pleerock/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pleerock/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pleerock/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pleerock/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pleerock/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/typeorm/typeorm/issues/2018/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/typeorm/typeorm/issues/2018/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
