We are using an enum and this is postgres.\r\n```ts\r\n@TableInheritance({\r\n type: \"enum\",\r\n enum: UserRole\r\n})\r\nclass User {}\r\n\r\n@ChildEntity(UserRole.BASIC_USER)\r\nclass BasicUser {}\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow the issue:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nconst user = await repository.findOne(id);\r\nconsole.log(user.Role) // \"BASIC_USER\"\r\n\r\nuser.Role = UserRole.ADMIN\r\nconst saved = entityManager.save(user); // can't use the UserRepository (see #2927)\r\n\r\nconsole.log(saved); // { ..., role: \"ADMIN\" }\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut when I look at the database, I don't see the change. I can't dump the query output since I have some work-specific details but I can tell you that there are NO update statements when I change the discriminator. It only selects.\r\n\r\nSo can you not change the discriminator? I will try to do it through query builder which I imagine will work. \r\nI haven't tried it yet, but I imagine if I choose the right Repository (ie. `Repository<BasicUser>` instead of `Repository<User>`) I can change it maybe?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/typeorm/typeorm/issues/2932/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/typeorm/typeorm/issues/2932/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":1928475907,"node_id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDE5Mjg0NzU5MDc=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/typeorm/typeorm/issues/events/1928475907","actor":{"login":"Kononnable","id":9082099,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkwODIwOTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9082099?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kononnable","html_url":"https://github.com/Kononnable","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kononnable/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kononnable/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kononnable/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kononnable/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kononnable/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kononnable/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kononnable/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kononnable/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kononnable/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-10-26T10:26:55Z","label":{"name":"comp:

What about performance problems?\r\n* Should this behaviour be deactivatable?\r\n* Is there any documentation that has to be updated?\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes #2927 (which was closed by the author without the problem being resolved).\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n  Please be clear and concise what the change is intended to do,\r\n  why this change is needed, and how you've verified that it\r\n  corrects what you
