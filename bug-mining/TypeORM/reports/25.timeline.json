that it looks like:\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  _: [ 'migration:generate', 'initial' ], // extra element\r\n  config: 'ormconfig.json',\r\n  f: 'ormconfig.json',\r\n  n: true, // bolean\r\n  name: true, //boolean\r\n  c: 'default',\r\n  connection: 'default',\r\n  '$0': 'node_modules/typeorm/cli.js'\r\n }\r\n```\r\nwhen it should look like:\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  _: [ 'migration:generate' ],\r\n  config: 'ormconfig.json',\r\n  f: 'ormconfig.json',\r\n  n: 'initial', //string\r\n  name: 'initial', //string\r\n  c: 'default',\r\n  connection: 'default',\r\n  '$0': 'node_modules/typeorm/cli.js'\r\n }\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe latter object is produced when running the package.json scripts, and String.replace is attempting to run on args.name, which is now a boolean.\r\n\r\nNode command: ```node migration.js initial```\r\nNPM command: ```npm run typeorm:migrate initial```\r\n\r\n```\r\n// package.json\r\n{\r\n  ...,\r\n  scripts: {\r\n  ...,\r\n    \"typeorm\": \"ts-node -r

This then results in the aforementioned `TypeError: str.replace is not a function` error when `name` is passed into the `camelCase` method.\r\n\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  _: [ 'migration:generate' ],\r\n  f: 'ormconfig',\r\n  config: 'ormconfig',\r\n  c: 'development',\r\n  connection: 'development',\r\n  n: true,\r\n  name: true,\r\n  '$0': 'node_modules/.bin/typeorm'\r\n}\r\nboolean\r\nError during migration generation:\r\nTypeError: str.replace is not a function\r\n    at Object.camelCase (/Users/aasante/h-dev/TradeMachine/trade-machine-server/node_modules/typeorm/util/StringUtils.js:12:16)\r\n    at Function.MigrationGenerateCommand.getTemplate (/Users/aasante/h-dev/TradeMachine/trade-machine-server/node_modules/typeorm/commands/MigrationGenerateCommand.js:168:48)\r\n    at Object.<anonymous> (/Users/aasante/h-dev/TradeMachine/trade-machine-server/node_modules/typeorm/commands/MigrationGenerateCommand.js:117:64)\r\n    at step (/Users/aasante/h-dev/TradeMachine/trade-machine-server/node_modules/tslib/tslib.js:136:27)\r\n    at Object.next (/Users/aasante/h-dev/TradeMachine/trade-machine-server/node_modules/tslib/tslib.js:117:57)\r\n    at fulfilled (/Users/aasante/h-dev/TradeMachine/trade-machine-server/node_modules/tslib/tslib.js:107:62)\r\n    at processTicksAndRejections (internal/process/task_queues.js:93:5)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe goal of this PR is to improve the messaging returned to the user in this case; hopefully making it more obvious how to resolve.\r\n\r\nPrevious work was done in this area to return a message if the `name` argument is empty: https://github.com/typeorm/typeorm/pull/2752/commits/e68538ab0dd63c23d24ccf93bb8c5cd3be525de6\r\nbut it doesn't work here because of the argument being coerced into a boolean value.\r\n\r\nThis PR adds the `type: \"string\"` to the `name` argument options passed to `yarg`. This tells the `yarg` library to treat this argument as a string at all times, and a missing value will be interpreted as an empty string, rather than a positional argument. With this PR we get the following:\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  _: [ 'migration:generate' ],\r\n  f: 'ormconfig',\r\n  config: 'ormconfig',\r\n  c: 'development',\r\n  connection: 'development',\r\n  n: '',\r\n  name: '',\r\n  '$0': 'node_modules/.bin/typeorm'\r\n}\r\nPlease specify a migration name using the `-n` argument\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Note to maintainers:** I am happy to add tests if wanted; but I wasn't able to find any existing tests for what's returned by the various CLI commands; and this was a fairly small change. \r\n\r\nCloses (or at least, resolves the confusion brought up by): #2719, #4798, #4805","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/typeorm/typeorm/issues/6690/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/typeorm/typeorm/issues/6690/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":3810390835,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDM4MTAzOTA4MzU=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/typeorm/typeorm/issues/events/3810390835","actor":{"login":"pleerock","id":1753397,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NTMzOTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1753397?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pleerock","html_url":"https://github.com/pleerock","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pleerock/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pleerock/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pleerock/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pleerock/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pleerock/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pleerock/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pleerock/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pleerock/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pleerock/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"dfcb2db216d6ed33946dfa190e19eb14c0fed390","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/typeorm/typeorm/commits/dfcb2db216d6ed33946dfa190e19eb14c0fed390","created_at":"2020-09-26T07:57:20Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":4195758513,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDQxOTU3NTg1MTM=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/typeorm/typeorm/issues/events/4195758513","actor":{"login":"zaro","id":135646,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNTY0Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/135646?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zaro","html_url":"https://github.com/zaro","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zaro/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zaro/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zaro/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zaro/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zaro/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zaro/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zaro/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zaro/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zaro/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"526a21a17c5e2664ebaf70934842a2917ff5d208","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zaro/typeorm/commits/526a21a17c5e2664ebaf70934842a2917ff5d208","created_at":"2021-01-12T13:01:16Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/typeorm/typeorm/issues/comments/805994118","html_url":"https://github.com/typeorm/typeorm/issues/2719#issuecomment-805994118","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/typeorm/typeorm/issues/2719","id":805994118,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDgwNTk5NDExOA==","user":{"login":"navin-a11y","id":69986892,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY5OTg2ODky","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/69986892?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/navin-a11y","html_url":"https://github.com/navin-a11y","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/navin-a11y/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/navin-a11y/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/navin-a11y/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/navin-a11y/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/navin-a11y/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/navin-a11y/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/navin-a11y/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/navin-a11y/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/navin-a11y/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-03-24T16:56:46Z","updated_at":"2021-03-24T16:56:46Z","body":"Hi I was facing the same issue while creating any new migration file.
