However, for \"varchar,\" it appears to conflict with \"nvarchar,\" leading to the wrong data type being used in queries.\n\nAs a result, runtime data conversion occurs, significantly impacting query performance (our application crashed under high load due to this issue).\n\nFor now, we're using a workaround by executing raw queries and manually handling SQL parameters. This resolved the performance issue, but it should be handled by the ORM itself.\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\n\n1. Define a varchar column\n```\n@Index()\n@Column({ type: 'varchar', nullable: true })\n memberId: string | null\n```\n\n2. Query the entity with where condition on that column\n```\nthis.somEntityRepo.find({ where: { memberId: \"someValue\" } })\n```\nOn a large dataset, you can verify the resources used by this query.\n\n---\n\nWorkaround which resolved the performance issue\n```\n await this.connection.query(`SELECT * FROM \"someEntity\" WHERE \"memberId\" = ${'someValue'}`)\n```\n\n\n### My Environment\n\n| Dependency          | Version  |\n| ---                 | ---      |\n| Node.js version     | 20.16.0  |\n| Typescript version  | 5.5.4 |\n| TypeORM version     | 0.3.20 |\n| mssql     | 10.0.4 |\n\n\n### Additional Context\n\n_No response_\n\n### Relevant Database Driver(s)\n\n- [ ] aurora-mysql\n- [ ] aurora-postgres\n- [ ] better-sqlite3\n- [ ] cockroachdb\n- [ ] cordova\n- [ ] expo\n- [ ] mongodb\n- [ ] mysql\n- [ ] nativescript\n- [ ] oracle\n- [ ] postgres\n- [ ] react-native\n- [ ] sap\n- [ ] spanner\n- [ ] sqlite\n- [ ] sqlite-abstract\n- [ ] sqljs\n- [x] sqlserver\n\n### Are you willing to resolve this issue by submitting a Pull Request?\n\nYes, I have the time, but I don't know how to start. I would need guidance.","closed_by":{"login":"naorpeled","id":6171622,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYxNzE2MjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6171622?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/naorpeled","html_url":"https://github.com/naorpeled","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/naorpeled/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/naorpeled/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/naorpeled/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/naorpeled/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/naorpeled/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/naorpeled/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/naorpeled/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/naorpeled/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/naorpeled/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/typeorm/typeorm/issues/11285/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/typeorm/typeorm/issues/11285/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
