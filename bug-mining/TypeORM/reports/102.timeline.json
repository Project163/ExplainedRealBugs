Thus saving the entity will remove the link between the entity and the relation. Just loading and saving an entity without actively manipulating it changed the state of the database.\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n`game.entity.ts` with nullable `ManyToOne` relation `creator`\r\n\r\n```typescript\r\nimport { Entity, JoinColumn, ManyToOne, PrimaryGeneratedColumn } from 'typeorm';\r\nimport { User } from './user.entity';\r\n\r\n@Entity()\r\nexport class Game {\r\n\r\n\t@PrimaryGeneratedColumn()\r\n\tid!: number;\r\n\r\n\t// some more relations and columns\r\n\r\n\t@ManyToOne(() => User, user => user.createdGames, { nullable: true })\r\n\t@JoinColumn()\r\n\tcreator!: User | null;\r\n\r\n\t@Column()\r\n\tfinished: boolean;\r\n\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n`user.entity.ts`\r\n\r\n```typescript\r\nimport { Entity, OneToMany, PrimaryGeneratedColumn } from 'typeorm';\r\nimport { Game } from './game.entity';\r\n\r\n@Entity()\r\nexport class User {\r\n\r\n\t@PrimaryGeneratedColumn()\r\n\tid!: number;\r\n\r\n\t@OneToMany(() => Game, game => game.creator)\r\n\tcreatedGames!: Game[];\r\n\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n`game.repository.ts`\r\n\r\n```typescript\r\nimport { EntityRepository, Repository } from 'typeorm';\r\nimport { Game } from './game.entity';\r\n\r\n@EntityRepository(Game)\r\nexport class GameRepository extends Repository<Game> {}\r\n```\r\n\r\nRetrieval of the entity (just in case it might matter, I added the `WHERE`s and as comment some joins):\r\n\r\n```typescript\r\nconst game: Game | undefined = await this.gameRepository\r\n\t.createQueryBuilder('g')\r\n\t// several innerJoinAndSelect / leftJoinAndSelect here, but none for g.creator\r\n\t.where('g.id = :gameId', { gameId })\r\n\t.andWhere('g.finished = FALSE')\r\n\t.getOne();\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf the game with the given id `gameId` has a creator set in the database, `game.creator` will be `null`. (I guess it will always be `null`).\r\n\r\nThus running\r\n```typescript\r\nawait this.gameRepository.save(game);\r\n```\r\nwill result in an update of the game in the database, setting the foreign key to its creator to `NULL`.\r\n\r\n### My Environment\r\n\r\n| Dependency          | Version  |\r\n| ---                 | ---      |\r\n| Operating System    | Ubuntu 20.04.3 (inside Windows 10 20H2 WSL) |\r\n| Node.js version     | 16.13.1  |\r\n| Typescript version  | 4.4.4  |\r\n| TypeORM version     | 0.2.38  |\r\n| TypeORM version     | 0.2.38  |\r\n| @nestjs/typeorm version     | 8.0.2  |\r\n| @nestjs/core and @nestjs/common | 8.1.1 |\r\n\r\n`npm ls typescript` also shows 4.3.5 as dependency of @nestjs/cli@8.1.4\r\n\r\n### Relevant Database Driver(s)\r\n\r\n<!-- Put \"yes\" instead of \"no\" to your issue's relevant databases -->\r\n\r\n| DB Type              | Reproducible  |\r\n| ---                  | ---           |\r\n| `aurora-data-api`    | no            |\r\n| `aurora-data-api-pg` | no            |\r\n| `better-sqlite3`     | no            |\r\n| `cockroachdb`        | no            |\r\n| `cordova`            | no            |\r\n| `expo`               | no            |\r\n| `mongodb`            | no            |\r\n| `mysql`              | yes |\r\n| `nativescript`       | no            |\r\n| `oracle`             | no            |\r\n| `postgres`           | no            |\r\n| `react-native`       | no            |\r\n| `sap`                | no            |\r\n| `sqlite`             | no            |\r\n| `sqlite-abstract`    | no            |\r\n| `sqljs`              | no            |\r\n| `sqlserver`          | no            |\r\n\r\n\r\n### Are you willing to resolve this issue by submitting a Pull Request?\r\n\r\n<!-- Put \"✅\" (:white_check_mark:) to one of these options, left \"✖️\" (:heavy_multiplication_x:) others: -->\r\n\r\n - ✖️ Yes, I have the time, and I know how to start.\r\n - ✖️ Yes, I have the time, but I don't know how to start.
