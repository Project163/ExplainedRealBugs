Create an entity with a `ManyToOne` relation to another entity\r\n1. Generate the migration and synchronize to the database\r\n1. Change the schema for the entity\r\n1. Change the `ManyToOne` relation `onUpdate` and/or `onDelete` values\r\n1. Generate the migration for the new schema\r\n1. Apply the migration\r\n1. Generate a new migration. Due to the wrong information loaded the `onUpdate` or `onDelete` values might come from the wrong schema and generate an unnecessary foreign key recreation\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"imnotjames","id":1551593,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1NTE1OTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1551593?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/imnotjames","html_url":"https://github.com/imnotjames","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imnotjames/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imnotjames/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imnotjames/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imnotjames/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imnotjames/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imnotjames/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imnotjames/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imnotjames/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imnotjames/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/typeorm/typeorm/issues/6168/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/typeorm/typeorm/issues/6168/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
