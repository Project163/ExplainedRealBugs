Thank you for reporting bugs!\r\n\r\nFirst of all, please star our repo. Your support is vital to the continued maintenance of SeaORM.\r\n\r\nWant to ask a question? You can reach us via:\r\n\r\n- Discord: https://discord.com/invite/uCPdDXzbdv\r\n- GitHub Discussions: https://github.com/SeaQL/sea-orm/discussions/new\r\n\r\nPlease make sure that you are not asking for a missing feature; a bug is incorrect behavior -\r\neither in the feature specification or implementation.\r\n\r\nPlease also make sure your description is clear and precise - maintainers don't have access to your\r\ncode and can't see what you have seen. Please avoid vague descriptions like \"they are different\"\r\nor \"the program crashes\" - in either case, provide exact information.\r\n\r\nIf you are certain there is a bug, please provide a reproducible example, which helps the investigator\r\nto pin-point the bug and the implementor to verify that a solution is satisfactory. Bug reports without \r\nreproducible example may be closed immediately or dangle forever.\r\n\r\nFinally, please search for existing issues and discussions before submission. Feel free to revive old\r\nthreads if you have new information to add, but please don't ask for ETA or \"+1\".\r\n\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## Description\r\n\r\nCreate an enumeration, an error `proc-macro derive panicked message: \"\"` occurs when inputting most non-English languages as its value.\r\n\r\n## Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n1. Add SeaORM version 0.12.0 or above to the project.\r\n2. Use the command `sea-orm-cli generate entity -u sqlite://any.sqlite` to create any entity.\r\n3. Add an enumeration to the created table and use a non-English language as its value.\r\n\r\n### Expected Behavior\r\n\r\nThe enumeration should be able to handle all supported characters without any errors.\r\n\r\n### Actual Behavior\r\n\r\nAn error occurs when most non-English languages are used as the enumeration value: `proc-macro derive panicked message: \"\"`.\r\n\r\n### Reproduces How Often\r\n\r\nThe issue is consistently reproducible.\r\n\r\n### Workarounds\r\n\r\nNo workaround has been identified yet.\r\n\r\n## Reproducible Example\r\n\r\nPlease refer to this example link: [Reproducible Example](https://github.com/byeblack/enum_error_example)\r\n```rust\r\n#[derive(Clone, Debug, PartialEq, Eq, EnumIter, DeriveActiveEnum)]\r\n#[sea_orm(rs_type = \"String\", db_type = \"String(None)\", enum_name = \"status\")]\r\npub enum Status {\r\n    // #[sea_orm(string_value = \"Open\")]\r\n    // #[sea_orm(string_value = \"열려 있는\")]\r\n\r\n    // The following situations\r\n    // proc-macro derive panicked message: `\"\"` is not a valid identifier\r\n    #[sea_orm(string_value = \"打开\")]\r\n    // #[sea_orm(string_value = \"開ける\")]\r\n    // #[sea_orm(string_value = \"Нээлттэй\")]\r\n    // #[sea_orm(string_value = \"Открыть\")]\r\n    // #[sea_orm(string_value = \"يفتح\")]\r\n    Open,\r\n    #[sea_orm(string_value = \"Close\")]\r\n    Close,\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Versions\r\n\r\nSeaORM version: 0.12.0 and above.  \r\n","closed_by":{"login":"tyt2y3","id":1782664,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3ODI2NjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1782664?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tyt2y3","html_url":"https://github.com/tyt2y3","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tyt2y3/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tyt2y3/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tyt2y3/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tyt2y3/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tyt2y3/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tyt2y3/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tyt2y3/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tyt2y3/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tyt2y3/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/SeaQL/sea-orm/issues/1851/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/SeaQL/sea-orm/issues/1851/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
