compiling the 2.0.x branch, the compilation fails at the module `rdf4j-spin-sail` because of a test failure.\n\nThe code below is an actual test report.\n\n```\nRunning org.eclipse.rdf4j.sail.spin.SpifSailTest\nTests run: 13, Failures: 1, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0, Time elapsed: 48.194 sec <<< FAILURE! - in

actual value contains the word \"febbraio\", which is the Italian word for February. \n\nThe code below should be the failing test case.\n\n```\nspif:Test-dateFormat-1\n  rdf:type spl:TestCase ;\n  spl:testExpression [\n      rdf:type spif:dateFormat ;\n      arg:date \"2008-02-13\"^^xsd:date ;\n      arg:pattern \"MMMMMMMMM dd, yyyy\" ;\n    ] ;\n  spl:testResult \"febbraio 13, 2008\"^^xsd:string ;\n  rdfs:label \"Test-date format\"^^xsd:string ;\n.\n```\n\nIndeed, it requires that the structured date `\"2008-02-13\"^^xsd:date` is formatted according to the template `\"MMMMMMMMM dd, yyyy\"`.\n\nThe implementation of `spif:dateFormat` seems to use the default locale, which explains the observed behavior.\n\nIf the implementation is right, then the tests should be updated to avoid the failure.\n","closed_by":{"login":"abrokenjester","id":728776,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcyODc3Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/728776?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/abrokenjester","html_url":"https://github.com/abrokenjester","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abrokenjester/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abrokenjester/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abrokenjester/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abrokenjester/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abrokenjester/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abrokenjester/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abrokenjester/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abrokenjester/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abrokenjester/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-rdf4j/rdf4j/issues/280/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-rdf4j/rdf4j/issues/280/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
