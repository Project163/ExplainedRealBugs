compile works fine, but maven package abort on rio test . trace below.\r\nErrors comes from a translated error message returned by rio ( my PC is a french one ). \r\nI don't know how to tell the test to work in english, neither where it took the language. \r\nAs a workaround, i can comment the assert, but it could be better to find how to enforce current language in english or to have multilanguage assert in a case .\r\n\r\n### i found issue #280 and #284 and do a **mvn install -Dmaven.test.skip=true** that works without running tests.
