I saw a couple of issues related to this: #2826 and #1016. My issue seems to be slightly different though - it happens when a property on a stdClass object is accessed more than once, and it only seems to happen with results from PDO:\r\n\r\n```php\r\n<?php\r\n\r\n$db = new PDO('');\r\n$q = $db->prepare('');\r\n$q->execute();\r\n$o = $q->fetch(PDO::FETCH_OBJ);\r\n$o && ($o->p || $o->p); // Uncaught InvalidArgumentException: Could not get class storage for stdclass\r\n```\r\n\r\nHere's the failing case on psalm.dev: https://psalm.dev/r/816787d4b3\r\nHere's a passing case with only one `$o->p` access: https://psalm.dev/r/1918607874\r\nHere's a similar chunk of code using a plain `stdClass` constructor: https://psalm.dev/r/0d6d9aae0a","closed_by":{"login":"muglug","id":2292638,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyOTI2Mzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2292638?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug","html_url":"https://github.com/muglug","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vimeo/psalm/issues/5099/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vimeo/psalm/issues/5099/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
