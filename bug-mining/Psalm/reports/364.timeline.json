following code is a reduced scenario from what usually happens with a Doctrine ORM + custom DBAL type setup:\r\n\r\n```php\r\n<?php\r\n\r\ninterface Assertions {\r\n    /**\r\n     * @psalm-pure\r\n

function allIsInstanceOf($value, $class): void;\r\n}\r\n\r\n/** @mixin Assertions */\r\nclass Assert {}\r\n\r\nclass MyObject\r\n{\r\n    public string $productType = 'foo';\r\n}\r\n\r\n/** \r\n *

assert(\\array_key_exists(0, $value));\r\n    \r\n    return $value[0]->productType;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nhttps://psalm.dev/r/ece65ca3ab\r\n\r\nThis reports:\r\n\r\n```\r\nERROR: UnusedMethodCall - 37:13 - The call to Assertions::isList is not used\r\n\r\nERROR: UnusedMethodCall - 38:13 - The call to Assertions::allIsInstanceOf is not used\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote that the types are correctly inferred based on `@psalm-assert`, so that bit is definitely working!\r\n\r\nIt seems like some information about `@psalm-assert` + `@psalm-pure` (#2456) is lost when using `@mixin`.\r\n\r\nFor example, if I move the assertions from the `@mixin Assertions` to the concrete `Assert` class, the `UnusedMethodCall` issues disappear:\r\n\r\n```php\r\n<?php\r\n\r\nclass Assert {\r\n    /**\r\n     * @psalm-pure\r\n     * @psalm-assert list $array\r\n     *\r\n     * @param mixed  $array\r\n     */\r\n    static function isList($array): void {}\r\n\r\n    /**\r\n     * @psalm-pure\r\n     * @psalm-template ExpectedType of object\r\n     * @psalm-param class-string<ExpectedType> $class\r\n     * @psalm-assert iterable<ExpectedType> $value\r\n     *\r\n     * @param mixed $value\r\n     */\r\n    static function allIsInstanceOf($value, $class): void {}\r\n}\r\n\r\nclass MyObject\r\n{\r\n    public string $productType = 'foo';\r\n}\r\n\r\n/** \r\n * @param mixed $value\r\n * @return string\r\n */\r\nfunction convertToDatabaseValue($value): string\r\n{\r\n    Assert::isList($value);\r\n    Assert::allIsInstanceOf($value, MyObject::class);\r\n    assert(\\array_key_exists(0, $value));\r\n    \r\n    return $value[0]->productType;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nhttps://psalm.dev/r/387bf7c3cf\r\n\r\nAlso here, I verified that the assertions are 100% working.\r\n\r\nPotentially related to #3922, but with a more precise analysis (`@mixin` involved, like #3701)\r\n\r\nThis was previously fixed for #2456 in https://github.com/vimeo/psalm/commit/4b715cdbffea19a7eab6f72482027d2dd358aab2, but the information about `@mixin` is somehow lost somewhere :)
