`generate.php` in this PR is really a quick and dirty implementation of a generator and it should not be looked too closely: the final implementation would be re-done almost entirely (though the idea would be kept).\r\n\r\nWhat I want to suggest you for discussion is the `Webmozart\\Assert\\Extra` class.\r\n\r\nIn the final implementation I suggest to rename the currently existing `Webmozart\\Assert\\Assert` to `Webmozart\\Assert\\Base`, and then `Webmozart\\Assert\\Extra` to `Webmozart\\Assert\\Assert` so that it was all transparent for the users.\r\n\r\nThe final implementation would come with a test that checks that the currently generated version and committed version is identical to the one that would have been generated now should you run `php generate.php`.\r\n\r\nThe current implementation generates 47 functions out of the list of all `allX` or `nullOrX` functions, and 9 are not supported probably due to possible psalm bugs (need investigation). You can see list of those in the `$temporaryUnsupported` variable.\r\n\r\nThoughts?\r\n\r\n/cc @Ocramius","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/webmozarts/assert/issues/126/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/webmozarts/assert/issues/126/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":3247845866,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MzI0Nzg0NTg2Ng==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vimeo/psalm/issues/events/3247845866","actor":{"login":"muglug","id":2292638,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyOTI2Mzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2292638?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug","html_url":"https://github.com/muglug","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":"61f5a06a7b274c02bfeb495049469270ed4cc975","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vimeo/psalm/commits/61f5a06a7b274c02bfeb495049469270ed4cc975","created_at":"2020-04-18T15:57:31Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3247846424,"node_id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDMyNDc4NDY0MjQ=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vimeo/psalm/issues/events/3247846424","actor":{"login":"muglug","id":2292638,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyOTI2Mzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2292638?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug","html_url":"https://github.com/muglug","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-04-18T15:57:42Z","label":{"name":"bug","color":"ee0701"},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
