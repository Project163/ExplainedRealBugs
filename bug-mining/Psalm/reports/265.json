I basically have a Collection class with a single generic variable `T` and the collection accepts only generic bindings of a given interface.   Psalm is yielding two errors that I think are invalid.\r\n\r\nHere's the example\r\nhttps://psalm.dev/r/44fc9e203a\r\n\r\nHere's the errors\r\n>Psalm output (using commit d85fbae): \r\n>\r\n>ERROR: InvalidPropertyAssignmentValue - 63:31 - $this->related_model with declared type 'T as ModelInterface' cannot be assigned type 'TestEntity'\r\n>\r\n>ERROR: InvalidPropertyAssignmentValue - 34:13 - $this->items with declared type 'array<string, T as ModelInterface>' cannot be assigned type 'non-empty-array<string, T as ModelInterface|TestEntity>'\r\n\r\nIn this example, `TestEntity` does implement `ModelInterface`, so the errors (in my opinion) are invalid.\r\n\r\nBy the way, Psalm is awesome.  My background is in Java and having generics at least for Collection classes is a must-have.  So thanks for creating this life-saving awesome tool for PHP.","closed_by":{"login":"muglug","id":2292638,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyOTI2Mzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2292638?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug","html_url":"https://github.com/muglug","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vimeo/psalm/issues/2208/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vimeo/psalm/issues/2208/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
