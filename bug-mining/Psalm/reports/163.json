I thought it would be hard to make that easier because I thought that the hostname was randomly generated and unpredictable for each build.\r\n\r\nBut I just [learned](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/46880788/circle-ci-2-0-artifacts-url) that it's not random - 1209 is a job number, which is available as an environment variable inside Circle, and 74386167 is the Github ID number for this repo, which is not in an environment variable, but is available at https://api.github.com/repos/vimeo/psalm and could be cached in Circle.\r\n\r\nSo at a minimum I'd like to output those URIs to the console in CircleCI. Potentially a bot could add them as comments on the PR and/or commit that the build was based on.","closed_by":{"login":"muglug","id":2292638,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyOTI2Mzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2292638?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug","html_url":"https://github.com/muglug","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vimeo/psalm/issues/1919/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vimeo/psalm/issues/1919/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
