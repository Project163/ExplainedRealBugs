For fast IDE lookup the most important information to locate the error is file name and line number.\r\n\r\nAlso since the length of output varies, this is in different place on screen from error to error, requiring to visually scan monochrome message for it every time.\r\n\r\nCan I suggest this part of output is made colored? Probably not red, but blue or something.\r\n\r\nThank you for considering. :)","closed_by":{"login":"weirdan","id":57403,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3NDAz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/57403?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/weirdan","html_url":"https://github.com/weirdan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weirdan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weirdan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weirdan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weirdan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weirdan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weirdan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weirdan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weirdan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weirdan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vimeo/psalm/issues/4129/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vimeo/psalm/issues/4129/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
