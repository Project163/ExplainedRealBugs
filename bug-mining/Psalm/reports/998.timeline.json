But I can reproduce it in doctrine-psalm-plugin repo:\r\n\r\n```console\r\ngit clone git@github.com:weirdan/doctrine-psalm-plugin.git\r\ncd doctrine-psalm-plugin\r\ngit checkout allow-psalm-4\r\ncomposer install\r\nvendor/bin/codecept run acceptance tests/acceptance/EntityManager.feature:'Getting a reference'\r\n```\r\nAfter it runs (and fails) there will be `tests/_run` folder left behind, which contains a PHP file and `psalm.xml` file - running `../../vendor/bin/psalm` inside that folder will reproduce the issue. Note that you would need to run Psalm from the vendor folder - otherwise the plugin wouldn't load.\r\n\r\nSorry if that looks overly complicated, but that's the only way I'm able to reproduce the issue.","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vimeo/psalm/issues/comments/735559191/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"weirdan","id":57403,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3NDAz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/57403?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/weirdan","html_url":"https://github.com/weirdan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weirdan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weirdan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weirdan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weirdan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weirdan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weirdan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weirdan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weirdan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weirdan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vimeo/psalm/issues/comments/735794611","html_url":"https://github.com/vimeo/psalm/issues/4705#issuecomment-735794611","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vimeo/psalm/issues/4705","id":735794611,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDczNTc5NDYxMQ==","user":{"login":"muglug","id":2292638,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyOTI2Mzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2292638?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug","html_url":"https://github.com/muglug","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-11-30T13:44:50Z","updated_at":"2020-11-30T13:44:50Z","body":"Have
