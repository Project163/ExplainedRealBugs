I mean, not declaring a property type with `@var ...` when a property is directly assigned in the constructor from a PHP-typed parameter.\r\n\r\nFor example, Symfony [do the same](https://github.com/symfony/symfony/blob/4.4/src/Symfony/Component/Mime/Message.php#L24-L33) since some time with _recent_ code. Also PhpStorm is dealing great with this:\r\n![Sélection_772](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2103975/58556231-c7d71400-821b-11e9-9498-d9ae3ce44a40.png)\r\n\r\nConsidering [this example](https://psalm.dev/r/dabf4c2e64), when we have `Property Foo::$a does not have a declared type - consider XXX`, it would be nice for Psalm to infer `$a` type with `XXX` instead of giving a warning, no?\r\nThat would also prevent the error `Cannot determine the type of the object on the left hand side of this expression`, because for Psalm `$a` has no type.\r\n\r\nHere is [the example with `@var`](https://psalm.dev/r/17fc6ab988), this is the behavior I expected before runing Psalm (but without the explicit `@var`).\r\n\r\nWhat do you think about it?\r\nThanks! :)","closed_by":{"login":"muglug","id":2292638,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyOTI2Mzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2292638?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug","html_url":"https://github.com/muglug","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vimeo/psalm/issues/1703/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vimeo/psalm/issues/1703/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
