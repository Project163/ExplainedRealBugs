Is there any way to find out why Psalm raises a certain issue and what Psalm thinks the relevant types look like at that point? I'd try setting some breakpoints, but with xdebug disabled by Psalm, that wouldn't work. I've also tried --debug and --debug-by-line but couldn't find any useful information.\r\n\r\nIn this case, the problem is some chained method calls raising PossiblyInvalidMethodCall/MixedMethodCall issues because Psalm assumes some weird (imo wrong) types. I've created a minimal reproduction [here](https://github.com/AegirLeet/psalm-issue). I just can't figure out where those types are coming from, since everything looks fine in PhpStorm.\r\n\r\nIs there a recommended way to debug such cases?","closed_by":{"login":"muglug","id":2292638,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyOTI2Mzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2292638?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug","html_url":"https://github.com/muglug","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vimeo/psalm/issues/2881/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vimeo/psalm/issues/2881/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
