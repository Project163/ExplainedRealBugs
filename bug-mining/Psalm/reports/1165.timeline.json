Not sure what you mean, don't hesitate to push what you have if you're stuck and we'll help from there\r\n\r\nthe rest of the UnusedTest tests rely on `throw_exceptions` to either blow up on the first issue or not at all.\r\n\r\nBut in order to make a test for this, there's always at least one issue (the unevaluated code one).\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, if you disable `throw_exception` on the config with otherwise identical code to the existing tests, no issues will be recorded in the `IssueBuffer` because the `$file_path` defined by the other tests is outside of the test project directory.\r\n\r\nBut no worries. I found a solution and fixed the path for new tests.\r\n\r\nYour intuition was right - all all that was needed was returning `null` instead of
