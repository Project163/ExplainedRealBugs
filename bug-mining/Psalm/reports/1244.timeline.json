is something I've been working on for the past year with my fellow coworkers @bsandstrom @berrugo @GameGamer43 and @xrobau in v4 but just brought it to v5. Keeping it as a draft here against v5 while I work through tests and other issues though it currently works as is\r\n\r\n*Status*: Updated to https://github.com/vimeo/psalm/releases/tag/5.7.7\r\n\r\n### TODO:\r\n- [X] Fixed errored test case\r\n- [X] Add back internal functions that were removed \r\n- [X] Fix dynamic configuration changes\r\n\r\n### Fixed:\r\n* #4139 \r\n* #9180\r\n\r\n### Added:\r\n* `ClientConfiguration` class to store client configuration for the LSP\r\n* Dynamically request configuration from client. \r\n  * This means that clients can now set updates and not have to restart Psalm\r\n* `PHPMarkdownContent` class that extends `LanguageServerProtocol\\MarkupContent`.\r\n  * This helps to standardize how hovers look in clients across the usage in Psalm\r\n* Provide hover analysis results for any context in php\r\n  * This actually ends up providing decent generic support (At least in my usage)\r\n* Provide more granular control over what the LSP does:\r\n  * `--enable-code-actions` Enables or disables code actions. Default is true.\r\n  * `--enable-provide-diagnostics` Enables or disables providing diagnostics. Default is true.\r\n  * `--enable-provide-hover` Enables or disables providing hover. Default is true.\r\n  * `--enable-provide-signature-help` Enables or disables providing signature help. Default is true.\r\n  * `--enable-provide-definition` Enables or disables providing definition. Default is true.\r\n  * `--show-diagnostic-warnings` Enables or disables showing diagnostic warnings. Default is true. (continuation of #7379)\r\n* Added `--on-change-debounce-ms` which helps to control CPU when working with large codebases . Default is 500ms\r\n* Created `Reference` class to pass file reference information around instead of passing arrays (which are hard to type)\r\n* `AsyncTestCase` base Test for testing anything in the LSP, this extends `Amp\\PHPUnit\\AsyncTestCase` and is now being used in a few of the test cases\r\n* Added `--use-baseline=` to use a baseline file that was generated from Psalm CLI. This will turn any errors into warnings. The warnings can then be hidden with `--show-diagnostic-warnings=false`\r\n\r\n### Changed:\n* Clear file cache for server on boot\r\n* Created a `Progress` helper class that extends `Psalm\\Progress\\Progress` to help forward Psalm messages back to the LSP. This means Psalm's LSP is much more verbose than before\r\n* Temp file array now contains the version of the file that was changed/opened as per the LSP spec, this value is then sent back to the client so that it knows when to ignore old updates.\r\n* Because of the addition of `--on-change-debounce-ms` updates to the client are not always instant (comparatively to v4 which was 0ms) (default value for this is 500ms which is 1/2 second). This can be changed but it should be noted (I do not see a big difference in large code bases myself but it helps to prevent Psalm from backing up with change events and has actually helped the overall dev experience in my IDE)\r\n* No longer run `doAnalysis` when event `readMessageGroup` is received. The reasoning for this is because when #7255 was done it caused a huge influx of `readMessageGroup` events\r\n\r\n### Testing:\r\ncomposer.json:\r\n```\r\n    \"require-dev\": {\r\n        \"vimeo/psalm\": \"dev-feature/upgrade-lsp-v5 as 5.7.7\"\r\n    },\r\n    \"repositories\": [\r\n        {\r\n            \"type\": \"vcs\",\r\n            \"url\": \"https://github.com/tm1000/psalm\"\r\n        }\r\n    ]\r\n```\r\n\r\nvscode settings:\r\n```\r\n    \"psalm.psalmVersion\": \"5.7.7\",\r\n    \"psalm.psalmScriptArgs\": [\r\n        \"--on-change-debounce-ms=500\",\r\n        \"--show-diagnostic-warnings=false\"\r\n    ],\r\n    \"psalm.psalmScriptPath\": \"app/vendor/bin/psalm-language-server\",\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote that `psalmScriptPath` is specific to my setup. The point is you want to use `psalm-language-server` not `psalm` (even though psalm does a pass-thru to `psalm-language-server`) \r\n\r\n### Meta\r\n\r\nFixes vimeo/psalm#4139\r\nFixes
