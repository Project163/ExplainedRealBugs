I don't think of any other way other than creating a new ReturnTypeProvider for this.\r\n\r\nThe complexity here is that the return type depends on the result of another method rather than the parameters of the method.\r\n\r\nI looked in Psalm and in Psalm's plugin and it doesn't appear to have already been done anywhere.\r\n\r\nHowever, I think we could exploit method memoization setting (MethodCallAnalyzer line 204) that store the result of previous methods in the context.\r\n\r\nBy retrieving $event->getContext()->vars_in_scope in the ReturnTypeProvider, you should be able to know the type returned by hasType when calling getType.\r\n\r\nAs I said, I don't think it has ever been done and it's exploiting a not totally relevant setting and feature to work. I would have no remorse doing that in one of my plugins, but I'm not sure it's good enough to be added in core.\r\n\r\nMaybe instead of using memoization setting, Psalm could have a list of methods
