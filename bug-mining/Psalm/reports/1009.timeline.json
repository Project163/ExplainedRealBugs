This means that, in this case, the `FunctionLikeStorage` class passed in is not for the correct function.\r\n\r\nWorking backwards from this, the method call gets it's `$function_storage` from a call to `$codebase_functions->getStorage()`\r\nhttps://github.com/vimeo/psalm/blob/ea9cb72143b77e7520c52fa37290bd8d8bc88fd9/src/Psalm/Internal/Analyzer/Statements/Expression/Call/FunctionCallAnalyzer.php#L250\r\n\r\nNB: Interestingly, in the master branch, this line has slightly changed since the version 4.2.1 that I'm using.\r\n\r\nI worked out that `getStorage()` is returning a `FunctionLikeStorage` early from the `self::$stubbed_functions`\r\nhttps://github.com/vimeo/psalm/blob/ea9cb72143b77e7520c52fa37290bd8d8bc88fd9/src/Psalm/Internal/Codebase/Functions.php#L76\r\n\r\nEventually, this led me to `addGlobalFunction`.
