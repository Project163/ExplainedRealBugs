It looks like Psalm only cares about semver major and minor versions, but the way it detects it is by finding the lowest MAJOR.MINOR version that satisfies the composer required version. Since this project requires 7.2.5, 7.2 does not satisfy that, but 7.3 does, so it returns 7.3. I would expect it to detect 7.2.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/vimeo/psalm/blob/3046468d1e151a22a19d4c8cb2988ce3cf2633c4/src/Psalm/Config.php#L2056-L2060","closed_by":{"login":"muglug","id":2292638,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyOTI2Mzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2292638?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug","html_url":"https://github.com/muglug","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vimeo/psalm/issues/5415/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vimeo/psalm/issues/5415/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
