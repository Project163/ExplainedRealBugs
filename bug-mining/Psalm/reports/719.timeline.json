don't exactly have suppressed issues, but the Plugin class itself is being ignored because Psalm was considering it to be a DuplicateClass. I think this is because the plugin file is in the same code base being analyzed by Psalm, they are not separate projects. I tried taking that ignore out of my psalm.xml just now. Even though the DuplicateClass issue is reported, psalm continues running (which is expected), and at the end, the $issues array has both the DuplicateClass issue, and that other empty issue for Button.php. So it seems there may be something about Button.php that is triggering this.\r\n\r\nI also went back to this being a file based plugin because I need to load the plugin through the command line options, not my psalm.xml. This is because my plugin has an unusual purpose. Even when using this plugin, you don't normally want it to run it with Psalm, so it has to be explicitly requested through the command line --plugin option. As far as I can see, there is not a separate command line option for class based plugins. I tried passing the class to --plugin, but it requires a path.\r\n\r\nMy plugin is supposed to record information provided by Psalm during analysis, and then at the end of the analysis, if there are no Psalm issues, it would use that information to generate test data, and feed it into immutable class methods/functions, to see if any contract exceptions get thrown (preconditions, postconditions, invariants, etc) that always run in the code, or if there are any errors.\r\n\r\nCommand line usage: `vendor/bin/psalm --no-cache --plugin=src/StaticTestingPlugin/Isolated/Plugin.php`\r\n\r\npsalm.xml (with the directory containing the plugin excluded):\r\n```\r\n<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\r\n<psalm\r\n    errorLevel=\"1\"\r\n    resolveFromConfigFile=\"true\"\r\n    xmlns:xsi=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\"\r\n    xmlns=\"https://getpsalm.org/schema/config\"\r\n    xsi:schemaLocation=\"https://getpsalm.org/schema/config vendor/vimeo/psalm/config.xsd\"\r\n    requireVoidReturnType=\"false\"\r\n    cacheDirectory=\"./psalmCache\"\r\n>\r\n    <projectFiles>\r\n        <directory name=\"src\" />\r\n        <ignoreFiles>\r\n            <directory name=\"vendor\" />\r\n            <directory name=\"src/StaticTestingPlugin/Isolated\" />\r\n        </ignoreFiles>\r\n    </projectFiles>\r\n</psalm>\r\n```\r\n\r\nI just realized I should try to come up with a better reproduce by reducing the contents of Button.php.
