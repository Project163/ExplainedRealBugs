On some exotic system there might be a `glob` implementation in libc that does return an empty string as a pathname.\r\nIf there might be the slightest chance of having a system which considers an empty pathname as valid (maybe even as a special pathname idk) meaning that `glob('')` and `glob('*')` could return an array containing an empty string, we should use this stub: https://psalm.dev/r/ce62bf2569 and this callmap:\r\n```\r\n'glob' => ['false|list<string>', 'pattern'=>'string', 'flags='=>'int-mask<GLOB_MARK, GLOB_NOSORT, GLOB_NOCHECK, GLOB_NOESCAPE, GLOB_BRACE, GLOB_ONLYDIR, GLOB_ERR>']\r\n```\r\n\r\nUntil we all agree on a better type, I would kindly ask @orklah to revert the PR #9752 (and the improvement PR #9814 which did fixes some issues with the newly introduced typing but not all).\r\n\r\n@kkmuffme mind creating a PR with the stub typing suggested (given you agree with that typing). Best would bea PR with the second version of the stub, because that is less strict and IMO better less strict than wrong.\r\n\r\nWe could vote in that PR for which version to choose, either accepting there might be empty-strings or assuming that will never

\r\n>Is that a definition everyone agrees on?\r\n\r\n`0?:string,` is a pain for me :-( \r\nI think a custom return type provider (like for dirname) would be better and then in that provider use your suggestion in the callmap/as fallback, if the first arg is of type \"string\" (or empty string literal). Bc then it would would work fine for all \"non-empty-string\" cases and all \"string\" cases, which would make everyone happy I guess.\r\n\r\n>If there might be the slightest chance of having a system which considers an empty pathname as valid\r\n\r\nThere can't be, bc if you check php-src, it will immediately return if the pattern is empty.
