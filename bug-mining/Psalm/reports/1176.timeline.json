like to discuss  psalm's concept of functions' purity. The [article](https://psalm.dev/articles/immutability-and-beyond) introducing \"@psalm-pure\" refers to [wikipedia's definition of pure function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pure_function), which states:\r\n\r\n> A pure function is a function that has the following properties:[1][2]\r\n>  1. the function return values are identical for identical arguments (...), and\r\n>  2. the function application has no side effects (...).\r\n\r\nThen an [ImpureVariable error example](https://psalm.dev/docs/running_psalm/issues/ImpureVariable/) appears, which demonstrates how psalm names a pure function impure.\r\n\r\nI can't understand why ``$this`` is so exceptional in this context? Shouldn't it be treated as a regular parameter to an instance method? I think it should, and I'm not alone here, for example: https://stackoverflow.com/a/50466413/2186051. In my opinion, the difference between regular parameter ``$obj`` and ``$this`` in ``foo(self $obj)`` is just the notation. It doesn't differ much semantically, though. Here are some facts:\r\n\r\n- ``$this`` is not a global variable from method's perspective, it's not either static variable/property; if it was, then the following code should not work as it currently works:\r\n```php\r\n<?php declare(strict_types=1);\r\nfinal class C {\r\n  public function f(): void\r\n  {\r\n    $s = new self();\r\n    $s->g();\r\n    // if $this was global/static then we had $this === $s at this point,\r\n    // but we have $this === $c, so magically $this appears on call stack?\r\n  }\r\n  public function g(): void\r\n  {\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n$c = new C();\r\n$c->f();\r\n```\r\n- ``$this`` is not instantiated (randomly) inside a method, it's always provided by caller.\r\n\r\nSo, ``$this`` has all the symptoms of function's parameter, except the notation (it's not passed via argument list within parentheses and does not appear explicitly on parameter list in method's signature). But this is only how we write code, the program still works as if ``$this`` was a regular parameter.\r\n\r\nThere are some restrictions regarding ``$this`` that don't apply to regular parameters/variables:\r\n\r\n- ``$this`` can't be (re)assigned,\r\n- ``$this`` can't be used as a name for explicit parameter in function signature,\r\n- ``$this`` is obligatory for instance method,\r\n- for an instance method from class ``C``, the type of ``$this`` parameter is ``C`` (or a subclass of C), we can't change it,\r\n\r\nbut this doesn't matter when discussing methods' purity.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe concept of \"instance variable\" is similar across many languages. Python makes things more explicit - each instance method declares explicitly a parameter called ``self`` on its parameter list. The notation for calling instance method remains same - ``obj.method()``:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nclass C:  \r\n    def foo(self):  \r\n        return self\r\n\r\nc = C()\r\nc.foo()\r\n```\r\nI think ``$this`` should be handled by psalm as a regular parameter, and documentation should state this. The purity analysis in psalm handles quite well object references provided via parameters list and, perhaps, the same code could be used directly for ``$this``. This could reduce code size and cut the unnecessary discussions of how ``$this`` is different from the same instance but provided via parameter declared within parentheses.\r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vimeo/psalm/issues/7438/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vimeo/psalm/issues/7438/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
