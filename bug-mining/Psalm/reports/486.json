I won't attempt to port these to Psalm since I'm not using it at the moment, but your users might benefit from these improvements too.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/phpstan/phpstan-src/blob/master/stubs/ext-ds.stub\r\n\r\nNote that PHPStan's stubs don't contain all methods that actually exist on these classes but only those that are using `@template` types. So methods like `count()`, `isEmpty()` etc. are missing in these stubs - not sure if Psalm needs them to be there or not.\r\n\r\nAlso note that part of the `ext-ds` support is [this](https://github.com/phpstan/phpstan-src/blob/master/src/Type/Php/DsMapDynamicReturnTypeExtension.php) DynamicMethodReturnTypeExtension which lets PHPStan correctly interpret the different behavior of `\\Ds\\Map::get()` based on the number of given arguments. Currently Psalm doesn't interpret this correctly, I tried.","closed_by":{"login":"muglug","id":2292638,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyOTI2Mzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2292638?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug","html_url":"https://github.com/muglug","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vimeo/psalm/issues/2754/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vimeo/psalm/issues/2754/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
