I don't see that call in the parent class [`Router`](https://github.com/laravel/framework/blob/9425a2f410d05d5bba493f62cff03854a8b19559/src/Illuminate/Routing/Router.php).\r\n\r\nCould it be that it's caused by the following [`Macroable`](https://github.com/laravel/framework/blob/9425a2f410d05d5bba493f62cff03854a8b19559/src/Illuminate/Support/Traits/Macroable.php) trait usage:\r\n\r\n![grafik](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/495429/76970971-e3d3af80-692c-11ea-97d3-bc4907de3732.png)\r\n([Source](https://github.com/laravel/framework/blob/9425a2f410d05d5bba493f62cff03854a8b19559/src/Illuminate/Routing/Router.php#L30-L34))\r\n\r\n```console\r\n$ composer global require laravel/installer\r\n$ laravel new blog\r\n$ cd blog\r\n$ composer require --dev vimeo/psalm\r\n$ vendor/bin/psalm --init\r\nCalculating best config level based on project files\r\nScanning files...\r\nAnalyzing files...\r\n\r\nE░░░░░░E░E░░░E░EE\r\n\r\nDetected level 3 as a suitable initial default\r\nConfig file created successfully.
