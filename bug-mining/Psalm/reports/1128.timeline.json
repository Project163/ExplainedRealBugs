The only reference to it that I could find is in https://github.com/vimeo/psalm/blob/1a59e8180878cd7a1758e30c1558cd27e42f7478/dictionaries/CallMap.php, but no purity markers are there.\r\n>\r\n> I'd gladly fix these, if I could get a pointer to where purity is determined.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vimeo/psalm/issues/5762/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vimeo/psalm/issues/5762/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":4744607528,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50NDc0NDYwNzUyOA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vimeo/psalm/issues/events/4744607528","actor":{"login":"muglug","id":2292638,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyOTI2Mzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2292638?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug","html_url":"https://github.com/muglug","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-05-14T01:18:00Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":4744607568,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDQ3NDQ2MDc1Njg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vimeo/psalm/issues/events/4744607568","actor":{"login":"muglug","id":2292638,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyOTI2Mzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2292638?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug","html_url":"https://github.com/muglug","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"641587635d1fabd5539c23385ced18e9840cce45","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vimeo/psalm/commits/641587635d1fabd5539c23385ced18e9840cce45","created_at":"2021-05-14T01:18:01Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
