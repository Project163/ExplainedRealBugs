So where a type parameter is constrained to be `T of Base` we can assume `T::factory()` returns `T`. Thus `C::f()` should not be flagged with `InvalidReturnStatement`.\r\n\r\nhttps://psalm.dev/r/1a056c3be2\r\n```php\r\n<?php\r\nclass Base {\r\n  /** @return static */\r\n  public static function factory(): self {\r\n    return new self();\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\n/** \r\n * @template T of Base\r\n * @param class-string<T> $t\r\n * @return T \r\n */\r\nfunction f(string $t) {\r\n  return $t::factory(); // in functions it's fine\r\n}\r\n\r\n/** @template T of Base */\r\nclass C {\r\n  /** @var class-string<T> */\r\n  private string $t;\r\n\r\n  /** @param class-string<T> $t */\r\n  public function __construct($t) { $this->t = $t; }\r\n  \r\n  /** @return T */\r\n  public function f(): Base {\r\n    return ($this->t)::factory(); // and it should be allowed in methods just like it is for the function above\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n**Expected**: no issues\r\n**Actual**:\r\n```\r\nPsalm output (using commit 2b6831b):\r\n\r\nERROR: InvalidReturnStatement - 27:12 - The type 'T as Base' does not match the declared return type 'T:C as Base' for C::f\r\n\r\nERROR: InvalidReturnType - 25:15 - The declared return type 'T' for C::f is incorrect, got 'T'\r\n```","closed_by":{"login":"muglug","id":2292638,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyOTI2Mzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2292638?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug","html_url":"https://github.com/muglug","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vimeo/psalm/issues/2439/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vimeo/psalm/issues/2439/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
