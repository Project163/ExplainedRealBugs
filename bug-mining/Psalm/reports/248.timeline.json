Can you elaborate on a scenario where two interfaces are involved, and mutability would be an advantage? I'd expect any state touched by `SomethingImmutable` implementations (even if just the methods) to require immutability/read-only.","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vimeo/psalm/issues/comments/531482870/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"Ocramius","id":154256,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1NDI1Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/154256?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ocramius","html_url":"https://github.com/Ocramius","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ocramius/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ocramius/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ocramius/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ocramius/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ocramius/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ocramius/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ocramius/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ocramius/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ocramius/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":2634155494,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MjYzNDE1NTQ5NA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vimeo/psalm/issues/events/2634155494","actor":{"login":"weirdan","id":57403,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3NDAz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/57403?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/weirdan","html_url":"https://github.com/weirdan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weirdan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weirdan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weirdan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weirdan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weirdan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weirdan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weirdan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weirdan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weirdan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-09-14T14:13:27Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2634155497,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDI2MzQxNTU0OTc=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vimeo/psalm/issues/events/2634155497","actor":{"login":"weirdan","id":57403,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3NDAz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/57403?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/weirdan","html_url":"https://github.com/weirdan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weirdan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weirdan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weirdan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weirdan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weirdan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weirdan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weirdan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weirdan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weirdan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-09-14T14:13:27Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vimeo/psalm/issues/comments/531484098","html_url":"https://github.com/vimeo/psalm/issues/2138#issuecomment-531484098","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vimeo/psalm/issues/2138","id":531484098,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUzMTQ4NDA5OA==","user":{"login":"weirdan","id":57403,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3NDAz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/57403?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/weirdan","html_url":"https://github.com/weirdan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weirdan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weirdan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weirdan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weirdan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weirdan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weirdan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weirdan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weirdan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weirdan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-09-14T14:29:39Z","updated_at":"2019-09-14T14:29:39Z","body":"I

Passing around something expected to be immutable (while it is not) is seriously problematic\r\n\r\nWhy do you think so? I assume it's because something outside of `MyBankAccount` could mutate the `MyMoney` instance?\r\n\r\n```php\r\n$myMoney = new MyMoney();\r\n$myBankAccount = new MyBankAccount($myMoney);\r\n$myMoney->increment(); // $myBankAccount has implicitely changed\r\n```\r\n\r\nThat's a valid point. This is a hard issue to solve with reference types. Swift for example only tracks mutability for structs which are value types. Although `@immutable` doesn't mean pure so Psalm shouldn't assume that `gimme()` always returns the same value either way.","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vimeo/psalm/issues/comments/533914535/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"iluuu1994","id":1752683,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NTI2ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1752683?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/iluuu1994","html_url":"https://github.com/iluuu1994","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iluuu1994/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iluuu1994/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iluuu1994/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iluuu1994/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iluuu1994/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iluuu1994/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iluuu1994/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iluuu1994/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iluuu1994/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vimeo/psalm/issues/comments/533916693","html_url":"https://github.com/vimeo/psalm/issues/2138#issuecomment-533916693","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vimeo/psalm/issues/2138","id":533916693,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUzMzkxNjY5Mw==","user":{"login":"Ocramius","id":154256,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1NDI1Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/154256?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ocramius","html_url":"https://github.com/Ocramius","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ocramius/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ocramius/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ocramius/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ocramius/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ocramius/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ocramius/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ocramius/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ocramius/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ocramius/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-09-22T20:40:05Z","updated_at":"2019-09-22T20:40:05Z","body":"@muglug the idea of immutability on objects is to avoid any by-ref mutation of state: having mutators on anything that is expected to be immutable is pretty much defeating the use of this annotation on supertypes.\r\n\r\n@iluuu1994 yes, spooky action at a distance is very common, and effectively to be avoided.\r\n\r\nI think folks in the thread are confusing immutability with API purity: the API declared on an interface may well be pure, but immutability is something that affects all state of an instance.\r\n\r\nIn practice, `@immutable` should be enforced on all API and state even on an
