Looking at https://github.com/vimeo/psalm/blob/master/src/Psalm/Internal/LanguageServer/Server/TextDocument.php I can see the code exists to allow openClose and save\r\n\r\nHowever only `change` is declared as an ability (https://github.com/vimeo/psalm/blob/master/src/Psalm/Internal/LanguageServer/LanguageServer.php#L231). This seems to have been the case from the first day this was added?\r\n\r\nSince only change is supported static analysis is not run on an open file until a user changes something in that document (or alternatively hover is triggered).\r\n\r\nThis wouldn't be an issue because maybe you'd only want analysis to run if the file is modified but that breaks because it runs anyways whenever any text is hovered over so why not just enable openClose\r\n\r\nCan we enable the other methods? \r\n\r\n```\r\n        \"textDocumentSync\": {\r\n            \"openClose\": null,\r\n            \"change\": 1,\r\n            \"willSave\": null,\r\n            \"willSaveWaitUntil\": null,\r\n            \"save\": null\r\n        }\r\n```\r\n\r\nI will submit a PR for this in a moment","closed_by":{"login":"weirdan","id":57403,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3NDAz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/57403?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/weirdan","html_url":"https://github.com/weirdan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weirdan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weirdan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weirdan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weirdan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weirdan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weirdan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weirdan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weirdan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weirdan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vimeo/psalm/issues/6008/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vimeo/psalm/issues/6008/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
