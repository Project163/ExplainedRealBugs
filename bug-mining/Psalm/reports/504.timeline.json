PR provides a possible fix for #2804 by introducing an additional hook interface that is called regardless of how the called function is defined at the cost of the two by-ref parameters present in `AfterFunctionCallAnalysisInterface` which don't make sense for php internals.\r\n\r\nI might be a bit overly cautious with introducing an additional interface and the existing `AfterFunctionCallAnalysisInterface` could also be made to work with existing functions, but that would either mess with existing plugins that were written with the intention to provide file manipulations or tweak the inferred return type.\r\n\r\nI'll leave that for you to decide.\r\n\r\nthis fixes
