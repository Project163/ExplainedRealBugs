It seems to me that stub files should never get shallow _and_ deep scanned, as they only contain definitions, so function / method bodies etc are not present.\r\n\r\nFrom the best I can tell, the reason for deep scanning is due to a project having a class that extends the stubbed class as triggered by https://github.com/vimeo/psalm/blob/master/src/Psalm/Internal/Codebase/Scanner.php#L615. `$will_analyze` is `true` (analyzing the project file), and it (for some reason) forwards the `$will_analyze` to `queueClassLikeForScanning`. The subsequent lines for `required_interfaces` and `referenced_classlikes` hard code `$analyze_too` to `false`, so I'm wondering if this is an oversight?\r\n\r\nThis leads me to two questions I think:\r\n\r\n1. Why does requiring a class in file A cause a deep scan on File B that has the class? Isn't a shallow scan enough?\r\n\r\n1. Can stub-files always be short-circuited from deep scanning?","closed_by":{"login":"muglug","id":2292638,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyOTI2Mzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2292638?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug","html_url":"https://github.com/muglug","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vimeo/psalm/issues/3568/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vimeo/psalm/issues/3568/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
