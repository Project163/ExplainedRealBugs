If I use a return of plain `Element` then it doesn't complain. The return type is definitely nullable -- there is an explicit `return null` in one of the reachable branches. \r\n\r\nI've used psalm on-and-off and I can't remember how well it is expected to handle control flow. Is this supposed to work? Or maybe I have done something wrong?\r\n\r\nAs an aside, in version 3.14.1 I'm not getting the other INFOs, just the `LessSpecificReturnType`. Edit: this is probably because of the error level set.\r\n\r\nAlso, psalm is pretty great! While writing this snippet I originally used `$iterator` instead of `$iterator->current()` when passing to `$reduceWith` and the type checker caught the mistake.\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://psalm.dev/r/d727943d80","closed_by":{"login":"muglug","id":2292638,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyOTI2Mzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2292638?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug","html_url":"https://github.com/muglug","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vimeo/psalm/issues/4038/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vimeo/psalm/issues/4038/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
