Those could be property types, parameter types, return types, types used in inheritance (like T in `@extends Supertype<T>`) etc. Single-valued literal types could be useful for overloading in the callmap (#2293, #2022). Narrowing return types to a single value might be useful where parent/interface signature requires you to implement some method for which your implementation always returns a single value.\r\n\r\nIMO
