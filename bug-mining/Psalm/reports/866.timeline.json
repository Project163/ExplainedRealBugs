for the fix!\r\n\r\nThe suggestion for my example isn't quite right, I think, because the keys of a generic `iterable` can definitely be different from `array-key`. For instance, it is somewhat common for a `zip(['a' => 3, 'b' => 4], [1, 2])` to yield keys that look like `['a', 0]` and `['b', 1]`. In other words, they are arrays, which is not permitted for `array-key`.\r\n\r\nHowever, if a parameter `$p` is an `iterable<Key, Element>` and I do `is_array($p)` then the type of `Key` is `array-key` without any loss of information. I have no idea how to actually formulate this.
