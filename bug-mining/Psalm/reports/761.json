This leads to `UndefinedClass` errors, forcing me to suppress `UndefinedClass` for my whole project.\r\n\r\nMy project is an extension to MediaWiki. MediaWiki defines and autoloads the missing classes before invoking my project. I do not wish to analyze the whole of MediaWiki, which coincidentally leads to a crash https://github.com/vimeo/psalm/issues/3617. Ideally I can just tell Psalm to chill out about some specific missing classes. Or to look at the MediaWiki classes but not report on those (or crash).\r\n\r\nI had the same issue with PhpStan and fixes it by using the `scanDirectories` option:\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/146040/85094863-1f15a100-b1f0-11ea-95ed-b5a91f56de26.png)\r\n\r\nTwitter thread: https://twitter.com/psalmphp/status/1273817066664009728","closed_by":{"login":"muglug","id":2292638,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyOTI2Mzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2292638?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug","html_url":"https://github.com/muglug","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vimeo/psalm/issues/3618/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vimeo/psalm/issues/3618/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
