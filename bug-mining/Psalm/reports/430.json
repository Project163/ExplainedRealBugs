I wonder if the \"order of loading\" has something to do with this in autoloader? In my \"real\" code, I actually get an additional error:\r\n\r\n```\r\nERROR: MissingDependency - src/C.php:11:27 - ThirdPartyLibrary\\A depends on class or interface thirdpartylibrary\\b that does not exist\r\n    public function thing(A $a) : void {}\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor that full example, you can also see a test repo I made (since I can't seem to reproduce it in the psalm.dev editor): https://github.com/asgrim/psalm-shim-example","closed_by":{"login":"muglug","id":2292638,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyOTI2Mzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2292638?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug","html_url":"https://github.com/muglug","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vimeo/psalm/issues/2547/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vimeo/psalm/issues/2547/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
