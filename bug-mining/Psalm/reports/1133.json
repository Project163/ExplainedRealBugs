moving a derived class into another namespace, sometimes the first character of the moved class gets overwritten with the name of the base class.\r\n~~I think this only happens if the base class is in `vendor/` or otherwise excluded in Psalm configuration.~~ Edit: this is not true, please see my updated comment below.\r\nI have run into this issue when moving PHPUnit tests inheriting from `PHPUnit\\Framework\\TestCase`.\r\n\r\nHere's a minimal reproduction repo: https://github.com/pawel-slowik/psalm-move-bug-repro \r\n\r\n#### Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\n```\r\ncomposer install\r\n\r\nvendor/bin/psalm-refactor --move 'MyApp\\Hello' --into 'MyApp\\Foo'\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### The error\r\n\r\nThe opening `<?php` tag has been replaced with `Figlet?php`.\r\n\r\n```\r\ngit diff HEAD:src/MyApp/Hello.php src/MyApp/Foo/Hello.php\r\n```\r\n\r\n```diff\r\ndiff --git o/src/MyApp/Hello.php w/src/MyApp/Foo/Hello.php\r\nindex f6c831f..c1ad196 100644\r\n--- o/src/MyApp/Hello.php\r\n+++ w/src/MyApp/Foo/Hello.php\r\n@@ -1,6 +1,6 @@\r\n-<?php\r\n+Figlet?php\r\n\r\n-namespace MyApp;\r\n+namespace MyApp\\Foo;\r\n\r\nuse Laminas\\Text\\Figlet\\Figlet;\r\n```\r\n\r\nI have managed to track the issue up to here:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/vimeo/psalm/blob/1afce4d613b6d7f0856a54eb3441947759e96bae/src/Psalm/Internal/Codebase/ClassLikes.php#L1158-L1167\r\n\r\nwhere both `getAttribute` calls return nulls that get converted to integers. That's how we later end up with a `FileManipulation` having `start === 0` and `end === 1`, which overwrites the first character. But I have no idea how to fix it.\r\n\r\nI have verified that the issue is also present in the latest version / master branch (`composer require --dev vimeo/psalm:dev-master` and then redo the reproduce steps).","closed_by":{"login":"muglug","id":2292638,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyOTI2Mzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2292638?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug","html_url":"https://github.com/muglug","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vimeo/psalm/issues/5002/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vimeo/psalm/issues/5002/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
