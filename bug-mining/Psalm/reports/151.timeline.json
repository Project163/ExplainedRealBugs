To clarify: This issue is not really about covariance, it's about type inference.\r\n\r\nIn C# you'd instantiate `Foo` like so:\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\nFooBase = new Foo<Base>(() => new Derived());\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn PHP you don't have the option to specify the generic type in the expression which is why it would be great if the type would be inferred correctly. I don't know how this works in Psalm but a simple solution could be to pass the desired type to the type inferrer.\r\n\r\nIn all these statements:\r\n\r\n```php\r\n$this->property = new Foo(fn() => new Derived());\r\nfunc(new Foo(fn() => new Derived()));\r\nreturn new Foo(fn() => new Derived());\r\n```\r\n\r\nPsalm would pass the desired type (type of the property, parameter type, return type of the function, respectively) to the type inferrer. Psalm would check if the types are compatible and if they are the desired type is chosen.\r\n\r\nGood type inference is incredibly complex and I'm not experienced in it.
