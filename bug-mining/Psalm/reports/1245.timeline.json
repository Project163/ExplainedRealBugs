I will try to find something not complex to solve this (different PHP versions have different bundled/core php ext, it's also possible to compile PHP with/without some of them, it's possible to disable some ext in .ini, we can write a comprehensive solution for this, but I don't think we should increase complexity of the project on such non-major functionality).\r\n\r\n**UPD**: There is a PR for that: https://github.com/vimeo/psalm/pull/9099/files\n\n**UPD 2**: It's fixed and merged. The fix on master and will be shipped within next release (next after 5.4.0)","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vimeo/psalm/issues/comments/1378045418/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"alies-dev","id":5278175,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyNzgxNzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5278175?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alies-dev","html_url":"https://github.com/alies-dev","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alies-dev/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alies-dev/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alies-dev/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alies-dev/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alies-dev/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alies-dev/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alies-dev/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alies-dev/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alies-dev/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":8196828803,"node_id":"MEE_lADOBG8K985ZsGZQzwAAAAHoka6D","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vimeo/psalm/issues/events/8196828803","actor":{"login":"ThomasLandauer","id":1054469,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNTQ0Njk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1054469?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ThomasLandauer","html_url":"https://github.com/ThomasLandauer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ThomasLandauer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ThomasLandauer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ThomasLandauer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ThomasLandauer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ThomasLandauer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ThomasLandauer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ThomasLandauer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ThomasLandauer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ThomasLandauer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2023-01-10T23:48:46Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":8196828809,"node_id":"SE_lADOBG8K985ZsGZQzwAAAAHoka6J","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vimeo/psalm/issues/events/8196828809","actor":{"login":"ThomasLandauer","id":1054469,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNTQ0Njk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1054469?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ThomasLandauer","html_url":"https://github.com/ThomasLandauer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ThomasLandauer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ThomasLandauer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ThomasLandauer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ThomasLandauer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ThomasLandauer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ThomasLandauer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ThomasLandauer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ThomasLandauer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ThomasLandauer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2023-01-10T23:48:46Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"actor":{"login":"alies-dev","id":5278175,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyNzgxNzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5278175?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alies-dev","html_url":"https://github.com/alies-dev","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alies-dev/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alies-dev/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alies-dev/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alies-dev/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alies-dev/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alies-dev/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alies-dev/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alies-dev/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alies-dev/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-01-12T11:53:30Z","updated_at":"2023-01-12T11:53:30Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vimeo/psalm/issues/9099","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vimeo/psalm","labels_url":"https://api.github.c

But because public values of `\\Psalm\\Config::$php_extensions` are `false` by default, I can't say  - whether they falsy these ext disabled in xml config or this is just a default value. In order to fix it, I used a new default value - `null`, what is, in theory, a breaking change (`\\Psalm\\Config::$php_extensions`, Config class is not final). Also, I'm not sure that we should add more complexity just to hide deprecation message, so I'm open for new ideas how to solve it.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vimeo/psalm/issues/9291/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vimeo/psalm/issues/9291/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":8632333783,"node_id":"CE_lADOBG8K985ZsGZQzwAAAAIChvXX","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vimeo/psalm/issues/events/8632333783","actor":{"login":"orklah","id":9605520,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk2MDU1MjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9605520?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/orklah","html_url":"https://github.com/orklah","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/orklah/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/orklah/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/orklah/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/orklah/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/orklah/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/orklah/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/orklah/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/orklah/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/orklah/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2023-02-28T23:07:02Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
