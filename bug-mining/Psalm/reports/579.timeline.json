one other improvement that could be made (and I realise this is significant chunk of work, and me volunteering other people to do a lot of work is annoying), is showing what the fix would be in the example for each issue type.\r\n\r\nFor example, the current doc for the MixedAssignment error is:\r\n\r\n```\r\nMixedAssignment\r\nEmitted when assigning an unannotated variable to a value for which Psalm cannot infer a type more specific than mixed.\r\n\r\n$a = $_GET['foo'];\r\n```\r\nI'm a bit of a newb when it comes to Psalm. I'm sure it'll get easier for me to understand how to apply types to fix these errors, but right now my confidence in me being able to fix this error in less than five attempts is pretty low.\r\n\r\nIf as well as the code showing the example error, there was example code with the appropriate type info added, I think this would make it easier to go from an error to fixing the issue for psalm
