Wrapping it in a lambda should be enough.","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vimeo/psalm/issues/comments/682493836/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"olleharstedt","id":607341,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYwNzM0MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/607341?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/olleharstedt","html_url":"https://github.com/olleharstedt","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olleharstedt/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olleharstedt/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olleharstedt/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olleharstedt/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olleharstedt/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olleharstedt/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olleharstedt/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olleharstedt/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olleharstedt/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":3704580057,"node_id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDM3MDQ1ODAwNTc=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vimeo/psalm/issues/events/3704580057","actor":{"login":"muglug","id":2292638,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyOTI2Mzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2292638?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug","html_url":"https://github.com/muglug","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-08-28T16:01:44Z","label":{"name":"bug","color":"ee0701"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vimeo/psalm/issues/comments/682783638","html_url":"https://github.com/vimeo/psalm/issues/4077#issuecomment-682783638","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vimeo/psalm/issues/4077","id":682783638,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY4Mjc4MzYzOA==","user":{"login":"muglug","id":2292638,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyOTI2Mzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2292638?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug","html_url":"https://github.com/muglug","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-08-28T16:02:44Z","updated_at":"2020-08-28T16:02:44Z","body":"OK, you're right, I'm wrong.

back to the corner of @Ocramius' tricky issues!\r\n\r\nI'm currently designing a system to declare DB mutations in a pure way, and execute them (at runtime) in an impure way.

If a function is pure, the produced data structure is immutable, but not necessarily pure (`function (Machine $m) : void { $m->addBeans(); }` is an immutable `Closure`, but `Machine` is not immutable nor pure)\r\n * [ ] Immutability and purity are not necessarily overlapping: the `Closure` type is `immutable` if no `use ()` nor `global` nor `static` variables are present\r\n * [ ] Executing logic on the result (`object|callable`) of a `@psalm-pure` context is not to be considered pure (https://psalm.dev/r/a1852660f6):\r\n    ```php\r\n    /**\r\n     * @psalm-pure\r\n     * @psalm-return callable() : void\r\n     */\r\n    function makeSomeStuff() : callable\r\n    {\r\n        return static function () {\r\n            \\var_dump('this closure is not pure');\r\n        };\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    // expecting an error from this one - currently detects nothing\r\n    /** @psalm-pure */\r\n    function notReallyPure() : void\r\n        makeSomeStuff()();\r\n    }\r\n    ```\r\n * [ ] Later, we probably need a way to document parameter and return types as `@psalm-pure`, sort of like a meta-interface that needs to be part of the type (https://psalm.dev/r/a2d34a695d - parse error):\r\n    ```php\r\n    /**\r\n     * @psalm-pure\r\n     * @psalm-return @psalm-pure callable() : int\r\n     */\r\n    function makeSomeStuff() : callable\r\n    {\r\n        return static function () {\r\n            return 1;\r\n        };\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    // no error expected \r\n    /** @psalm-pure */\r\n    function notReallyPure() : int\r\n    {\r\n        return makeSomeStuff()();\r\n    }\r\n    ```","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vimeo/psalm/issues/2812/reactions","total_count":8,"+1":5,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":3,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vimeo/psalm/issues/2812/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":4265550855,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDQyNjU1NTA4NTU=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vimeo/psalm/issues/events/4265550855","actor":{"login":"danog","id":7339644,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjczMzk2NDQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7339644?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/danog","html_url":"https://github.com/danog","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danog/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danog/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danog/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danog/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danog/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danog/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danog/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danog/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danog/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"02255ae26b78eddbf05f3a3c859c2e2f18e955de","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/danog/psalm/commits/02255ae26b78eddbf05f3a3c859c2e2f18e955de","created_at":"2021-01-29T10:48:34Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vimeo/psalm/issues/comments/1371802497","html_url":"https://github.com/vimeo/psalm/issues/4077#issuecomment-1371802497","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vimeo/psalm/issues/4077","id":1371802497,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBG8K985RxAuB","user":{"login":"still-dreaming-1","id":354296,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1NDI5Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/354296?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/still-dreaming-1","html_url":"https://github.com/still-dreaming-1","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/still-dreaming-1/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/still-dreaming-1/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/still-dreaming-1/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/still-dreaming-1/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/still-dreaming-1/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/still-dreaming-1/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/still-dreaming-1/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/still-dreaming-1/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/still-dreaming-1/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-01-05T05:37:09Z","updated_at":"2023-01-05T05:37:51Z","body":"> Hooray! 🥳 Thanks! With this fix and wrapping side-effects in promises, it will be possible to do 100% pure business code. 😃\r\n\r\nActually that sounds like it might be what I have been looking for. What exactly do you mean by promises? I realize I'm commenting on a not super relevant comment within an already closed/fixed issue, but that might be exactly what I need. Can you point me to an example of clean code using Psalm to verify purity that does this?\r\n\r\nAny other way I can think of to allow impure code to hook into pure code in PHP would cause Psalm to say none of it is pure. In Kotlin you can make all your classes data classes and use events to make all your impure code bubble out to the fringes, out of your \"business code\" as you say. That is legit because pure code is not responsible for what event listeners do (I don't remember if events is exactly the right term or not anymore, I did write a program using a similar technique in Kotlin once but it was a while back). In PHP and Psalm, I can't just call an impure interface method from a pure function and pretend that is okay because it's like an event. I mean, I guess I could and suppress the Psalm issue, but I'm looking for something cleaner than that. I also can't just pass in an impure closure or callable and call it from a pure function.","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vimeo/psalm/issues/comments/1371802497/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"still-dreaming-1","id":354296,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1NDI5Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/354296?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/still-dreaming-1","html_url":"https://github.com/still-dreaming-1","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/still-dreaming-1/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/still-dreaming-1/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/still-dreaming-1/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/still-dreaming-1/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/still-dreaming-1/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/still-dreaming-1/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/still-dreaming-1/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/still-dreaming-1/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/still-dreaming-1/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vimeo/psalm/issues/comments/1372066395","html_url":"https://github.com/vimeo/psalm/issues/4077#issuecomment-1372066395","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vimeo/psalm/issues/4077","id":1372066395,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBG8K985RyBJb","user":{"login":"olleharstedt","id":607341,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYwNzM0MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/607341?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/olleharstedt","html_url":"https://github.com/olleharstedt","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olleharstedt/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olleharstedt/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olleharstedt/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olleharstedt/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olleharstedt/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olleharstedt/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olleharstedt/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olleharstedt/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olleharstedt/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-01-05T10:56:24Z","updated_at":"2023-01-05T10:56:24Z","body":"Highly non-idiomatic code, but check this reddit thread: https://old.reddit.com/r/PHP/comments/ifnrvu/effect_types_in_php_using_psalm_and_amphp/\r\n\r\nAnother way to make more code pure, inspired by tagless-final pattern: http://olleharstedt.github.io/programming/2022/03/22/one-universal-mock-to-rule-them-all.html","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vimeo/psalm/issues/comments/1372066395/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":1},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"olleharstedt","id":607341,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYwNzM0MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/607341?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/olleharstedt","html_url":"https://github.com/olleharstedt","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olleharstedt/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olleharstedt/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olleharstedt/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olleharstedt/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olleharstedt/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olleharstedt/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olleharstedt/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olleharstedt/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/olleharstedt/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}}]
