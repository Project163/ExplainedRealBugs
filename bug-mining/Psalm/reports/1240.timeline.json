(kind of).\r\n\r\nTechnically correct reply:\r\nIt's not suppressed but it reports the error for the stubs (and stubs errors are suppressed), instead of the actual `foo()`.\r\nThis issue affects ONLY @return errors, e.g. InvalidNullableReturnType, InvalidReturnType,...\r\n\r\nWhat seems to be happening internally:\r\nPsalm takes the stubs @return, but uses it for the actual function (ignoring the @return declared in the phpdoc of the actual function - this is fine, this is how psalm works, as it always gives higher priority to phpdoc of stubs) - therefore if the actual function returns something other than what was declared in the stubs, it will report these errors for the stubbed function instead of the actual function.\r\n\r\nSo the bug is NOT that it takes the phpdoc of the
