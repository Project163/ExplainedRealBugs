It does generate a `MixedAssignment`, but that's only INFO level, is supressed if `totallyTyped` is set to false, and is fairly cryptic.\r\n\r\nI just hit an issue where there was a method that looked like:\r\n\r\n```\r\n    public function __construct(string $url, array $config = [])\r\n    {\r\n        $use_proxy = $config['use_proxy'] ?? false;\r\n        /* bunch of stuff */\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis got copy and pasted into a fairly similar class, but it had different parameters:\r\n\r\n```\r\n    public function __construct(string $wsdl, array $options = [])\r\n    {\r\n        $use_proxy = $config['use_proxy'] ?? false;\r\n        /* bunch of stuff */\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe intended usage was to pass in a URL and an optional array of extra options, including an optional `use_proxy` flag which should default to false if not otherwise set.\r\n\r\nAnd the error is pretty clear here - the second param was renamed from `$config` to `$options`, but the bit where we tried to retrieve the `use_proxy` flag was never updated.  Unfortunately, with `totallyTyped` false, Psalm is totally silent about this, and even with `totallyTyped` true it doesn't treat it with the seriousness I would have expected.\r\n\r\nIs this a bug? Design decision? An option I haven't correctly set is Psalm?\r\n\r\nFWIW, Phan [seems to catch this](https://phan.github.io/demo/?code=%3C%3Fphp%0A%0Afunction+foo%28%29%3A+void%0A%7B%0A++++%24do_baz+%3D+%24config%5B%27do_it%27%5D%3B%0A++++if+%28%24do_baz%29+%7B%0A++++++++baz%28%29%3B%0A++++%7D%0A%7D%0A%0Afunction+bar%28%29%3A+void%0A%7B%0A++++%24do_baz+%3D+%24config%5B%27do_it%27%5D+%3F%3F+false%3B%0A++++if+%28%24do_baz%29+%7B%0A++++++++baz%28%29%3B%0A++++%7D%0A%7D%0A%0Afunction+baz%28%29%3A+void%0A%7B%0A%7D).\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"muglug","id":2292638,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyOTI2Mzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2292638?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug","html_url":"https://github.com/muglug","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vimeo/psalm/issues/2464/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vimeo/psalm/issues/2464/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
