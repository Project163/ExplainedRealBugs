And good correction on the examples `index()` and `true` were perhaps not making it immediately visible, sorry.\r\n\r\nFrom what I know this is a special property of  **IteratorIterator** and it makes sense (at least to humble me) having  an iterator as a decorator (but I know it can inherit surprises [next to *Traverable* being a PHP internal interface], referencing [Anthony Ferrara in Nov 2011 about IteratorIterator](https://blog.ircmaxell.com/2011/10/iteratoriterator-php-inconsistencies.html), IMHO wrongfully he was coining it as inconsistent, but I can understand the moment of realization as a WTF moment).\r\n\r\nProbably decorators are easy to handle for psalm and the case of **IteratorIterator** was never brought up, as these are annotated in code most often (e.g. `Subject|Decorator`), for a native decorator, this most certainly is not the case (there is no PHP code to add annotations to that psalm could infer
