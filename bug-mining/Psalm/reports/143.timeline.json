discussed with @Nyholm, this is a WIP patch containing happy-path scenarios (some of which are marked as `.disabled`, will talk to @muglug about those) that ensure the added type declarations work as expected.\r\n\r\nThe idea is that after a `@psalm-assert int $value`, the caller of `Assert::integer($value)` can assume `$value` to be `int`.\r\n\r\nThis is equivalent to the behavior of https://github.com/phpstan/phpstan-webmozart-assert, but the declarations are now closer to the source, and that makes for easier usage from the ecosystem (support by phpstan and phpstorm may come soon ;-) )\r\n\r\nAs for the prefixed annotation format: that is required to not trip over tools like `doctrine/annotations`.\r\n\r\nOther similar patches, for reference (since this is quite new stuff):\r\n\r\n * https://github.com/doctrine/collections/pull/177\r\n * https://github.com/Ocramius/ProxyManager/pull/465\r\n *
