don't think Psalm is mistaken here. Both [documentation](https://arnaud.le-blanc.net/php-rdkafka-doc/phpdoc/rdkafka.newtopic.html) and [extension source code](https://github.com/arnaud-lb/php-rdkafka/blob/cc11637e4530caca730f8a32a8d36fc1998eee8e/rdkafka.c#L465) says there's no method `newTopic` on `RdKafka\\Producer` class. Psalm sees that (via reflection) and uses correct callmap entry. \r\n\r\nBasically `RdKafka::newTopic` has a conditional return type based on LSB, but I'm not sure if it's possible to express that condition given the features we have right now. @muglug, can you advise if it's possible to use type of $this/static as a condition in a conditional return type (I tried `static is Type` and `$this is Type` but none of that worked for me)?
