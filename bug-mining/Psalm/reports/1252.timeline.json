 after upgrading to psalm 5.11, I am getting a spurious error that did not occur with a previous 5.x version of psalm (unfortunately I do not know the exact version I used before, I think I upgraded

as a string constant type. Therefore it should be able to know which member of the array shape is accessed when using `$name` as index, but apparently it does not. When I use the string literal as index instead (see second variant of the function), it works.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vimeo/psalm/issues/9801/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vimeo/psalm/issues/9801/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
