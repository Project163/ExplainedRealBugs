It would be nice to be able to use `@var` for `$matches` itself:\r\n\r\n``` php\r\n$text = '\r\nfoobar\r\nfoobaz\r\nfooqux\r\nfoobop\r\n';\r\n\r\npreg_match_all(\"/(?'word'foob[\\w]*)/\", $text, $matches);\r\n\r\n/**\r\n * @var array{\r\n *     word: string[]\r\n * } $params\r\n */\r\n$params = $matches;\r\n\r\nfor ($i = 0; $i < count($params['word']); $i++) {\r\n    echo $params['word'][$i] . \"\\n\";\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nhttps://psalm.dev/r/d1eac9433a","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vimeo/psalm/issues/comments/657797064/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"ramsey","id":42941,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyOTQx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/42941?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ramsey","html_url":"https://github.com/ramsey","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ramsey/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ramsey/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ramsey/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ramsey/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ramsey/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ramsey/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ramsey/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ramsey/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ramsey/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vimeo/psalm/issues/comments/657797143","html_url":"https://github.com/vimeo/psalm/issues/1916#issuecomment-657797143","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vimeo/psalm/issues/1916","id":657797143,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY1Nzc5NzE0Mw==","user":{"login":"psalm-github-bot[bot]","id":58627613,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90NTg2Mjc2MTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/48546?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/psalm-github-bot%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/psalm-github-bot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psalm-github-bot%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psalm-github-bot%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psalm-github-bot%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psalm-github-bot%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psalm-github-bot%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psalm-github-bot%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psalm-github-bot%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psalm-github-bot%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/psalm-github-bot%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-07-13T21:14:34Z","updated_at":"2020-07-13T21:14:34Z","body":"I found these snippets:\n<details>\n<summary>https://psalm.dev/r/d1eac9433a</summary>\n\n```php\n<?php\n$text = '\nfoobar\nfoobaz\nfooqux\nfoobop\n';\n\npreg_match_all(\"/(?'word'foob[\\w]*)/\", $text, $matches);\n\n/**\n * @var array{\n *     word: string[]\n * } $params\n */\n$params = $matches;\n\nfor ($i = 0;
