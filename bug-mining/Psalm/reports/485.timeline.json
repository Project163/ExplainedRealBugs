encountered a similar issue to https://github.com/vimeo/psalm/issues/4258 and https://github.com/vimeo/psalm/issues/2751.\r\n\r\nI see that some work has been done to avoid this issue as in https://github.com/vimeo/psalm/commit/50fc50fab03f63f9853a848a5833aaea14958620 but there is still an issue with `@param` annotation.\r\n\r\nExample of the issue (and a simplified use-case) is shown here: https://psalm.dev/r/cdf35ba896\r\n\r\nThe exact same code is working in PHPStan: https://phpstan.org/r/bcf918eb-626f-40cf-8b08-cbfa588f7b1f\r\n\r\nIs there any reason why class level template parameters are forbidden in the `@param` annotation or is it a bug?\r\n\r\nIt's not possible to replace it with\r\n```\r\n  /**\r\n   * @template TT\r\n   * @param list<TT> $enums\r\n   * @return static\r\n   */\r\npublic static function ...\r\n```\r\n\r\nAs that would loosen the type checking between the Enum and MultiEnum class. \r\n\r\nI actually **found a workaround** using `@template TT of T` annotation instead on the class methods and I'm fine with such solution if it's the expected way of doing it but I'd at least add it to the docs. \r\n(Workaround: https://psalm.dev/r/62775eb03c)\r\n\r\nThank you!\r\n
