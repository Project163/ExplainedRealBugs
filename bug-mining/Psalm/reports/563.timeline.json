the type of the object on the left hand side of this expression\r\n```\r\n\r\nI realise that this is extremely complex, but ideally I'd expect the return type of `makeThroughFactory()` (at the call site) to be inferred from the return type of `factory` (`InstanceType`), which is coupled to the input (`InputType of string`).\r\n\r\nIn practice, this allows chaining functions through pipe-alike structures. In following example, assumping `compose()` to be the function composition operation:\r\n\r\n```php\r\n$a = function (T1 $v) : T2 {}\r\n$b = function (T2 $v) : T3 {}\r\n$b = function (T3 $v) : T4 {}\r\n\r\n$composed = compose($a, compose($b, compose($c)));\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen `$composed` should be inferred as `function (T1 $v) : T4 {}`\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vimeo/psalm/issues/1999/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vimeo/psalm/issues/1999/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vimeo/psalm/issues/comments/596154164","html_url":"https://github.com/vimeo/psalm/issues/2896#issuecomment-596154164","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vimeo/psalm/issues/2896","id":596154164,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU5NjE1NDE2NA==","user":{"login":"ragboyjr","id":1975857,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NzU4NTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1975857?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ragboyjr","html_url":"https://github.com/ragboyjr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ragboyjr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ragboyjr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ragboyjr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ragboyjr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ragboyjr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ragboyjr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ragboyjr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ragboyjr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ragboyjr/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-03-08T01:06:10Z","updated_at":"2020-03-08T01:06:10Z","body":"Spent a bit more time on this and found a few other examples that we should probably support in this:\r\n\r\n```php\r\n// inferring return type from closure typings.\r\n/**\r\n * @template T\r\n * @template U\r\n * @param callable(T): U $predicate\r\n */\r\nfunction map(callable $predicate): callable {\r\n    return \r\n    /**\r\n     * @param iterable<T>\r\n     * @return iterable<U>\r\n     */\r\n

typescript equivalent:\r\n\r\n```typescript\r\nfunction map<T, U>(fn: (t: T) => U) {\r\n  return (iter: T[]): U[] => {\r\n    let newIter: U[] = [];\r\n    iter.forEach(v => newIter.push(fn(v)))\r\n    return newIter;\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd then finally, (i'm not sure if this should be a new ticket on its own), but allowing generic anonymous functions:\r\n\r\nTypescript syntax:\r\n\r\n```typescript\r\nfunction createGeneric() {\r\n  // the extends unknown is just a hack to get around parsing limitations\r\n  return <T extends unknown, U extends unknown>(fn: (t: T) => U, v: T): U => {\r\n    return fn(v);\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n```php\r\nfunction createGeneric() {\r\n  return\r\n  /**\r\n   * @template T\r\n   * @template U\r\n   * @param callable(T): U $fn\r\n   * @param T $v\r\n   * @return U\r\n   */\r\n   function(callable $fn, $v) { return $fn($v); };\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe only reason i'm including this is because I don't believe there's anyway to support this OTHER than type inference.","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vimeo/psalm/issues/comments/596154164/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"ragboyjr","id":1975857,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NzU4NTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1975857?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ragboyjr","html_url":"https://github.com/ragboyjr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ragboyjr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ragboyjr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ragboyjr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ragboyjr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ragboyjr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ragboyjr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ragboyjr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ragboyjr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ragboyjr/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":3129624309,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDMxMjk2MjQzMDk=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vimeo/psalm/issues/events/3129624309","actor":{"login":"ragboyjr","id":1975857,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NzU4NTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1975857?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ragboyjr","html_url":"https://github.com/ragboyjr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ragboyjr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ragboyjr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ragboyjr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ragboyjr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ragboyjr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ragboyjr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ragboyjr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ragboyjr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ragboyjr/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"32316d4fce7377e56533900bf0fec9b1e864d33d","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ragboyjr/psalm/commits/32316d4fce7377e56533900bf0fec9b1e864d33d","created_at":"2020-03-14T17:39:22Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"actor":{"login":"ragboyjr","id":1975857,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NzU4NTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1975857?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ragboyjr","html_url":"https://github.com/ragboyjr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ragboyjr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ragboyjr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ragboyjr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ragboyjr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ragboyjr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ragboyjr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ragboyjr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ragboyjr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ragboyjr/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-03-14T17:40:13Z","updated_at":"2020-03-14T17:40:13Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vimeo/psalm/issues/2945","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vimeo/psalm","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vimeo/psalm/issues/2945/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vimeo/psalm/issues/2945/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vimeo/psalm/issues/2945/events","html_url":"https://github.com/vimeo/psalm/pull/2945","id":577635618,"node_id":"MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0Mzg1MzY3MjQz","number":2945,"title":"Initial
