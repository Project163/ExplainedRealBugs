releases</a>.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<h2>Fix autocompletion in PHP 7.3</h2>\n<p>This used some extra arguments in <code>preg_replace_callback</code> that were only added in PHP 7.4. Also <a href=\"https://github.com/orklah\"><code>@​orklah</code></a> improved bit-shift operation return types (<a href=\"https://github.com/vimeo/psalm/issues/5233\">#5233</a>)</p>\n<h2>Improve autocompletion for functions</h2>\n<p>This release improves language server behaviour for autocompletion, and fixes some caching bugs triggered by invalid PHP.</p>\n<p>Also <a href=\"https://github.com/VincentLanglet\"><code>@​VincentLanglet</code></a> renamed some stubs to avoid conflicting with PHPStorm (<a href=\"https://github.com/vimeo/psalm/issues/5213\">#5213</a>)</p>\n<h2>Fix PHP 7.1-7.2 builds</h2>\n<p>4.5.0 introduced syntax incompatible with PHP 7.2, this fixes it – thanks to <a href=\"https://github.com/drealecs\"><code>@​drealecs</code></a>, and <a href=\"https://github.com/weirdan\"><code>@​weirdan</code></a> who prevented future regressions.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>fixes a possible infinite loop with some generic instantiation (<a href=\"https://github.com/vimeo/psalm/issues/5211\">#5211</a>)</li>\n<li>adds completions for function names thanks to <a href=\"https://github.com/joehoyle\"><code>@​joehoyle</code></a> (<a href=\"https://github.com/vimeo/psalm/issues/5128\">#5128</a>)</li>\n<li>allows <code>@psalm-type</code> to be used inside generics thanks to <a href=\"https://github.com/leightonthomas\"><code>@​leightonthomas</code></a>  (<a href=\"https://github.com/vimeo/psalm/issues/5205\">#5205</a>)</li>\n<li><code>array_key_exists</code> now behaves a little safer thanks to <a href=\"https://github.com/brainlock\"><code>@​brainlock</code></a> (<a href=\"https://github.com/vimeo/psalm/issues/5197\">#5197</a>)</li>\n<li>allow <code>is_array</code> check on a templated <code>iterable</code> (<a href=\"https://github.com/vimeo/psalm/issues/5198\">#5198</a>)</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Bugfixes</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Fix <a href=\"https://github.com/vimeo/psalm/issues/5196\">#5196</a> - improve type resolution of templated properties before checking default values</li>\n<li>Fix <a href=\"https://github.com/vimeo/psalm/issues/5194\">#5194</a> - don’t emit <code>NonInvariantDocblockPropertyType</code> when redefining core class properties</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This should also reinstate <code>psalm/phar</code> publishing</p>\n<h2>4.5.0</h2>\n<h2>Features</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/Danysan1\"><code>@​Danysan1</code></a> added support for CodeClimate (<a href=\"https://github.com/vimeo/psalm/issues/5030\">#5030</a>)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/bdsl\"><code>@​bdsl</code></a> added detection of property type variance in <a href=\"https://github.com/vimeo/psalm/issues/5131\">#5131</a>. Non-invariant property types causes a fatal error if the property types are specified in PHP code, but can also signal issues with your code if they're specified in docblocks. Psalm has two separate issues for this, <code>NonInvariantPropertyType</code> and <code>NonInvariantDocblockPropertyType</code>.</li>\n<li><strong>Taint Analysis</strong> <a href=\"https://github.com/adrienlucas\"><code>@​adrienlucas</code></a> added an option to dump the taint flow graph for debugging purposes (<a href=\"https://github.com/vimeo/psalm/issues/5080\">#5080</a>)</li>\n<li><strong>Language Server</strong> <a href=\"https://github.com/joehoyle\"><code>@​joehoyle</code></a> added support for static class method completion (<a href=\"https://github.com/vimeo/psalm/issues/5085\">#5085</a>) and completions for array keys (<a href=\"https://github.com/vimeo/psalm/issues/5105\">#5105</a>) and constants (<a href=\"https://github.com/vimeo/psalm/issues/5115\">#5115</a>)</li>\n<li>Thanks to <a href=\"https://github.com/weirdan\"><code>@​weirdan</code></a>, Psalm now emits exit code 1 <em>only</em> when it has internal issues. When it finds issues with your code it emits code 2 (<a href=\"https://github.com/vimeo/psalm/issues/5087\">#5087</a>)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/weirdan\"><code>@​weirdan</code></a> added checks to prevent invalid implementation of <code>Traversable</code> (<a href=\"https://github.com/vimeo/psalm/issues/5171\">#5171</a>)</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Changes</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>The meaning of <code>non-empty-string</code> has been clarified to mean &quot;every string except the empty string <code>''</code>&quot;. A new type, <code>non-falsy-string</code>, represents &quot;every string except the empty string and the string <code>'0'</code>&quot;. This follows PHP's treatment of falsiness, where the string <code>'0'</code> is treated as false.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Bugfixes</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Don't discard staticness of objects when combining types (<a href=\"https://github.com/vimeo/psalm/issues/5029\">#5029</a>)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/orklah\"><code>@​orklah</code></a> fixed <a href=\"https://github.com/vimeo/psalm/issues/5021\">#5021</a> by having Psalm calculate more literal values</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/lukasbestle\"><code>@​lukasbestle</code></a> fixed <a href=\"https://github.com/vimeo/psalm/issues/5037\">#5037</a> by removing the <code>SimpleXMLIterator</code>'s reliance on the new <code>\\Stringable</code> interface</li>\n<li>avoid false-positive in a dynamic property fetch inside a ternary</li>\n<li>prevent complex assertions from crashing reflection (<a href=\"https://github.com/vimeo/psalm/issues/5025\">#5025</a>)</li>\n<li>improve string non-emptiness combinations (<a href=\"https://github.com/vimeo/psalm/issues/5017\">#5017</a>)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/weirdan\"><code>@​weirdan</code></a> fixed <a href=\"https://github.com/vimeo/psalm/issues/5048\">#5048</a> by ensuring the autoloader is started in <code>psalm --init</code></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/danog\"><code>@​danog</code></a> fixed <a href=\"https://github.com/vimeo/psalm/issues/4289\">#4289</a> by checking iterator types in <code>yield from</code> expressions</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/weirdan\"><code>@​weirdan</code></a> fixed <a href=\"https://github.com/vimeo/psalm/issues/5057\">#5057</a> by adding flows to array spreads</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/weirdan\"><code>@​weirdan</code></a> ensured <code>class_alias()</code> calls are respected when accessing static properties (<a href=\"https://github.com/vimeo/psalm/issues/5068\">#5068</a>)</li>\n<li><strong>Language Server</strong> <a href=\"https://github.com/joehoyle\"><code>@​joehoyle</code></a> fixed a cache invalidation issue in language server mode (<a href=\"https://github.com/vimeo/psalm/issues/5084\">#5084</a>)</li>\n</ul>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n</blockquote>\n<p>...
