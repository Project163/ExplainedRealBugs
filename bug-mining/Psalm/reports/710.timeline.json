- to support a `string & !empty` type annotation?\r\n\r\nThen the desired nullable option for it would be `null | (string & !empty)`.\r\n\r\nAlso relevant:\r\n\r\n```php\r\n    /**\r\n     *

`generate.php` in this PR is really a quick and dirty implementation of a generator and it should not be looked too closely: the final implementation would be re-done almost entirely (though the idea would be kept).\r\n\r\nWhat I want to suggest you for discussion is the `Webmozart\\Assert\\Extra` class.\r\n\r\nIn the final implementation I suggest to rename the currently existing `Webmozart\\Assert\\Assert` to `Webmozart\\Assert\\Base`, and then `Webmozart\\Assert\\Extra` to `Webmozart\\Assert\\Assert` so that it was all transparent for the users.\r\n\r\nThe final implementation would come with a test that checks that the currently generated version and committed version is identical to the one that would have been generated now should you run `php generate.php`.\r\n\r\nThe current implementation generates 47 functions out of the list of all `allX` or `nullOrX` functions, and 9 are not supported probably due to possible psalm bugs (need investigation). You can see list of those in the `$temporaryUnsupported` variable.\r\n\r\nThoughts?\r\n\r\n/cc @Ocramius","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/webmozarts/assert/issues/126/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/webmozarts/assert/issues/126/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
