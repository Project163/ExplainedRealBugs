the discussion in #2433_ \r\n\r\nBelow, for any descendant of `Base`, `factory()` is expected to return an instance of the same class it was called on (and is flagged by Psalm if it doesn't). So where a type parameter is constrained to be `T of Base` we can assume `T::factory()` returns `T`. Thus `C::f()` should not be flagged with `InvalidReturnStatement`.\r\n\r\nhttps://psalm.dev/r/1a056c3be2\r\n```php\r\n<?php\r\nclass Base {\r\n  /** @return static */\r\n  public static function factory(): self {\r\n    return new self();\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\n/** \r\n * @template T of Base\r\n * @param class-string<T> $t\r\n * @return T \r\n */\r\nfunction f(string $t) {\r\n  return $t::factory(); // in functions it's fine\r\n}\r\n\r\n/** @template T of Base */\r\nclass C {\r\n  /** @var class-string<T> */\r\n  private string $t;\r\n\r\n  /** @param class-string<T> $t */\r\n  public function __construct($t) { $this->t = $t; }\r\n  \r\n  /** @return T */\r\n  public function f(): Base {\r\n    return ($this->t)::factory(); // and it should be allowed in methods just like it is for the function above\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n**Expected**: no issues\r\n**Actual**:\r\n```\r\nPsalm output (using commit 2b6831b):\r\n\r\nERROR: InvalidReturnStatement - 27:12 - The type 'T as Base' does not match the declared return type 'T:C as Base' for C::f\r\n\r\nERROR: InvalidReturnType - 25:15 - The declared return type 'T' for C::f is incorrect, got 'T'\r\n```","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vimeo/psalm/issues/2439/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vimeo/psalm/issues/2439/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vimeo/psalm/issues/comments/567858352","html_url":"https://github.com/vimeo/psalm/issues/1969#issuecomment-567858352","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vimeo/psalm/issues/1969","id":567858352,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU2Nzg1ODM1Mg==","user":{"login":"muglug","id":2292638,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyOTI2Mzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2292638?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug","html_url":"https://github.com/muglug","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-12-20T09:32:54Z","updated_at":"2019-12-20T09:32:54Z","body":"This turns out to be a fairly common ask.

Yeah - maybe it should be `class-string-map<T of Foo, T>`\r\n\r\nI think that's a good idea. Looking at the other threads it seems that wanting a class-string to map to a callable which returns that class is also a use case, which I hadn't considered.\r\n\r\nI think the syntax you suggested here does a good job to accommodate arbitrary placement of the class-string type within the value position. This would definitely be a *new* syntax behaviour, where there's sort of an unspecialised generic passed through the type arguments, which doesn't really become specialised until call time (where the generic serves to preserve the type relationship until then).\r\n\r\nIt's almost as if we want `class-string-map` to here actually accept a type (say `T`) which forms the upper constraint, and a [type constructor (kind `* -> *`)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kind_(type_theory)) called `U<_>` say, which is then passed down to the array accessor which is itself a generic of the signature:\r\n\r\n```php\r\n/**\r\n * @template V as T\r\n * @param class-string<V> $tClass\r\n * @return U<V>|null\r\n */\r\npublic function get($tClass);\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo something like the following if written as a class (of course in practice this would be a subtype of an array):\r\n\r\n```php\r\n/**\r\n * @template T\r\n * @template U<_>\r\n */\r\nclass class-string-map\r\n{\r\n    /**\r\n     * @template V as T\r\n     * @param class-string<V> $tClass\r\n     * @return U<V>|null\r\n     */\r\n    public function get($tClass);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou'd then need some way of specifying this type constructor inline, perhaps using `_` again, e.g.: if you wanted to return a callable: `callable():_`. Full declaration: `class-string-map<Foo, callable():_>` would mean that a variable of this type accepts `class-string`'s which are `Foo` or a subtype, and returns a callable which maps to the corresponding `class-string`. Similarly, `class-string-map<Foo, _>` would mean that a variable of this type accepts `class-string`'s which are `Foo` or a subtype (as before), but returns an instance of the type corresponding to the given class-string.\r\n\r\nMaybe this type of thing has been done elsewhere in another language, in which case it might be a good idea to lean on existing conventions?","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vimeo/psalm/issues/comments/568811962/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"aidantwoods","id":3288888,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyODg4ODg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3288888?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aidantwoods","html_url":"https://github.com/aidantwoods","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aidantwoods/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aidantwoods/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aidantwoods/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aidantwoods/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aidantwoods/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aidantwoods/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aidantwoods/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aidantwoods/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aidantwoods/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vimeo/psalm/issues/comments/569268876","html_url":"https://github.com/vimeo/psalm/issues/1969#issuecomment-569268876","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vimeo/psalm/issues/1969","id":569268876,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU2OTI2ODg3Ng==","user":{"login":"muglug","id":2292638,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyOTI2Mzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2292638?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug","html_url":"https://github.com/muglug","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-12-27T13:23:40Z","updated_at":"2019-12-27T13:23:40Z","body":"I'm
