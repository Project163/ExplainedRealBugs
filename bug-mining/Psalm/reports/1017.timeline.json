👋 \r\n\r\nI'm attempting to document the [`optional`](https://laravel.com/docs/8.x/helpers#method-optional) helper in laravel which essentially implements the null safe operator for php < 8\r\n\r\nI've tried to describe my issues and wrote a test in the [laravel plugin here](https://github.com/psalm/psalm-plugin-laravel/pull/122/files#diff-aa33824ad5550cd72668e51a9d0d1881c5f048f3af2233d08d48e202ba6a1e8aR23).\r\n\r\nI've spent quite a while trying to step through the psalm source code to debug the issue, but can't quite seem to solve it. I notice that no template params are being passed [here](https://github.com/vimeo/psalm/blob/master/src/Psalm/Internal/Analyzer/Statements/Expression/Call/Method/AtomicMethodCallAnalyzer.php#L292-L303), however when I pass them I then run into problems trying to inform psalm what method parameters are required here as no template args are passed to `MethodParamsProviderInterface`.\r\n\r\nWith that being said, I see that template parameters are properly passed to my `MethodReturnTypeProviderInterface` when `__call` is being checked as a fallback. However, the original \"called method name\" is not passed along.\r\n\r\nWould appreciate any pointers in the right direction!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vimeo/psalm/issues/4816/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vimeo/psalm/issues/4816/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"actor":{"login":"muglug","id":2292638,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyOTI2Mzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2292638?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug","html_url":"https://github.com/muglug","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-12-09T14:22:33Z","updated_at":"2020-12-09T14:22:33Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vimeo/psalm/issues/4818","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vimeo/psalm","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vimeo/psalm/issues/4818/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vimeo/psalm/issues/4818/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vimeo/psalm/issues/4818/events","html_url":"https://github.com/vimeo/psalm/issues/4818","id":760264988,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU3NjAyNjQ5ODg=","number":4818,"title":"False
