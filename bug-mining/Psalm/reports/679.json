In `C`, psalm seems to handle this correctly, not complaining about the return type.\r\n\r\nSo it seems like the `@method` tag in `B`'s DocBlock is handled differently from the actual method in `C`.","closed_by":{"login":"muglug","id":2292638,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyOTI2Mzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2292638?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug","html_url":"https://github.com/muglug","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vimeo/psalm/issues/3320/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vimeo/psalm/issues/3320/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
