This is the only Psalm error we have so it's not reporting any other issues with our PHPUnit usage, but this is the only place we use `TestCase::logicalOr`.\r\n\r\nWe also use `symfony/phpunit-bridge` which means that `phpunit/phpunit` is installed at `vendor/bin/.phpunit/phpunit-8.3.5-0` and that we have the following in `psalm.xml`:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<psalm\r\n        ...\r\n        autoloader=\"vendor/bin/.phpunit/phpunit-8.3.5-0/vendor/autoload.php\"\r\n>\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis has been working perfectly for over a year, however one of the testing bundles we're using ([LiipFunctionalTestBundle](https://github.com/liip/LiipFunctionalTestBundle)) recently made `phpunit/phpunit` a dependency, so we also have that installed in `/vendor` where we didn't have that before. My gut feel says this is some sort of problem with the autoloader and having phpunit installed twice, but I'm not sure.\r\n\r\n**What I've tried**\r\n1. Changing the `autoloader=` line `psalm.xml` so that it's not loading the `phpunit-bridge` version of phpunit and only the regular one, but the issue is still reported:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<psalm\r\n        ...\r\n        autoloader=\"vendor/autoload.php\"\r\n>\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n2. Removing `TestCase::logicalOr` and just using `TestCase:stringContains` (this returns a PHPUnit\\Framework\\Constraint\\StringContains), now psalm does not report any errors:\r\n\r\n```php\r\nTestCase::assertThat(\r\n    $this->getHtml(),\r\n    TestCase::stringContains($expected, false)\r\n);\r\n```\r\n\r\n3. Changing the `TestCase::logicalOr` to `TestCase::logicalAnd`, now it reports that `LogicalAnd` is undefined:\r\n\r\n```php\r\nTestCase::assertThat(\r\n    $this->getHtml(),\r\n    TestCase::logicalAnd(\r\n        TestCase::stringContains($expected, false),\r\n        TestCase::stringContains($htmlEncoded, false)\r\n    )\r\n);\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt seems weird that `StringContains` is defined but `LogicalOr` and `LogicalAnd` are not.
