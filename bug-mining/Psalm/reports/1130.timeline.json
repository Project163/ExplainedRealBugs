annotation prevents psalm from catching the issue.\r\n\r\nI was thinking about adding a `@psalm-type Type=array{array?: array-types, int?: int-types, etc}` to Union and having `getAtomicTypes()` return that, which would be beneficial in a lot of other places as well, but it's currently a `non-empty-array` and it's not possible to have a non-empty object like array when all keys are optional. It looks like object like arrays are _supposed_ to be nonempty when there are required keys, but that's a bit finicky too: https://psalm.dev/r/23869e7fec\r\n\r\nWould it be a good idea to add support
