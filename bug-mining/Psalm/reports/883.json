It is very important; [based on name](https://symfony.com/doc/current/form/events.html#a-the-formevents-pre-set-data-event), symfony will send different child of ``FormEvent``, and each child has different data.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nBut in version 3.15, psalm cannot recognize this stub and throws errors like this:\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1964158/92302934-9a296080-ef70-11ea-92f2-a4aa2988f433.png)\r\n\r\nAll events fails so I had to revert. I checked changelog, can't see anything that could be the problem.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nAm I doing something wrong or this is really a bug? Not sure how I can put a reproducer on psalm.dev (due to so many files needed) so some simple repository would probably be better.","closed_by":{"login":"muglug","id":2292638,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyOTI2Mzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2292638?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug","html_url":"https://github.com/muglug","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vimeo/psalm/issues/4136/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vimeo/psalm/issues/4136/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
