writing a library that I'm trying to make compatible across multiple major versions of a third party library, so I've written a shim.\r\n\r\nBasically, in the 3rd party library, a class was essentially renamed with the following technique:\r\n\r\n - 1.0.x `class B {}`\r\n - 1.1x `class A extends B {}` and `B` is marked as \"deprecated\" - consumers are encouraged to depend on `A` from now on\r\n - 2.x `class A {}` only - `B` has been removed\r\n\r\nHowever, I'm getting the following:\r\n\r\n```\r\nERROR: DuplicateClass - 12:11 - Class ThirdPartyLibrary\\A has already been defined in /var/www/vhosts/psalm.dev/httpdocs/src/../src/somefile.php\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn my example: https://psalm.dev/r/d6ea3719ab ... it seems `!class_exists(A::class)` is not being recognised here (or maybe the complication of the `class_exists(B::class)` is breaking something ?). \r\n\r\nI did see #2505 which has a VERY similar example (and I note that was fixed recently in `dev-master`). I wonder if the \"order of loading\" has something to do with this in autoloader? In my \"real\" code, I actually get an additional error:\r\n\r\n```\r\nERROR: MissingDependency - src/C.php:11:27 - ThirdPartyLibrary\\A depends on class or interface thirdpartylibrary\\b that does not exist\r\n    public function thing(A $a) : void {}\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor that full example, you can also see a test repo I made (since I can't seem to reproduce it in the psalm.dev editor): https://github.com/asgrim/psalm-shim-example","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vimeo/psalm/issues/2547/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vimeo/psalm/issues/2547/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
