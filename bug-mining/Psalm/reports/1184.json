If I have the PDO extension enabled locally, but composer doesn't require \"ext-pdo\" then psalm shouldn't load the PDO extension in case my local docker (or production!) environment doesn't use that extension.\r\n\r\nIt might also be a good idea to add a configuration option to enable or disable specific extensions in psalm.xml.","closed_by":{"login":"orklah","id":9605520,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk2MDU1MjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9605520?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/orklah","html_url":"https://github.com/orklah","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/orklah/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/orklah/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/orklah/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/orklah/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/orklah/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/orklah/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/orklah/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/orklah/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/orklah/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vimeo/psalm/issues/5482/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vimeo/psalm/issues/5482/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
