fixes #4872\r\n\r\nI was pretty confused for a moment, I expected two fixes: get rid of the taint when passing through params, and when passing through a return type\r\n\r\nHowever, as soon as I fixed the params one, both disappeared. I then realised that echo was treated as a function and it stopped registering taint given they were ints. I searched for sinks that are not functions (or treated as such by psalm) and couldn't find some. Maybe I'm mistaken on this.\r\n\r\nNote also that this PR represent a subtle change in behaviour: declaring that a function takes an int as a param or gives int as a return type *in phpdoc* will now remove possible taints. It may be possible to do so only if the type does not come from docblock but it seemed more aligned with Psalm's policy to trust types even in docblock","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vimeo/psalm/issues/6813/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vimeo/psalm/issues/6813/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
