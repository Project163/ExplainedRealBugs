This seem to work better:\r\n\r\nThanks for looking into it but then there is no type information on the returned object. Psalm will treat it as `object` and not an instance of the type that is passed as argument. Which means I need to add a typedoc for every usage of the container method.\r\n\r\nBut with this new hint of `$name is class-string` I got it to: https://psalm.dev/r/30724e7f25. So from that snippet I would say that the conditional type does not work as expected.
