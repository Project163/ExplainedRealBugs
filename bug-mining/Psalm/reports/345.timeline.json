in C# lang there is `IEnumerable<T>` interface, which is covariant, and it is something like iterable in PHP (because arrays are also IEnumerable).\r\nThere is also `IList<T> extends IEnumerable<T>`, which supports operations like add() or remove() and IList is NOT covariant. No contradiction here.","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vimeo/psalm/issues/comments/562057665/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"someniatko","id":15856706,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODU2NzA2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15856706?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/someniatko","html_url":"https://github.com/someniatko","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/someniatko/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/someniatko/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/someniatko/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/someniatko/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/someniatko/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/someniatko/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/someniatko/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/someniatko/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/someniatko/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vimeo/psalm/issues/comments/562058597","html_url":"https://github.com/vimeo/psalm/issues/2411#issuecomment-562058597","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vimeo/psalm/issues/2411","id":562058597,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU2MjA1ODU5Nw==","user":{"login":"someniatko","id":15856706,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODU2NzA2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15856706?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/someniatko","html_url":"https://github.com/someniatko","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/someniatko/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/someniatko/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/someniatko/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/someniatko/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/someniatko/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/someniatko/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/someniatko/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/someniatko/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/someniatko/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-12-05T10:02:36Z","updated_at":"2019-12-05T10:02:36Z","body":"both array and Traversable (and therefore, iterable) only RETURN some values, not operate on them.\r\n\r\nOf course, if we extend/implement Traversable interface and also add some functionality like `add(T $item)`, this extending interface or implementing class must not be covariant anymore.
