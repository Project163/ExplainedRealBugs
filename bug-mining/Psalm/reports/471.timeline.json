Motivation and context\r\n\r\nOverall, we know that a UUID can never be an empty string, hex, or numeric string. Even the zero-case is `'0'` in hex/int stringy form.\r\n\r\nThis patch formalizes that, allowing consumers of `UuidInterface` to rely on the fact that the produced `string` will never be empty.\r\n\r\n## How has this been tested?\r\n\r\nAdditional static-analysis tests were introduced: they just check variance.\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [x] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n\r\n## Checklist:\r\n- [x] My code follows the code style of this project.\r\n- [x] ~~My change requires a change to the documentation.~~\r\n- [x] ~~I have updated the documentation accordingly.~~\r\n- [x] I have read the **[CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/ramsey/uuid/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md)** document.\r\n- [x] I have added tests to cover my changes.\r\n- [x] All new and existing tests passed.\r\n- [x] I have run `composer run-script test` locally, and there were no failures or errors.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ramsey/uuid/issues/292/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ramsey/uuid/issues/292/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":2991800724,"node_id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDI5OTE4MDA3MjQ=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vimeo/psalm/issues/events/2991800724","actor":{"login":"muglug","id":2292638,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyOTI2Mzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2292638?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug","html_url":"https://github.com/muglug","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-01-30T02:47:05Z","label":{"name":"bug","color":"ee0701"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2991859218,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50Mjk5MTg1OTIxOA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vimeo/psalm/issues/events/2991859218","actor":{"login":"muglug","id":2292638,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyOTI2Mzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2292638?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug","html_url":"https://github.com/muglug","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":"933dff9e2057baad1f4140f06fdedd697dc8db04","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vimeo/psalm/commits/933dff9e2057baad1f4140f06fdedd697dc8db04","created_at":"2020-01-30T03:28:45Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
