`@template K as key-of<T>` shouldn't be defined at the class level - I've updated the example above to reflect proper usage, but there are still some bugs evident.\r\n\r\nthe idea with this was so that psalm wouldn't have to make a round trip to verify that `@template ID as key-of<T>` was present on `@template T as array<string, scalar|array|object|null>`, with the implicit linkage between `@return ID` in `Foo::IdProperty()`, `@return ID_VAL` on  `Foo::ObtainRepoId()` with the method body passing `Foo::IdProperty()` to `Foo::__get()` implicitly hinting that `ID_VAL` is the specific `value-of<T>` corresponding to `ID as key-of<T>`.
