Right now, param parsing is too incomplete to be used.\r\n\r\nI assume psalm is inferring that the PossiblyNullArgument would be the cause of a TypeError, or would be fixed/handled elsewhere instead of suppressed.\r\n\r\nNote that emitting TypeDoesNotContainType would be correct if strict_types was on.\r\n\r\n```php\r\n<?php\r\n\r\nclass MyClass {\r\n    public function getStr() : ?string {\r\n        return rand(0,1) ?

(strtoupper($g ?? '') === 'x' ?
