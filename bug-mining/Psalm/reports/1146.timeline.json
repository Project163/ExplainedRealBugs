is bug very similar to #5979, but contrary to this initial issue, my problems comes when the `code` element of the baseline contains a multi-line snippet. The fix was to `trim` the code content (that was relocated as part of the 5.x upgrade, but the idea remains the same), but that would remove only the characters at the beginning or the end of the string, but do not cater for potential carriage returns and line feeds inside the string.\r\nSo, depending on whether CRLF or LF mode is used, when the baseline is generated and/or compared, there may be respectively additional or missing `&#13;` characters in the baseline file, that means that errors are not recognised as part of the baseline if the environment do not use the same line ending. In my case, my dev environment is Windows, using CRLF, where the baseline is produced and I can get the \"No errors found!\" result, whilst the GitHub actions use a Linux environment, and LF mode, and fail (on a message not clear at all, as it seems identical to the baseline).\r\n\r\nI feel that the in the line below, there should be an harmonisation of the line endings, by maybe dropping the `&#13;` entity if present, so that CRLF will be harmonised to LF. Of course, this is not the only change that would be required, and that may \r\nneed to wait Psalm 6, or have an alternative solution, as this is maybe a breaking change.\r\nhttps://github.com/vimeo/psalm/blob/4eacb2f234867d34d8489f904c2445aecb9158d0/src/Psalm/ErrorBaseline.php#L121\r\n\r\nI have tried to showcase it in the [small example attached.](https://github.com/vimeo/psalm/files/10678807/test-bug.zip) (hopefully, it will make sense).\r\n\r\nUsing Psalm 5.6.0, I have created the same code twice, once in a file with CRLF endings, one with LF endings, to simulate the two environments. The anonymous function will of course raise an error, as an `int` is expected rather than `bool`.\r\n\r\n```php\r\n<?php\r\n$test = ['b', 'a'];\r\nusort($test, function (mixed $a, mixed $b): bool {\r\n    return $a <=> $b;\r\n});\r\nprint_r($test);\r\n```\r\nTaking the CRLF as reference for the baseline, it generates the below (which I manually duplicate for `test.LF.php`). Please note the `&#13;` entities to encode the carriage return; the line feed is not encoded, and is a line break in the file.\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\r\n<files psalm-version=\"5.6.0@e784128902dfe01d489c4123d69918a9f3c1eac5\">\r\n  <file src=\"test.CRLF.php\">\r\n    <InvalidArgument>\r\n      <code>function (mixed $a, mixed $b): bool {&#13;\r\n    return $a &lt;=&gt; $b;&#13;\r\n}</code>\r\n    </InvalidArgument>\r\n    ...\r\n  </file>\r\n</files>\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen, I run for the CRLF environment:\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n <summary>Running on CRLF environment</summary>\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ psalm --version\r\nPsalm 5.6.0@e784128902dfe01d489c4123d69918a9f3c1eac5\r\n\r\n$ psalm --config=psalm.CRLF.xml\r\nWarning: \"findUnusedCode\" will be defaulted to \"true\" in Psalm 6.
