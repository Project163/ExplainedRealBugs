When you have `Collection<Dog>`, you don't want `Cat` to be added to that collection. But if you define a function like this, it can happen without any warning from SA:\r\n\r\n```php\r\n/**\r\n * @template T of object\r\n * @param Collection<T> $c\r\n * @param T $d\r\n */\r\nfunction foo(Collection $c, object $d): void\r\n{\r\n    $c->add($d);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nBecause you can call it like this:\r\n\r\n```php\r\n/**\r\n * @param Collection<Dog> $c\r\n */\r\nfunction bar(Collection $c): void\r\n{\r\n    foo($c, new Cat()); // T is resolved to Cat|Dog, no error is reported\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nFull example: https://psalm.dev/r/8b6d92aee7 (no issues reported)\r\n\r\nWith my suggestion to treat `T` in `Collection<T>` same way as `callable(T)` is treated, this wouldn't be an issue, because `T` in `foo($c, new Cat());` would be resolved to `Cat` and `Collection<Cat>` doesn't accept `Collection<Dog>`.\r\n\r\nThank you for consideration.","closed_by":{"login":"muglug","id":2292638,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyOTI2Mzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2292638?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug","html_url":"https://github.com/muglug","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vimeo/psalm/issues/6066/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vimeo/psalm/issues/6066/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
