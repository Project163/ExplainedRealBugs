I don't have enough knowledge of the internals to understand how this issue related you the referenced issue\r\n\r\nSO\r\n\r\nPsalm currently supports three different ways of annotating arrays:\r\n\r\n- the generic `array<key, value>`\r\n  - which has a subtype `list<value>` for arrays where all items are indexed by sequential integers starting at zero\r\n- the object-like array type `array{foo: string, bar: int}`\r\n\r\nCalling `array_reverse` [without that second argument](https://github.com/vimeo/psalm/commit/e76beffa784c9c622fd14378c91068d75da1218b) with both `list<Foo>` and `array<int, Foo>` returns a `list<Foo>`.\r\n\r\nThat PR proposes adding another subtype to `array<key, value>` of `associative-array<key, value>` where Psalm will preserve those key-value associations. Importantly, a property of type `list` could not be assigned an `associative-array`-typed value and vice-versa.\r\n\r\nSo this code would not pass Psalm's checks:\r\n\r\n```php\r\nclass A {\r\n  /** @var associative-array<int, Foo> */\r\n  public array $map;\r\n\r\n  public function reverseIt() : void {\r\n    $this->map = array_reverse($this->map);\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n, failing with an error like `Cannot set $this->map of type associative-array<int, Foo> to type list<Foo>`","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vimeo/psalm/issues/comments/554783494/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"muglug","id":2292638,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyOTI2Mzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2292638?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug","html_url":"https://github.com/muglug","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vimeo/psalm/issues/comments/554872684","html_url":"https://github.com/vimeo/psalm/issues/2355#issuecomment-554872684","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vimeo/psalm/issues/2355","id":554872684,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU1NDg3MjY4NA==","user":{"login":"ADmad","id":142658,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MjY1OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/142658?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ADmad","html_url":"https://github.com/ADmad","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ADmad/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ADmad/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ADmad/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ADmad/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ADmad/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ADmad/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ADmad/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ADmad/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ADmad/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-11-18T06:31:35Z","updated_at":"2019-11-18T06:31:35Z","body":"Thanks for the explanation.
