Yes, but thanks for the reminder (was a while ago). This might be a good example to help me explain what I want.\r\n\r\n```\r\n<?php\r\n\r\nclass Counter {\r\n  /** @psalm-new-annotation */\r\n  public int $count = 0;\r\n  \r\n  public function increment() : void {\r\n    $this->count++;\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\nfunction makeCounter() : Counter {\r\n  $a = new Counter();\r\n  $a->increment(); // this is fine\r\n  return $a;\r\n}\r\n\r\nfunction canNotUpdateDirectly(Counter $a) : Counter {\r\n  $a->count = 10; // This is not allowed\r\n}\r\n\r\nfunction transformCount(Counter $a): array {\r\n  return [\r\n    'count' => $a->count, // Access without getter\r\n  ]\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo basically I can use a public property as getter, not as setter, but modify it through its class methods.\r\n\r\nAs far as I'm aware this behaviour can only made available with getter methods but not with psalm annotations. Basically I want to get rid of getters, because I have many instances where I only have them to get this result. And at the moment this means I have \"clean\" classes without getters and ones cluttered with them. It would be amazing if I could solve this issue with psalm 🙂
