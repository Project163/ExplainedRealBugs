I'd like to improve type hints using `psalter` but the problem is that `psalter` adds return types even when that is not safe.\r\n\r\nFor example, `psalter` will add native `void` return types. Unfortunately, some of those methods will be overridden in the project and return something.\r\n\r\nBasically, my question is: Can the code base be marked as a library? In that case `psalter` should not add native type hints to code that can be overridden. I'd still like to have native type hints for `final` classes or `private` methods.\r\n\r\nI realize this is probably not a common use case, feel free to close this if you think it's not worth it.","closed_by":{"login":"muglug","id":2292638,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyOTI2Mzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2292638?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug","html_url":"https://github.com/muglug","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vimeo/psalm/issues/1622/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vimeo/psalm/issues/1622/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
