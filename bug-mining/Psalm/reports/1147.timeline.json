if I send exit then yes the server exits. The issue is that when sending shutdown there are only two responses that should be sent according to the language sever protocol (the same one you linked). That being either a null or an error. I get an error thrown then immediately analyzing messages. This means the shutdown command was not executed because of an error. In the case of my IDE (vscode) it will never send exit because shutdown returned an error followed by analyzing messages. Hence shutdown is broken. \n\nI haven't tried yet but I believe shutdown needs to return the new Success(null) response at the end of the method instead of returning null to the yield. \n\nAdditionally I can cause this crash/error by sending any invalid message to the language server. I believe to fix this you just need to see if the response from dispatch is a null.
