The `ReflectionClass` constructor accepts a `class-string`, but it is also possible to pass an interface name to it.\r\n\r\nConsider the following code:\r\n```\r\n<?php\r\n\r\n/**\r\n * @psalm-param class-string $className\r\n */\r\nfunction funA(string $className): ReflectionClass\r\n{\r\n    return new ReflectionClass($className);\r\n}\r\n\r\nfunction funB(string $className)\r\n{\r\n    if (class_exists($className)) {\r\n        return funA($className);\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    if (interface_exists($className)) {\r\n        return funA($className);\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn this case, psalm will raise an error saying that I'm passing a `string` where a `class-string` was expected, after the `interface_exists` check.\r\n\r\nIf I add the `class-string` type to `$className` of `funB` psalm will say `class_exists($className)` is a redundant condition.\r\n\r\nI believe that making all interfaces to be considered valid `class-string` values would end up being too generic, but it would be nice to have a sort of hierarchy then, like `type-string`, `interface-string` and `class-string`, where both `interface-string` and `class-string` values could be assigned to a `type-string` variable/parameter/return.","closed_by":{"login":"muglug","id":2292638,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyOTI2Mzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2292638?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug","html_url":"https://github.com/muglug","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vimeo/psalm/issues/1657/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vimeo/psalm/issues/1657/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
