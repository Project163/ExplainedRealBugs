This is one such instance where continuing is fine as the error comes from the result of live typing so the code completion (that is erroring) is wrong as the time of typing the letters.\r\n\r\nThis is really hard to actually give a code reproduction because it relies on Psalm having a live cache and then that cache changing while live typing. You can see this in the reference issue against psalm-vscode-plugin\r\n\r\nSee attached PR for resolution: #7247","closed_by":{"login":"orklah","id":9605520,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk2MDU1MjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9605520?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/orklah","html_url":"https://github.com/orklah","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/orklah/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/orklah/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/orklah/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/orklah/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/orklah/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/orklah/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/orklah/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/orklah/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/orklah/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vimeo/psalm/issues/7246/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vimeo/psalm/issues/7246/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
