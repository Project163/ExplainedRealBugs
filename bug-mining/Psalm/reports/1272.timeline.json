writing to suggest an enhancement for this project, to improve its integration and ensure long-term reliability, particularly for package managers like apt, rpm, yum, nix, etc etc...\r\n\r\nThe primary goal here is to enable reproducibility of the exact build of the PHAR released, down to the last bit. This is crucial, especially when distributing it as a binary, for reasons of reliability and security.\r\n\r\nTo achieve this, I propose adding a `composer.lock` file to this repository. This file will ensure that the binary produced is reproducible on any system, regardless of environmental differences, by locking down specific versions of dependencies. Its absence currently hinders the ability to precisely replicate the builds you provide in your GitHub releases, introducing potential variability.\r\n\r\nFor reference, here are some projects that have recognized the value of versioning the `composer.lock` file:\r\n\r\n- https://github.com/sebastianbergmann/phpunit/pull/5576\r\n- https://github.com/bobthecow/psysh/issues/767\r\n- https://github.com/phpro/grumphp/issues/1095\r\n- https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/pull/255253\r\n- https://github.com/phpstan/phpstan-src/blob/1.11.x/composer.lock\r\n- https://github.com/vimeo/psalm/issues/10446\r\n\r\nIf there are concerns about including the `composer.lock` file in the main repository, could it be an option to add it to the release artefacts GitHub instead? This compromise would still greatly benefit reproducibility and consistency in dependency management.\r\n\r\nThank you for considering this enhancement. I look forward to your response.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/php-parallel-lint/PHP-Parallel-Lint/issues/153/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/php-parallel-lint/PHP-Parallel-Lint/issues/153/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"not_planned"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":16378834610,"node_id":"CE_lADOBG8K9854j2hEzwAAAAPQQS6y","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vimeo/psalm/issues/events/16378834610","actor":{"login":"danog","id":7339644,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjczMzk2NDQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7339644?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/danog","html_url":"https://github.com/danog","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danog/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danog/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danog/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danog/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danog/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danog/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danog/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danog/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danog/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":"ac95e2514f90757bc2de309db9b705638940ab3e","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vimeo/psalm/commits/ac95e2514f90757bc2de309db9b705638940ab3e","created_at":"2025-02-20T09:26:41Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":16378834672,"node_id":"REFE_lADOBG8K9854j2hEzwAAAAPQQS7w","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vimeo/psalm/issues/events/16378834672","actor":{"login":"danog","id":7339644,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjczMzk2NDQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7339644?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/danog","html_url":"https://github.com/danog","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danog/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danog/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danog/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danog/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danog/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danog/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danog/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danog/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danog/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"23c2d0efe5a0c80d5114c06a2f2c0f744decd325","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vimeo/psalm/commits/23c2d0efe5a0c80d5114c06a2f2c0f744decd325","created_at":"2025-02-20T09:26:41Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
