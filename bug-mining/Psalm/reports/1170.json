It would be great if Psalm could support this somehow so I don't have to choose between using the less readable `->add()`, `->mul()`, etc everywhere and littering code with `/** @psalm-suppress */`.\r\n\r\nI'm ok with any implementation that works, but I'm personally thinking it would be something like annotating a method with \r\n```\r\n/** \r\n * @psalm-overload-operator +\r\n * @param self|int|string $value\r\n * @return self\r\n */\r\n```\r\nor annotating the class with\r\n```\r\n/**\r\n * @psalm-overload-plus self|int|string -> self\r\n */\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt looks like Psalm already supports the operator overloading used by GMP, so hopefully it wouldn't be too much work to add annotations that expose similar functionality.","closed_by":{"login":"weirdan","id":57403,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3NDAz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/57403?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/weirdan","html_url":"https://github.com/weirdan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weirdan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weirdan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weirdan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weirdan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weirdan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weirdan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weirdan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weirdan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weirdan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vimeo/psalm/issues/3938/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vimeo/psalm/issues/3938/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
