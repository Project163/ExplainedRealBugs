like that if a class is aliased by another one (the alias definition only contains the `class_alias` instruction to the aliased class), psalm crashes with the class storage error.\r\n\r\nExample :

[\r\n        \"stripe_account\" => $accountId,\r\n    ]\r\n);\r\n```\r\n\r\nExpected psalm to report an error (if there are, didn't really check), had a crash with\r\n\r\n```\r\nPHP Fatal error:
