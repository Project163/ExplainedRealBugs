the moment there isn't a very good way to retrieve objects from an array indexed by their class string and have Psalm track this relationship.\r\n\r\nI'd like to tell Psalm that I have an array of type `array<class-string<Foo>, Foo>` where the class string in the key refers to ***the same*** `Foo` that will be returned. This is roughly equivalent to having a method of the following format as the array-accessor of an array:\r\n\r\n```php\r\n/**\r\n * @template T as Foo\r\n * @template-typeof T $fooClass\r\n * @param class-string<T> $fooClass\r\n * @return T|null\r\n */\r\npublic function get($fooClass);\r\n```\r\n\r\nAt the moment when I write something like:\r\n\r\n```php\r\ninterface Foo {}\r\n\r\nfinal class FooStorage\r\n{\r\n    /** @var array<class-string<Foo>, Foo> */\r\n    private $storage = [];\r\n  \r\n    /** @param Foo[] $Foos */\r\n    public function __construct($Foos)\r\n    {\r\n     \tforeach ($Foos as $Foo) {\r\n            $this->storage[\\get_class($Foo)] = $Foo;\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n  \r\n    /**\r\n     * @template T as Foo\r\n     * @template-typeof T $fooClass\r\n     * @param class-string<T> $fooClass\r\n     * @return T|null\r\n     */\r\n    public function get($fooClass)\r\n    {\r\n        return $this->storage[$fooClass] ?? null;\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nPsalm correctly flags an error since the array accessor on `$this->storage` is only guaranteed to return `Foo` and is not itself generic on the input. If possible, I'd like to tell Psalm that I will assign class strings to map to their objects using some special type (e.g. `class-string-map<T>`) so that something like:\r\n\r\n```php\r\ninterface Foo {}\r\n\r\nfinal class FooStorage\r\n{\r\n    /** @var class-string-map<Foo> */\r\n    private $storage = [];\r\n  \r\n    /** @param Foo[] $Foos */\r\n    public function __construct($Foos)\r\n    {\r\n     \tforeach ($Foos as $Foo) {\r\n            $this->storage[\\get_class($Foo)] = $Foo;\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n  \r\n    /**\r\n     * @template T as Foo\r\n     * @template-typeof T $fooClass\r\n     * @param class-string<T> $fooClass\r\n     * @return T|null\r\n     */\r\n    public function get($fooClass)\r\n    {\r\n        return $this->storage[$fooClass] ?? null;\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\nwould succeed.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vimeo/psalm/issues/1969/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vimeo/psalm/issues/1969/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":2509186042,"node_id":"MDEzOlJlb3BlbmVkRXZlbnQyNTA5MTg2MDQy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vimeo/psalm/issues/events/2509186042","actor":{"login":"muglug","id":2292638,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyOTI2Mzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2292638?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug","html_url":"https://github.com/muglug","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"reopened","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-07-25T11:25:44Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2509349724,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MjUwOTM0OTcyNA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vimeo/psalm/issues/events/2509349724","actor":{"login":"muglug","id":2292638,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyOTI2Mzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2292638?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug","html_url":"https://github.com/muglug","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":"2c89a97f9119db4ef8fa54ab0cdd248be84143c6","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vimeo/psalm/commits/2c89a97f9119db4ef8fa54ab0cdd248be84143c6","created_at":"2019-07-25T12:33:33Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vimeo/psalm/issues/comments/515030090","html_url":"https://github.com/vimeo/psalm/issues/1970#issuecomment-515030090","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vimeo/psalm/issues/1970","id":515030090,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUxNTAzMDA5MA==","user":{"login":"muglug","id":2292638,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyOTI2Mzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2292638?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug","html_url":"https://github.com/muglug","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-07-25T12:49:44Z","updated_at":"2019-07-25T12:49:44Z","body":"Sorry
