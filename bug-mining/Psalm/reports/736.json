The hash of the `config` is written to cache [here](https://github.com/vimeo/psalm/blob/013467dc0ea689ac0cdfaad48b79632c1c95e5ca/src/Psalm/Internal/Provider/FileReferenceCacheProvider.php#L53)\r\n2. Later on during initialization, The `composer_lock_hash` is  written, but the cache directory [is first removed](https://github.com/vimeo/psalm/blob/013467dc0ea689ac0cdfaad48b79632c1c95e5ca/src/Psalm/Internal/Analyzer/ProjectAnalyzer.php#L289). This removes the `config` cache written in step 1.\r\n\r\non run 2:\r\n\r\n1. the `config` cache is not present, so the config is detected as \"changed\", and a complete rescan is done.\r\n\r\non run 3:\r\n\r\n1. the `config` cache is present, all caches are fully primed. the scan is a no-op.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"muglug","id":2292638,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyOTI2Mzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2292638?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug","html_url":"https://github.com/muglug","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vimeo/psalm/issues/3367/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vimeo/psalm/issues/3367/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
