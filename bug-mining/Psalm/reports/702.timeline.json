much a work in progress, comments welcome.\r\nFix for #5371\r\n\r\nI would like to have property invariance checks work correctly, but for now I'll at least settle for disabling them for properties containing a template.\r\n\r\nSo far I've changed `Union::hasTemplate` to check for arrays, lists, class-string-maps, and iterables containing templates, and the tests all pass. If this is the desired behavior of `hasTemplate` there's also `TGenericObject`, and possibly `TCallable` and others I haven't considered yet.\r\n\r\nAny advice is much appreciated. I'm also trying to figure out how to update ClassAnalyzer.php:708 to check if `$guide_property_storage` has a template that's used by `$property_storage`, and then maybe clone `$guide_property_storage` and set the template to what `$property_storage` has before doing the `->equals` check, but I bet there's a better way to do that, cloning doesn't sound great for performance.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vimeo/psalm/issues/5380/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vimeo/psalm/issues/5380/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
