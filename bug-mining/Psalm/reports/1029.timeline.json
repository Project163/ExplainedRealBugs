you remember that we tried out the PHPStan static analyzer tool a few years ago and weren't happy with its many false-positives.\r\n\r\nStatic analysis in general is really powerful though and so I used the opportunity of switching to GitHub Actions to take a look at the topic again. PHPStan still doesn't really fit for our type of code-base and I couldn't even get it to work anymore. That left Phan and Psalm. Phan looks quite good too, but Psalm has really nice documentation and works quite well out of the box, so I integrated it into our CI process.\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes the code issues we need to fix to get to Psalm level 7 (the second-lowest in a scale where level 1 is strictest and level 8 is most lenient). Levels 6 and up need a lot more changes to our code, but I think it's good to already start somewhere.\r\n\r\nI have split the different types of changes into separate commits and added an explanation in the commit message where necessary.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/getkirby/kirby/issues/3035/reactions","total_count":3,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":1,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/getkirby/kirby/issues/3035/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":4159923738,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDQxNTk5MjM3Mzg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vimeo/psalm/issues/events/4159923738","actor":{"login":"lukasbestle","id":1595007,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1OTUwMDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1595007?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukasbestle","html_url":"https://github.com/lukasbestle","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukasbestle/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukasbestle/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukasbestle/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukasbestle/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukasbestle/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukasbestle/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukasbestle/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukasbestle/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukasbestle/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"bef648c652fe6c63128811c2f816421ae740c80c","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/lukasbestle/psalm/commits/bef648c652fe6c63128811c2f816421ae740c80c","created_at":"2020-12-31T16:18:57Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"actor":{"login":"lukasbestle","id":1595007,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1OTUwMDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1595007?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukasbestle","html_url":"https://github.com/lukasbestle","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukasbestle/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukasbestle/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukasbestle/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukasbestle/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukasbestle/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukasbestle/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukasbestle/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukasbestle/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lukasbestle/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-12-31T16:20:01Z","updated_at":"2020-12-31T16:20:01Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vimeo/psalm/issues/4922","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vimeo/psalm","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vimeo/psalm/issues/4922/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vimeo/psalm/issues/4922/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vimeo/psalm/issues/4922/events","html_url":"https://github.com/vimeo/psalm/pull/4922","id":777076732,"node_id":"MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0NTQ3NDYxMzcy","number":4922,"title":"Full
