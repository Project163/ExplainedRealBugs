#5039\r\nFixes #7831\r\n\r\nThis patch removes the need for a custom function return type\r\nprovider for `explode()`, and instead replaces all that with a single\r\nstub for the `explode()` function, which provides types for some of\r\nthe most common `$limit` input values.\r\n\r\nWith this change, the `$delimiter` is enforced to be a `non-empty-string`,\r\nwhich will lead to downstream consumers having to adjust some code accordingly,\r\nbut that shouldn't affect the most common scenario of exploding a string\r\nbased with a constant `literal-string` delimiter, which most PHP devs tend to do.\r\n\r\nThis change didn't come with an accompanying test, since that would be a bit\r\nwasteful, but it was verified locally with following script:\r\n\r\n```php\r\n<?php\r\n\r\n$possible0  = explode(',', 'hello, world', -100);\r\n$possible1  = explode(',', 'hello, world', -1);\r\n$possible2  = explode(',', 'hello, world', 0);\r\n$possible3  = explode(',', 'hello, world', 1);\r\n$possible4  = explode(',', 'hello, world', 2);\r\n$possible5  = explode(',', 'hello, world', 3);\r\n$possible6  = explode(',', 'hello, world', 4);\r\ntry {\r\n    $impossible1 = explode('', '', -1);\r\n} catch (Throwable $impossible1) {}\r\n\r\n$traced = [$possible0, $possible1, $possible2, $possible3, $possible4, $possible5, $possible6, $impossible1];\r\n\r\n/** @psalm-trace $traced
