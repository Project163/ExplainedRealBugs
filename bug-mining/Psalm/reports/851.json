When I annotate the closure so that `$a` and `$b` are of type `A|B` it results in a strange false positive `InvalidArgument - Type A|B should be a subtype of A|B&A`: https://psalm.dev/r/b6e95bbb53\r\n\r\nExtending the closure to 3 classes, but leaving the array as 2, it seems that it's doing something weird to misinterpret the closure annotation.
