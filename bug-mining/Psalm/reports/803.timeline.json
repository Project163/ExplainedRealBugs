to #3516 \r\n\r\nMotivation:\r\n- If psalm crashes in CI because of a corrupt cache or an edge case such as #3671 , there should be a way to recover from it gracefully without increasing the overall disk space. Changing the cacheDirectory field isn't perfect, because there would be multiple caches for the same project folder, which was one reason why 3671 was rejected.\r\n\r\nImplementation details:\r\n- If $CACHE_DIR/cache_version does not exist, create it (or put it into an appropriate file that's already read\r\n- If $CACHE_DIR/cache_version's trimmed contents are different from the trimmed cacheVersion value, then erase all of the contents of $CACHE_DIR and proceed as if the cache directory was originally empty\r\n- If the $CACHE_DIR/cache_version is the same, then proceed normally\r\n- If cacheVersion is not set, treat it like the string `0` so that setting it in the future would clear the cache","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vimeo/psalm/issues/3677/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vimeo/psalm/issues/3677/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vimeo/psalm/issues/comments/649661516","html_url":"https://github.com/vimeo/psalm/issues/3671#issuecomment-649661516","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vimeo/psalm/issues/3671","id":649661516,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY0OTY2MTUxNg==","user":{"login":"TysonAndre","id":1904430,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5MDQ0MzA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1904430?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/TysonAndre","html_url":"https://github.com/TysonAndre","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TysonAndre/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TysonAndre/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TysonAndre/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TysonAndre/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TysonAndre/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TysonAndre/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TysonAndre/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TysonAndre/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TysonAndre/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-06-25T16:08:44Z","updated_at":"2020-06-25T16:11:27Z","body":"I see that enabling `--no-file-cache` is a possible workaround for this.
