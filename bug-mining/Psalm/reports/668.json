These classes implement `__get` and `__call` to proxy property and method calls to the underlying model. To goal of these classes is to transform a model to eg. a JSON representation for API calls.\r\n\r\nIn general, you'd add an `@mixin` docblock on all these resources, eg:\r\n\r\n```php\r\n/** @mixin \\App\\Context\\Product\\Types\\Event\\Models\\Event */\r\nclass EventGeneralCardResource extends JsonResource\r\n{\r\n    public function toArray($request)\r\n    {\r\n        return [\r\n            'name' => $this->name,\r\n        ];\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis allows PhpStorm to know that `$this->name` actually refers to the property `$name` on the `Event` model.\r\n\r\nPsalm however seems to not recognise this:\r\n\r\n```\r\nERROR: UndefinedThisPropertyFetch - app/Http/Staff/Resources/Product/EventGeneralCardResource.php:13:23 - Instance property App\\Http\\Staff\\Resources\\Product\\EventGeneralCardResource::$name is not defined (see https://psalm.dev/041)\r\n            'name' => $this->name,\r\n```","closed_by":{"login":"muglug","id":2292638,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyOTI2Mzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2292638?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug","html_url":"https://github.com/muglug","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vimeo/psalm/issues/3263/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vimeo/psalm/issues/3263/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
