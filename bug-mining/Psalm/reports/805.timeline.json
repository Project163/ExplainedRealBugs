This means it should take the same time, but avoid a double scan, which happens right now in the above scenario. Psalm takes around 6 seconds to scan my stub file (it's a stub of all wordpress functions and classes), so just setting it to deep scan initially would save a lot of time, and also solve the problem I have with a shallow scan on _some_ stubs, and then deep scans on others changing the order of stubbed function

many sitations, stub files will receive a shallow _and_ deep scan when project files require extra analysys on things like parent classes. This makes stub file scanning inconsistent (orders become much less predictable for example), and adds extra process time to scan the files twice. In the case of stubs providing classes and functions for large projects, this is a non-trivial amount of time.\n\nAs deep scanning stubs should take just about as long as a shallow scan, it makes sense to just always deep scan them.\n\nFixes #3568.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vimeo/psalm/issues/3781/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vimeo/psalm/issues/3781/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":3527143009,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MzUyNzE0MzAwOQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vimeo/psalm/issues/events/3527143009","actor":{"login":"muglug","id":2292638,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyOTI2Mzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2292638?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug","html_url":"https://github.com/muglug","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-07-08T21:42:52Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3527143082,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDM1MjcxNDMwODI=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vimeo/psalm/issues/events/3527143082","actor":{"login":"muglug","id":2292638,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyOTI2Mzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2292638?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug","html_url":"https://github.com/muglug","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"0119cd09c11ea1630d4fe2c99f9b5c52d8063272","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vimeo/psalm/commits/0119cd09c11ea1630d4fe2c99f9b5c52d8063272","created_at":"2020-07-08T21:42:54Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
