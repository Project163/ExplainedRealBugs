#8983\r\n\r\nThis patch adds a basic test showing that, when reaching a union type with 30 elements or more, Psalm used to fail with an error, because the large union type got simplified into a more general type as part of performance optimizations done in `TypeCombiner::combine()`.\r\n\r\nThis means that a type like `array<1|2|3|(etcetera...)|100, mixed>` was internally simplified to `array<int, mixed>`, after reaching 30 elements or more, which in turn led to problems and confusing errors when large union types are in play.\r\n\r\nSuch union types are relatively common in lookup-table-alike value objects.\r\n\r\nBy removing the hardcoded call-time limit of `30` types to be combined, we hereby rely on the default `TypeCombiner::combine()` limit of `500` items, which is more healthy.\r\n\r\nThis may come with some performance implications, but it is worth trying out, for now.\r\n\r\nFurther parameters passed to `TypeCombiner::combine()` that were already matching parameter default values were also omitted from the call-sites.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vimeo/psalm/issues/9022/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vimeo/psalm/issues/9022/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":8125316379,"node_id":"CE_lADOBG8K985Z3mE_zwAAAAHkTn0b","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vimeo/psalm/issues/events/8125316379","actor":{"login":"orklah","id":9605520,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk2MDU1MjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9605520?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/orklah","html_url":"https://github.com/orklah","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/orklah/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/orklah/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/orklah/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/orklah/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/orklah/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/orklah/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/orklah/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/orklah/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/orklah/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-12-29T09:48:06Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":8125316434,"node_id":"REFE_lADOBG8K985Z3mE_zwAAAAHkTn1S","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vimeo/psalm/issues/events/8125316434","actor":{"login":"orklah","id":9605520,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk2MDU1MjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9605520?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/orklah","html_url":"https://github.com/orklah","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/orklah/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/orklah/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/orklah/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/orklah/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/orklah/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/orklah/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/orklah/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/orklah/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/orklah/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"5bfb87c62471f49510e037bd457bd410b06aa59b","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vimeo/psalm/commits/5bfb87c62471f49510e037bd457bd410b06aa59b","created_at":"2022-12-29T09:48:07Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
