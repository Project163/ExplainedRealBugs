functions (like `json_decode()` or `preg_match_all`) can change behavior based on a bitmask argument.  For example:\r\n\r\n| Function | Flags | Behavior |\r\n| --- | --- | --- |\r\n| `json_decode()` | (none) | Does not throw exceptions |\r\n| `json_decode()` | `JSON_THROW_ON_ERROR` | May throw a `JsonException` |\r\n| `preg_match_all()` | `PREG_PATTERN_ORDER` (default) | `$matches` argument will be of type `array<array-key, array<int, string>>|null` |\r\n| `preg_match_all()` | `PREG_SET_ORDER` | `$matches` argument will be of type `array<int, array<array-key, string>>|null` |\r\n| `preg_match_all()` | `PREG_OFFSET_CAPTURE` or `PREG_PATTERN_ORDER\\|PREG_OFFSET_CAPTURE` | `$matches` argument will be of type `array<array-key, array<int, array{0: string, 1: int}>>|null` |\r\n| `preg_match_all()` | `PREG_SET_ORDER\\|PREG_OFFSET_CAPTURE` | `$matches` argument will be of type `array<int, array<array-key, array{0: string, 1: int}>>|null` |\r\n| `preg_match_all()` | `PREG_UNMATCHED_AS_NULL` or `PREG_PATTERN_ORDER\\|PREG_UNMATCHED_AS_NULL` | `$matches` argument will be of type `array<array-key, array<int, string\\|null>>|null` |\r\n| `preg_match_all()` | `PREG_SET_ORDER\\|PREG_UNMATCHED_AS_NULL` | `$matches` argument will be of type `array<int, array<array-key, string\\|null>>|null` |\r\n| `preg_match_all()` | `PREG_SET_ORDER\\|PREG_UNMATCHED_AS_NULL\\|PREG_OFFSET_CAPTURE` | `$matches` argument will be of type `array<int, array<array-key, array{0: string\\|null, 1: int}>>|null` |\r\n\r\nIf we could add support for a new `bitmask` type that would open up some new possibilities:\r\n\r\n - Validating that only known flags are being set\r\n - Providing more-accurate definitions for internal function behaviors and types\r\n\r\nPerhaps this could be a superset of the `int` type?  It could automatically be \"applied\" to any `int` that has bitwise operators performed on it, or if a known bitwise constant value is assigned to a variable.\r\n\r\nSomething like this would likely fix #4128 since we'd know exactly what types would be returned.  Yes, this would require several very-verbose type definitions as shown above, but that might be better than having no information at all (current behavior).","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vimeo/psalm/issues/4135/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vimeo/psalm/issues/4135/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":3731871188,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MzczMTg3MTE4OA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vimeo/psalm/issues/events/3731871188","actor":{"login":"muglug","id":2292638,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyOTI2Mzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2292638?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug","html_url":"https://github.com/muglug","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":"4d82d3ddad18b9d3e3e84b6535b939fe51432491","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vimeo/psalm/commits/4d82d3ddad18b9d3e3e84b6535b939fe51432491","created_at":"2020-09-04T22:15:03Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3734021002,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDM3MzQwMjEwMDI=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vimeo/psalm/issues/events/3734021002","actor":{"login":"colinodell","id":202034,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwMjAzNA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/202034?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/colinodell","html_url":"https://github.com/colinodell","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/colinodell/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/colinodell/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/colinodell/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/colinodell/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/colinodell/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/colinodell/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/colinodell/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/colinodell/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/colinodell/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"b5c807a00c7f14fd2cd6ef898a4257e30ade0f0b","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/thephpleague/commonmark/commits/b5c807a00c7f14fd2cd6ef898a4257e30ade0f0b","created_at":"2020-09-06T13:56:42Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3738103119,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDM3MzgxMDMxMTk=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vimeo/psalm/issues/events/3738103119","actor":{"login":"muglug","id":2292638,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyOTI2Mzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2292638?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug","html_url":"https://github.com/muglug","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"d7a0df9ad9313ef8a190f0a411d11ea008f2a3aa","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vimeo/psalm/commits/d7a0df9ad9313ef8a190f0a411d11ea008f2a3aa","created_at":"2020-09-07T18:08:46Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":4265550950,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDQyNjU1NTA5NTA=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vimeo/psalm/issues/events/4265550950","actor":{"login":"danog","id":7339644,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjczMzk2NDQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7339644?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/danog","html_url":"https://github.com/danog","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danog/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danog/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danog/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danog/starred
