A constructor A's statement list is modified\r\n2. A class which invokes `A::__construct` is deleted\r\n3. There is an issue in the way that class's constructor invokes `A::__construct`\r\n\r\n```\r\n» ../psalm/psalm  --threads=1\r\nScanning files...\r\nAnalyzing files...\r\n\r\nUncaught InvalidArgumentException: Could not get class storage for other in /path/to/psalm/src/Psalm/Internal/Provider/ClassLikeStorageProvider.php:45\r\nStack trace:\r\n#0 /path/to/psalm/src/Psalm/Internal/Codebase/Analyzer.php(673): Psalm\\Internal\\Provider\\ClassLikeStorageProvider->get('other')\r\n#1 /path/to/psalm/src/Psalm/Internal/Codebase/Analyzer.php(251): Psalm\\Internal\\Codebase\\Analyzer->loadCachedResults(Object(Psalm\\Internal\\Analyzer\\ProjectAnalyzer))\r\n#2 /path/to/psalm/src/Psalm/Internal/Analyzer/ProjectAnalyzer.php(621): Psalm\\Internal\\Codebase\\Analyzer->analyzeFiles(Object(Psalm\\Internal\\Analyzer\\ProjectAnalyzer), 1, false, true)\r\n#3 /path/to/psalm/src/psalm.php(601): Psalm\\Internal\\Analyzer\\ProjectAnalyzer->check('/path/to...', false)\r\n#4 /path/to/psalm/psalm(2): require_once('/path/to...')\r\n#5 {main}\r\n(Psalm 3.x-dev@... crashed due to an uncaught Throwable)\r\n```\r\n\r\nSeen in de85e7c539033253ccece17d2b38ae6e9165cd55 and probably an issue for weeks or longer.\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\n1. Create psalm.xml with cacheDirectory configured. Remove other files from src/ of the project\r\n2. `rm -rf /path/to/cacheDir`\r\n3. Replace src/base.php with the first file contents. Run `/path/to/psalm --threads=1`\r\n4. Replace src/base.php with the second file contents. Run `/path/to/psalm --threads=1` again.\r\n    Observed: Psalm crashes with the above stack trace on this run and subsequent runs\r\n\r\n```php\r\n<?php\r\n// ==> src/base.php (version 1) <==\r\nclass base {\r\n    public function __construct(string $required) {\r\n        echo \"\\n\";\r\n    }\r\n}\r\nclass other extends base {\r\n    public function __construct() {\r\n        parent::__construct();  // too few arguments is deliberate\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn the second version, the contents of `base::__construct` were changed, and class with the call to `base::__construct` which caused an issue to be emitted was removed\r\n\r\n```php\r\n<?php\r\n// ==> src/base.php (version 2) <==\r\nclass base {\r\n    public function __construct(string $required) {\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nPsalm is also affected by manual calls to `new base()` from within a constructor.\r\n\r\nThis can be seen in CI when switching between branches. If one change adds a subclass and triggers an issue calling the parent constructor (and modifies the parent constructor), then triggering a build with an older branch will reproduce this issue.","closed_by":{"login":"muglug","id":2292638,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyOTI2Mzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2292638?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug","html_url":"https://github.com/muglug","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vimeo/psalm/issues/3671/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vimeo/psalm/issues/3671/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
