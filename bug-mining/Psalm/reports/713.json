In this case, `\\Eloquent` is an undefined class.\r\n\r\nI believe Psalm should emit the likes of a class not found error, rather than crashing with an error message that  won't be clear to new  users\r\n\r\n>Uncaught InvalidArgumentException: Could not get class storage for eloquent in E:\\laragon\\www\\app\\vendor\\vimeo\\psalm\\src\\Psalm\\Internal\\Provider\\ClassLikeStoragePro\r\nvider.php:45\r\n\r\n---------\r\nI'm also tracking this over at the laravel plugin https://github.com/psalm/psalm-plugin-laravel/issues/72 as `\\Eloquent` mixin is quite common  as the class is defined by Laravel-ide-helper, and therefore supported in the Laravel plugin","closed_by":{"login":"muglug","id":2292638,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyOTI2Mzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2292638?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug","html_url":"https://github.com/muglug","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vimeo/psalm/issues/3452/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vimeo/psalm/issues/3452/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
