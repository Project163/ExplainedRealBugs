not familiar with how psalm implements this.\r\n\r\nOne way to deal with this is to create a class to represent lazily loaded union type (with a closure that's called to resolve the value in the codebase), and only resolve the actual value of the union type the first time analysis needs to know the union type (which, most of the time, is after all of the classes are parsed)\r\n\r\n- The file or line with the constant's value won't be available at the time the constant is first parsed, which is why lazy loading is suggested\r\n- This might be harder for class constants in classes that are already lazily loaded (e.g. `vendor/`)\r\n- https://github.com/phan/phan/blob/master/src/Phan/Language/FutureUnionType.php and
