Description\r\n\r\nRef https://github.com/vimeo/psalm/issues/9350\r\n\r\nEnabling JIT on an ARM64 machine with `opcache.jit=1205` triggers an impossible assertion (`count($result_type_parts) === $combinations` where `$result_type_parts` is an array with 1 element and `$combinations` is 1).\r\n\r\nUsing `opcache.jit=1254` fixes the issue.\r\nRunning `var_dump($result_type_parts, $combinations);` before the assertion also fixes the issue.\r\n\r\nTo reproduce, enable opcache, enable assertions, create an empty composer project, install vimeo/psalm:5.7.1 and scan the following file (`vendor/bin/psalm --no-cache a.php`):\r\n\r\n```\r\n<?php\r\n\r\n$v = __DIR__ . '';\r\n```\r\n\r\nExpected result: No AssertionError, like when running on x86_64\r\n\r\nActual result:\r\n```\r\n[daniil@pi4 t]$ vendor/bin/psalm --no-cache a.php\r\nWarning: \"findUnusedCode\" will be defaulted to \"true\" in Psalm 6.
