[vimeo/psalm](https://github.com/vimeo/psalm) from 4.2.1 to 4.3.0.\n<details>\n<summary>Release notes</summary>\n<p><em>Sourced from <a href=\"https://github.com/vimeo/psalm/releases\">vimeo/psalm's releases</a>.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<h2>4.3.0</h2>\n<h2>Features</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><code>UnusedConstructor</code> is now a separate issue from <code>UnusedMethod</code>. This allows people to use the private constructor pattern to prevent instantiation of classes that just have static methods (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/vimeo/psalm/issues/4656\">#4656</a>)</li>\n<li><code>RedundantCast</code> is now a separate issue from <code>RedundantCondition</code>. It is now emitted for more redundant casts thanks to <a href=\"https://github.com/orklah\">@orklah</a> adding better detection (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/vimeo/psalm/issues/4695\">#4695</a>)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/odoucet\">@odoucet</a> added support for the CodeClimate output format (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/vimeo/psalm/issues/4387\">#4387</a>)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/weirdan\">@weirdan</a> added a test to ensure all new Psalm annotations are documented (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/vimeo/psalm/issues/4723\">#4723</a>)</li>\n<li><code>RedundantPropertyInitializationCheck</code> is now emitted for <code>isset</code> checks on class properties that Psalm thinks should be defined. This allows users who prefer to initialize properties outside constructors to silence just that issue (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/vimeo/psalm/issues/4732\">#4732</a>)</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Bugfixes</h2>\n<h3>Psalter</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/orklah\">@orklah</a> added support for adding <code>static</code> return types when running in PHP 8 (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/vimeo/psalm/issues/4641\">#4641</a>)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/orklah\">@orklah</a> added support for adding <code>int|string</code> phpdoc standin for <code>array-key</code> (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/vimeo/psalm/issues/4645\">#4645</a>)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/orklah\">@orklah</a> added support for adding <code>string</code> phpdoc standin for <code>Foo::class</code> (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/vimeo/psalm/issues/4651\">#4651</a>)</li>\n<li>use union types in PHP 8 wherever possible (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/vimeo/psalm/issues/4643\">#4643</a>)</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Taint analysis</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/LukasReschke\">@LukasReschke</a> added flows for many common PHP functions (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/vimeo/psalm/issues/4591\">#4591</a>, <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/vimeo/psalm/issues/4659\">#4659</a>)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/LukasReschke\">@LukasReschke</a> added taint propagation for variadics (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/vimeo/psalm/issues/4649\">#4649</a>)</li>\n<li>it's now possible to set up conditional tainting based on a function's parameters (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/vimeo/psalm/issues/4661\">#4661</a>)</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>PHP 8 compatibility</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Promoted properties are always treated as initialised (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/vimeo/psalm/issues/4615\">#4615</a>)</li>\n<li>Flag invalid attribute arguments (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/vimeo/psalm/issues/4611\">#4611</a>)</li>\n<li>Ensure classes used as attributes themselves have the <code>Attribute</code> attribute (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/vimeo/psalm/issues/4475\">#4475</a>)</li>\n<li>Ensure the <code>Attribute</code> attribute is only valid on classes (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/vimeo/psalm/issues/4609\">#4609</a>)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/orklah\">@orklah</a> fixed param names on core functions to enable named-argument calling in PHP 8 (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/vimeo/psalm/issues/4745\">#4745</a>)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/orklah\">@orklah</a> fixed return type additions when returning from <code>finally</code> (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/vimeo/psalm/issues/4746\">#4746</a>)</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Miscellaneous</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Allow the Phar to run in PHP 7.2 (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/vimeo/psalm/issues/4640\">#4640</a>)</li>\n<li>Prevent crash with recursively-defined <code>@psalm-type</code> in root namespace (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/vimeo/psalm/issues/4653\">#4653</a>)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/staabm\">@staabm</a> made many file-based functions impure  (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/vimeo/psalm/issues/4674\">#4674</a>, <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/vimeo/psalm/issues/4676\">#4676</a>, <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/vimeo/psalm/issues/4679\">#4679</a>, <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/vimeo/psalm/issues/4678\">#4678</a>)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/erikjwaxx\">@erikjwaxx</a> narrowed the return type for <code>$a &lt;=&gt;
