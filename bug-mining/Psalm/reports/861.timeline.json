immutable classes with `@psalm-immutable` like in https://psalm.dev/r/257706575b is a great feature, but after adding these annotations to many of my classes I was wondering if Psalm would not be able to automatically detect and imply at least `@psalm-mutation-free` for simple getter methods, like in https://psalm.dev/r/ef463a24c5:\r\n\r\n```php\r\nclass Number\r\n{\r\n    private ?int $validTill = null;\r\n    \r\n    public function __construct(?int $validTill)\r\n    {\r\n        $this->validTill = $validTill;\r\n    }\r\n    \r\n    /** @psalm-mutation-free */\r\n    public function getValidTill(): ?int\r\n    {\r\n        return $this->validTill;\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\n$number = new Number(5);\r\n\r\nif ($number->getValidTill() !== null) {\r\n    echo \\date('Y-m-d H:i:s', $number->getValidTill());\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWith `@psalm-mutation-free` Psalm correctly identifies that between the first `$number->getValidTill()` and the second `$number->getValidTill()` the value could not have changed, but as soon as I remove that annotation (see https://psalm.dev/r/90e677d9cb) Psalm thinks a change might have been possible, even though the method only returns the value of a property. Because a getter and returning a class property is such a common pattern it might be helpful for Psalm to add `@psalm-mutation-free` automatically to methods such as these, as this would improve the accuracy for Psalm in general and fewer explicit annotations would be necessary.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vimeo/psalm/issues/4034/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vimeo/psalm/issues/4034/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":3682866790,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDM2ODI4NjY3OTA=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vimeo/psalm/issues/events/3682866790","actor":{"login":"muglug","id":2292638,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyOTI2Mzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2292638?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug","html_url":"https://github.com/muglug","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"67f9adb33c42d27037a4aefc5d1329fd45ff176d","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vimeo/psalm/commits/67f9adb33c42d27037a4aefc5d1329fd45ff176d","created_at":"2020-08-23T14:28:33Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3687583426,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MzY4NzU4MzQyNg==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vimeo/psalm/issues/events/3687583426","actor":{"login":"muglug","id":2292638,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyOTI2Mzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2292638?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug","html_url":"https://github.com/muglug","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":"4e10a0ed6f4673ea568b603c923395a09eb266ea","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vimeo/psalm/commits/4e10a0ed6f4673ea568b603c923395a09eb266ea","created_at":"2020-08-24T23:29:06Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"actor":{"login":"snapshotpl","id":312655,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxMjY1NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/312655?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/snapshotpl","html_url":"https://github.com/snapshotpl","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/snapshotpl/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/snapshotpl/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/snapshotpl/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/snapshotpl/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/snapshotpl/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/snapshotpl/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/snapshotpl/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/snapshotpl/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/snapshotpl/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-09-02T14:23:40Z","updated_at":"2020-09-02T14:23:40Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vimeo/psalm/issues/4112","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vimeo/psalm","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vimeo/psalm/issues/4112/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vimeo/psalm/issues/4112/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vimeo/psalm/issues/4112/events","html_url":"https://github.com/vimeo/psalm/issues/4112","id":691066170,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU2OTEwNjYxNzA=","number":4112,"title":"Breaks
