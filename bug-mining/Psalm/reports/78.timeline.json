discussed briefly with @sebastianbergmann, adding a few type declarations to the codebase.\r\n\r\nThe final aim (not sure if fully to be reached in this PR) is to:\r\n\r\n * [x] identify redundant assertions - `self::assertTrue(true);` should likely become some sort of type check error ~~out of current patch scope~~\r\n * [x] identify impossible type errors, such as `if (! $a instanceof B) { self::fail(); } typeMismatch($a /* requires B */);`\r\n * [x] allow type-checking `MockObject` instances wherever an explicit class name is given\r\n * [x] make the build green\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n * [x] Prophecy is not yet covered - patches need to be applied upstream in order to make a `Prophecy` instance templated\r\n * [x] I don't yet have a strategy for testing that the added type checks do detect (or not) type errors: thinking of using `.phpt` files\r\n\r\nUpstream issues currently causing false positives here:\r\n\r\n * [x] https://github.com/vimeo/psalm/issues/1692\r\n * [x] https://github.com/vimeo/psalm/issues/1691 (won't fix - let's drop trait types from the patch)\r\n * [x] https://github.com/vimeo/psalm/issues/1743 ~~avoided via different test design~~\r\n * [x]
