some code I wrote that 2 errors would show up no matter what I did, LessSpecificReturnStatement and MoreSpecificReturnType, so I noticed that psalm doesn't know when a list contains for certain only strings. \r\nHere's some example code that shows the issue https://psalm.dev/r/657911d214\r\n\r\n```\r\n$metadata['tags'] = array_filter($metadata['tags'], fn($tag) => is_string($tag));\r\n```\r\n\r\nensures without any doubt that $metadata['tags'] only contains strings.\r\n\r\nWhat's interesting is that\r\n\r\n```\r\n$metadata['tags'] = array_map((fn($tag) => (string) $tag), $metadata['tags']);\r\n```\r\nworks.
