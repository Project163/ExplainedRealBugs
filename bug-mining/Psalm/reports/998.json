13b83e6 (confirmed with bisect) broke the following use case (in doctrine plugin):\r\n\r\n```php\r\n<?php\r\n//

getReference($entityName, $id)\r\n    {\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n```gherkin\r\n  @EntityManager::getReference\r\n  Scenario: Getting a reference\r\n    Given I have the following code\r\n      \"\"\"\r\n      <?php\r\n      use Doctrine\\ORM\\EntityRepository;\r\n      use Doctrine\\ORM\\EntityManager;\r\n      interface I {}\r\n      /**\r\n       * @psalm-suppress InvalidReturnType\r\n

reporting the return type of `getReference()` as `I|null` Psalm now infers it as `I&(T:fn-doctrine\\orm\\entitymanagerinterface::getreference as object)|null` which doesn't make sense in the outer scope.\r\n\r\nApparently this affects stubs only, as I haven't been able to reproduce it on psalm.dev (futile attempt is here:
