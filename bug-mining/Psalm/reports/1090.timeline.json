much a work in progress, comments welcome.\r\nFix for #5371\r\n\r\nI would like to have property invariance checks work correctly, but for now I'll at least settle for disabling them for properties containing a template.\r\n\r\nSo far I've changed `Union::hasTemplate` to check for arrays, lists, class-string-maps, and iterables containing templates, and the tests all pass. If this is the desired behavior of `hasTemplate` there's also `TGenericObject`, and possibly `TCallable` and others I haven't considered yet.\r\n\r\nAny advice is much appreciated. I'm also trying to figure out how to update ClassAnalyzer.php:708 to check if `$guide_property_storage` has a template that's used by `$property_storage`, and then maybe clone `$guide_property_storage` and set the template to what `$property_storage` has before doing the `->equals` check, but I bet there's a better way to do that, cloning doesn't sound great for performance.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vimeo/psalm/issues/5380/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vimeo/psalm/issues/5380/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"actor":{"login":"weirdan","id":57403,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3NDAz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/57403?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/weirdan","html_url":"https://github.com/weirdan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weirdan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weirdan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weirdan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weirdan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weirdan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weirdan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weirdan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weirdan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weirdan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-03-14T22:14:45Z","updated_at":"2021-03-14T22:14:45Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vimeo/psalm/issues/5387","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vimeo/psalm","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vimeo/psalm/issues/5387/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vimeo/psalm/issues/5387/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vimeo/psalm/issues/5387/events","html_url":"https://github.com/vimeo/psalm/issues/5387","id":831270008,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU4MzEyNzAwMDg=","number":5387,"title":"NonInvariantDocblockPropertyType
