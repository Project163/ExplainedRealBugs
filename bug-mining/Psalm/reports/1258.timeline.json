#9997\r\nTypes dynamic property access on `SimpleXmlElement` to `SimpleXmlElement|null`.\r\n\r\nBC impact:\r\n`SimpleXmlElement` is not considered an universal object crate anymore. Therefore things like `$xmlElement->myExtraStringData = 'fooBar';` will not work anymore when this get merged.\r\n\r\nI do not know why this code was in place and I am not sure if my changes are 'legit': https://github.com/vimeo/psalm/pull/10049/files#diff-a3219413916e4af22971b07d3ef169950d3b17b7cf58f48366c408b1d49ade5bR326\r\nI looked through Atomic.php and some other file and it seemed like null checks (in most places) are done by checking `$atomic instanceof TNull` and not considering `TNamedObject('null')` as `null`. Thats why I removed the code...\r\n\r\n\r\nExtra info copied from commit message\r\n- make SimpleXmlElement and SimpleXmlIterator not a universal object crate\r\n- added typed magic __get method to SimpleXmlElement\r\n- adjusted tests to reflect new behaviour of SimpleXmlElement\r\n- added tests\r\n- 'fixed' code translating `null` to `TNamedObject('null')` instead of `TNull`","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vimeo/psalm/issues/10049/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vimeo/psalm/issues/10049/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":10015346314,"node_id":"REFE_lADOBG8K985qpR6fzwAAAAJU9g6K","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vimeo/psalm/issues/events/10015346314","actor":{"login":"ygottschalk","id":18677122,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4Njc3MTIy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18677122?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ygottschalk","html_url":"https://github.com/ygottschalk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ygottschalk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ygottschalk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ygottschalk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ygottschalk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ygottschalk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ygottschalk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ygottschalk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ygottschalk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ygottschalk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"33db549df224f9f62958de279c29f74fa95cb24e","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ygottschalk/psalm/commits/33db549df224f9f62958de279c29f74fa95cb24e","created_at":"2023-08-05T13:40:40Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":10015385356,"node_id":"REFE_lADOBG8K985qpR6fzwAAAAJU9qcM","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vimeo/psalm/issues/events/10015385356","actor":{"login":"ygottschalk","id":18677122,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4Njc3MTIy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18677122?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ygottschalk","html_url":"https://github.com/ygottschalk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ygottschalk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ygottschalk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ygottschalk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ygottschalk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ygottschalk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ygottschalk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ygottschalk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ygottschalk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ygottschalk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"9b77760ab7f8356d519b2b19af986a28543c70ae","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ygottschalk/psalm/commits/9b77760ab7f8356d519b2b19af986a28543c70ae","created_at":"2023-08-05T13:59:32Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":10015500228,"node_id":"REFE_lADOBG8K985qpR6fzwAAAAJU-GfE","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vimeo/psalm/issues/events/10015500228","actor":{"login":"ygottschalk","id":18677122,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4Njc3MTIy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18677122?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ygottschalk","html_url":"https://github.com/ygottschalk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ygottschalk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ygottschalk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ygottschalk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ygottschalk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ygottschalk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ygottschalk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ygottschalk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ygottschalk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ygottschalk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"a4de6d9dc092d77871b6097af42498a192362e9a","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ygottschalk/psalm/commits/a4de6d9dc092d77871b6097af42498a192362e9a","created_at":"2023-08-05T15:07:17Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":10016246078,"node_id":"CE_lADOBG8K985qpR6fzwAAAAJVA8k-","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vimeo/psalm/issues/events/10016246078","actor":{"login":"orklah","id":9605520,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk2MDU1MjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9605520?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/orklah","html_url":"https://github.com/orklah","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/orklah/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/orklah/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"
