I noticed that this sometimes leads to false positives when using an `isset()` check for a key within an array, while Psalm does not find issues on the equivalent version with a `!` instead of `=== false`.\r\n\r\nOne that I've been able to reproduce in isolation:\r\n* https://psalm.dev/r/6ae508f44e (with `isset(...) === false`, gives issues)\r\n* https://psalm.dev/r/5681b1b89c (with `!isset(...)`, no issues)\r\n\r\nI also see some `RedundantPropertyInitializationCheck` issues on `if (isset($this->array[$key]) === false)` patterns on our code base (like Psalm does not understand that we're checking if a specific element is set rather than if the whole array is initialized), which disappear when I switch `=== false` to `!`. I haven't been able to reproduce these in an isolated case though, and hope these maybe also disappear if the above false positive is solved.","closed_by":{"login":"orklah","id":9605520,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk2MDU1MjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9605520?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/orklah","html_url":"https://github.com/orklah","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/orklah/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/orklah/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/orklah/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/orklah/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/orklah/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/orklah/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/orklah/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/orklah/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/orklah/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vimeo/psalm/issues/8084/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vimeo/psalm/issues/8084/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
