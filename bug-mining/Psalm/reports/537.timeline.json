Scenario\r\nI am currently fiddling around a bit with [ubuntu for windows](https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/tutorial-ubuntu-on-windows#1-overview) and I thought psalm would be a great project to work on with this. I installed all composer packages and required PHP extensions and even the suggested `ext-igbinary`.\r\n\r\nIt took me a few days to realize that this was not the issue, but the fact that I checked out psalm with PHPStorm on windows and was using it in the ubuntu command line. This lead to the line breaks in the code being CRLF (aka `\\r\\n`) instead of only LF (aka `\\n`).\r\n\r\nTo help debug this I created some examples ( ⚠️ careful, they only break if your linebreaks are CRLF, which is obviously not shown in the code below):\r\n\r\n### How to reproduce\r\ncode:\r\n```php\r\n<?php\r\n\r\nnamespace Some\\Weird\\Space;\r\n\r\n\r\nclass A {\r\n    /**\r\n     * @param string|null $bla\r\n     * @return array{\r\n     *          0: \\Some\\Weird\\Space\\A|null,\r\n     *          1: null\r\n     *          }\r\n     */\r\n    public function doSomething($bla): array\r\n    {\r\n        echo '1' . (string)$bla;\r\n        return [null, null];\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\n$bla = new A();\r\n$bla->doSomething('2');\r\n```\r\n\r\noutput:\r\n```\r\nScanning files...\r\nAnalyzing files...\r\n\r\nE\r\n\r\n' in docblock for Some\\Weird\\Space\\A::doSomething type 'Some\\Weird\\Space\\null\r\n    /**\r\n     * @param string|null $bla\r\n     * @return array{\r\n     *          0: \\Some\\Weird\\Space\\A|null,\r\n     *          1: null\r\n     *          }\r\n     */\r\n    public function doSomething($bla): array\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------------\r\n1 errors found\r\n------------------------------\r\n\r\nChecks took 1.40 seconds and used 117.811MB of memory\r\nPsalm was able to infer types for 100% of the codebase\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Expected output\r\njust leaving this here as a reference for the full bug report, and it works fine if the linebreaks are LF only:\r\n```\r\nScanning files...\r\nAnalyzing files...\r\n\r\n░\r\n\r\n------------------------------\r\nNo errors found!\r\n------------------------------\r\n\r\nChecks took 1.41 seconds and used 117.818MB of memory\r\nPsalm was able to infer types for 100% of the codebase\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Remarks\r\nMy guess is that this has something to do with the tokenization going wrong and I have it in the back of my mind that there was some piece of code that I stumbled upon during debugging that was just searching for `\\n` and nothing else, which sounds like it could have to do with it, but I could not find it again yet.\r\n\r\nThat being said, my debugging efforts only led to this guess so far and I can not really put my finger on it as you can probably tell.\r\n\r\nGiven that nobody else seems to have stumbled upon this so far I wonder if it is even relevant, but if so, I would be happy to dig deeper and find a solution - just let me know! Thanks!\r\n\r\n**P.S.:** I almost forgot to add. I was not looking for that problem but when I run `./psalm` on master in this configuration, it throws over 400 errors because of this problem.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vimeo/psalm/issues/2953/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vimeo/psalm/issues/2953/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
