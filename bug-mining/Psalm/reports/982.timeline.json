     Q       |   A\r\n|------------- | -----------\r\n| Type         | improvement\r\n| BC Break     | no\r\n\r\nThis pull request documents the shape of the connection parameters array and addresses some issues discovered by the static analysis. It also enforces documentation of the newly added parameters (I hope it's not going to happen) and identifies a certain potential for improvement:\r\n\r\n1. Parameters currently is a mess of DBAL-level (host, port), wrapper-level (primary/replica, sharding), and driver-level (charset, memory) elements.\r\n2. There's no way to tell whether a given parameter is currently used or not (e.g. due to a typo or being driver/wrapper-specific).\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n1. The `OverrideParams` type is added temporarily until Psalm implements the support for self-referencing types (https://github.com/vimeo/psalm/issues/4653#issuecomment-731768265).\r\n2. PHPStan currently interprets `@psalm-*` annotations but doesn't understand user-defined types. Therefore, each added annotation has to be doubled with a `@phpstan-` one with a simpler type.\r\n3.
