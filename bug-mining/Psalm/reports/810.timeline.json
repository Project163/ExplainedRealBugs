ok, this currently breaks down because Psalm converts switch calls to roughly-equivalent if statements:\r\n\r\n```php\r\nif (foo() == 1) {\r\n} elseif (foo() == 2)) {\r\n} elseif (foo() == 3) {\r\n} else {}\r\n```\r\n\r\nwhich obviously doesn't have the same guarantees.\r\n\r\nThe solution would be to swap the function call for a `$__tmp_switch_var_<file_offset>` variable fetch, allowing proper
