in #3081 https://github.com/vimeo/psalm/commit/26fcde10fa937bb84896bc37ccf653b2f4c162db\r\n\r\nPHP docs says:\r\n> _ownerDocument_\r\n> The DOMDocument object associated with this node, or null if this node is a DOMDocument\r\n\r\nhttps://www.php.net/manual/en/class.domnode.php#domnode.props.ownerdocument\r\n\r\nAnd actually PHP enforces this contract:\r\nhttps://3v4l.org/tWoCc\r\n\r\nPHP 8.1+ throws DOMException about object broken state if DOMNode doesn't have an onwerDocument, so it can't be null.\r\nPHP 8.1- allows get null from this field, but it throws a warning about object broken state. While it's possible to add this behavior change in CallMap_81_delta, I believe that manipulating an object with broken state should be discouraged, and Psalm shouldn't cover this edge case.\r\n\r\nProbably it should be forbidden to call DOMNode and its children constructor directly—except for DOMDocument—to prevent creating dom object with broken state. Marking those with `@internal` would be the easiest solution, but it could be better to show custom issue message like \"using DOMNode and its children constructor directly results in broken object's internal state, use corresponding DOMDocument::create* method instead\". \r\nI'm not sure how it could be right to reinforce this check, so if somebody gives me a hint, I'm ready to make a PR

in 2020 to resolve issue #3081 a change was made to incorporate the fact that `DOMNode::ownerDocument` can be null. This was effectively reverted with PR #10619.\r\n\r\nThis reverting change is technically wrong and not following the actual implementation in PHP.\r\n\r\nThe example linked in the PR (https://3v4l.org/tWoCc) about PHP enforcing the non-nullable type is misleading/incorrect, as a modified, even simpler, example demonstrates: https://3v4l.org/fGc7t\r\n\r\nIn other words: The `ownerDocument`-Property can very much (still) be null. Whether or not this is a desirable behavior is a different story.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vimeo/psalm/issues/10877/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vimeo/psalm/issues/10877/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
