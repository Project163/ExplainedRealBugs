The join method simply takes an iterable of iterables and joins them together into one iterable, very similar to array_merge.\r\n\r\ne.g.\r\n```\r\njoin([1,2,3], [4,5,6]) == [1,2,3,4,5,6]\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt seems as though, when I typehint with the splat syntax for the varargs, the resulting iterable from join doesn't maintain the inner type of T, and defaults to mixed as shown in the MixedAssignment warning.\r\n\r\nHowever, when I don't use the varargs and just accept an array, the inner type is maintained.\r\n\r\nI've read the docs a few times and didn't see any examples that could guide me through and already have checked the open/closed Github issues and didn't seem to find anyone else stumbling on my specific issue.\r\n\r\nI apologize in advance if this is just me not understanding the proper docblock syntax :(.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"muglug","id":2292638,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyOTI2Mzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2292638?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug","html_url":"https://github.com/muglug","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/muglug/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vimeo/psalm/issues/2824/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vimeo/psalm/issues/2824/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
