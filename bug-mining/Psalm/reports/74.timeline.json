#463\r\n\r\nThis is an incomplete patch that just serves to display that types can be\r\nimproved massively in here, making even this magic contraption of a library\r\nusable downstream with some decent type constraints.\r\n\r\nTODOs:\r\n\r\n - [x] need to implement CI steps to ensure type inference works as expected\r\n - [x] full type coverage in ProxyManager internals (note: no tests yet - those require more work)\r\n - [x] pin to stable `vimeo/psalm` (`^3.4.0`)\r\n - [x] split type check test file into multiple type-checked examples\r\n - [x] raise psalm reporting levels\r\n - [x] add
