Running the default task causes the error, while running either one individually done not. I'm on OSX which means my open file limit is 256. I feel the gulp core should handle this more gracefully, but I'm not sure the correct approach. I'll fork and see if I can make a contribution, unless someone already has grips on this.  \n\nOverall, I'm very impressed with the speed and _love_ the idea of code over configuration.
