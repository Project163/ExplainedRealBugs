However, the implementation is weird. It is better to use the `ignore` option to set a pattern or set of patterns to exclude from matches.\n\nHowever, as indicated in issue #1176, `ignore` does not work in gulp. Something is broken: the docs, the implementation, or both. Step one is to determine the desired state. Step two is to update the docs and/or code.
