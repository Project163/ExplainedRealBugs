Issue details\n\nI'm setting up a new project and I have the following gulpfule.js setup:\n\n``` js\nvar gulp        = require('gulp');\nvar browserSync = require('browser-sync');\nvar sass        =

'_site/assets/images';\n\n// Browser Sync\ngulp.task('serve', ['sass', 'pug', 'images', 'compress'], function() {\n  browserSync.init({\n    server: {\n      baseDir: '_site/'\n    },\n    notify:

.pipe(gulp.dest(imgDest));\n});\n\ngulp.task('default', ['serve']);\n```\n\nWhat I'm seeing when I run it is if I make a change to my 'index.pug' (formerly Jade) file and save, I see in my terminal that it attempts to reload the browser, but it just hangs there. \n\nSpecifically, I see this: \n\n```\n ------------------------------------\n       Local: http://localhost:3000\n    External: http://192.168.1.8:3000\n ------------------------------------\n          UI: http://localhost:3001\n UI External: http://192.168.1.8:3001\n ------------------------------------\n[BS] Serving files from: _site/\n[22:15:18] Starting 'pug'...\n[22:15:18] Finished 'pug' after 8.8 ms\n[BS] Reloading Browsers...\n```\n\nAny help on this would be greatly appreciated.\n\nThank you\n### Steps to
