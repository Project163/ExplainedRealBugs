have an interest in using gulp as a library and/or combining the functionality of multiple gulpfiles.  My reasons are twofold:\n\n1) I want to coordinate with another non-Node process\n2) I want to have two gulpfiles that specialize in building a browser app and a Node app, respectively.  I want them to be functional as standalone gulpfiles and as an integrated set.\n\nFor #1, I've thought about \"requiring in\" the `/bin/gulp.js` module.  I guess if I put gulp into a watch state from the default task, this sets me up to be able to poke it to run tasks by requiring the /index.js (main gulp module) in order to run tasks via gulp.start.  Does this make sense?  Could it be any easier?\n\nFor #2, I'm thinking that if I factor-out the majority of my 2 gulpfiles into separate modules, that I could reasonably combine them when the two halves of the solution (browser and server) are being built together by requiring them in to a higher-level gulpfile.  The major issue I see here is collision with task names, but I would imagine I can work around that?\n\nDoes anyone have any thoughts on feasibility, alternatives or simple changes I might put in as a PR that would make this easier?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/gulpjs/gulp/issues/400/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/gulpjs/gulp/issues/400/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"actor":{"login":"yocontra","id":425716,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyNTcxNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/425716?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yocontra","html_url":"https://github.com/yocontra","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yocontra/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yocontra/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yocontra/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yocontra/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yocontra/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yocontra/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yocontra/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yocontra/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yocontra/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-08-27T21:39:49Z","updated_at":"2014-08-27T21:39:49Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/gulpjs/gulp/issues/640","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/gulpjs/gulp","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/gulpjs/gulp/issues/640/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/gulpjs/gulp/issues/640/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/gulpjs/gulp/issues/640/events","html_url":"https://github.com/gulpjs/gulp/issues/640","id":41310308,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU0MTMxMDMwOA==","number":640,"title":"zsh
