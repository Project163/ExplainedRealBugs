I think this is because file.shortened and file.base are different. That causes problems in createOutputStream.js.\n\nExample:\n\nIf you use the glob *.js:\n\n``` javascript\ngulp.src(\"*.js\")\n.pipe(gulp.dest(\"./output\"));\n```\n\nThe piped file looks like this:\n\n```\n{ shortened: 'test.js',\n  base: '.',\n  path: 'test.js',\n  contents: <Buffer 54 45 53 54 0a 54 45 53 54 0a 54 45 53 54 0a 54 45 53 54> }\n```\n\nBut if you use the exact file name:\n\n``` javascript\ngulp.src(\"test.js\")\n.pipe(gulp.dest(\"./output\"));\n```\n\nThe piped file looks like this:\n\n```\n{shortened: '',\n  base: 'test.js',\n  path: 'test.js',\n  contents: <Buffer 54 45 53 54 0a 54 45 53 54 0a 54 45 53 54 0a 54 45 53 54> }\n```\n","closed_by":{"login":"yocontra","id":425716,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyNTcxNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/425716?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yocontra","html_url":"https://github.com/yocontra","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yocontra/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yocontra/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yocontra/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yocontra/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yocontra/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yocontra/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yocontra/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yocontra/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yocontra/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/gulpjs/gulp/issues/15/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/gulpjs/gulp/issues/15/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
