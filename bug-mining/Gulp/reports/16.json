Obvisouly, the point of this is that gulp is the best build tool for the web tier and yet gradle is already doing build stuff and 'watch-like' behavior.\n\nThere is a trick, though.  I have to read the streams coming out of the node process and write them through the java process to the console.  And node detects my reader isn't a tty and therefore chalk doesn't emit color coded text.\n\nI've managed to wrangle it.  **Would be nice if it (forcing colors to be used) was somehow supported in the next version of the gulp's log support.  That's my feature request.**\n\nHere's my solution, which hopefully bears no resemblance to how this would be supported in future gulp loggers.   I create seperate module, runGulp.js:\n\n``` javascript\n'use strict';\n\n// does the caller want to force color coding?\nvar forceColor = require('minimist')(process.argv.slice(2))['force-color'];\n\nif (forceColor) {\n  var chalk = require('chalk');\n  // force color coding if requested\n  chalk.enabled = chalk.enabled || true;\n\n\n  // force color coding on plugins\n  var pkg = require('./package.json');\n  var sections = ['dependencies', 'peerDependencies', 'devDependencies'];\n  var pattern = /^gulp-.+$/;\n\n  // loop the sections of the package.json looking for gulp- plugins\n  sections.forEach(function(section) {\n    var sec = pkg[section];\n    if (sec) {\n      Object.keys(sec).forEach(function(dep) {\n        if (pattern.test(dep)) {\n          // if it's a gulp plugin and it has a gulp-util dependency,\n          // match color support to overall chalk setting\n          try {\n            var colors = require(dep + '/node_modules/gulp-util').colors;\n            colors.enabled = true;\n          }\n          catch (err) {}\n        }\n      });\n    }\n  });\n}\n\n// run the gulp client as if we were never here... :)\nrequire('gulp/bin/gulp');\n```\n\nThen I invoke it with `node runGulp` from gradle.\n","closed_by":{"login":"yocontra","id":425716,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyNTcxNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/425716?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yocontra","html_url":"https://github.com/yocontra","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yocontra/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yocontra/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yocontra/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yocontra/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yocontra/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yocontra/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yocontra/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yocontra/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yocontra/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/gulpjs/gulp/issues/385/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/gulpjs/gulp/issues/385/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
