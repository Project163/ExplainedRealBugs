Everything must use these now.</li>\n<li>added single argument syntax for <code>gulp.task</code> which allows a named function to be used as the name of the task and task function.</li>\n<li>added <code>gulp.tree</code> method for retrieving the task tree.

Everything must use these now.</li>\n<li>added single argument syntax for <code>gulp.task</code> which allows a named function to be used as the name of the task and task function.</li>\n<li>added <code>gulp.tree</code> method for retrieving the task tree. Pass <code>{ deep: true }</code> for an <code>archy</code> compatible node list.</li>\n<li>added <code>gulp.registry</code> for setting custom registries.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>CLI changes</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>split CLI out into a module if you want to save bandwidth/disk space. you can install the gulp CLI using either <code>npm install gulp -g</code> or <code>npm install gulp-cli -g</code>, where gulp-cli is the smaller one (no module code included)</li>\n<li>add <code>--tasks-json</code> flag to CLI to dump the whole tree out for other tools to consume</li>\n<li>added <code>--verify</code> flag to check the dependencies in package.json against the plugin blacklist.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>vinyl/vinyl-fs changes</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>added <code>gulp.symlink</code> which functions exactly like <code>gulp.dest</code>, but symlinks instead.</li>\n<li>added <code>dirMode</code> param to <code>gulp.dest</code> and <code>gulp.symlink</code> which allows better control over the mode of the destination folder that is created.</li>\n<li>globs passed to <code>gulp.src</code> will be evaluated in order, which means this is possible <code>gulp.src(['*.js', '!b*.js', 'bad.js'])</code> (exclude every JS file that starts with a b except bad.js)</li>\n<li>performance for gulp.src has improved massively\n<ul>\n<li><code>gulp.src(['**/*', '!b.js'])</code> will no longer eat CPU since negations happen during walking now</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>added <code>since</code> option to <code>gulp.src</code> which lets you only match files that have been modified since a certain date (for incremental builds)</li>\n<li>fixed <code>gulp.src</code> not following symlinks</li>\n<li>added <code>overwrite</code> option to <code>gulp.dest</code> which allows you to enable or disable overwriting of existing files</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n</details>\n<details>\n<summary>Commits</summary>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/gulpjs/gulp/commit/069350a5febf65adc27bc816a7805471b7d96f03\"><code>069350a</code></a> Release: 4.0.2</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/gulpjs/gulp/commit/b4b5a68373b4c58d6b92321cea64a6ffcc3ff042\"><code>b4b5a68</code></a> Build: Add node 12 to Travis &amp; Azure</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/gulpjs/gulp/commit/5667666ffae15c169f99c7096ca59c05f9440272\"><code>5667666</code></a> Fix: Bind src/dest/symlink to the gulp instance to support esm exports (ref s...</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/gulpjs/gulp/commit/4091bd3aff08801625c6128eec079af4a7b5dccb\"><code>4091bd3</code></a> Docs: Add notes about esm support (closes <a href=\"https://github.com/gulpjs/gulp/issues/2278\">#2278</a>)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/gulpjs/gulp/commit/3c66d95f014b99f79e0375c43cfa17a7269732a2\"><code>3c66d95</code></a> Docs: Fix the Negative Globs section &amp; examples (closes <a href=\"https://github.com/gulpjs/gulp/issues/2297\">#2297</a>)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/gulpjs/gulp/commit/1693a1127116a6804a892a4b931c232b1bec9162\"><code>1693a11</code></a> Docs: Remove next tag from recipes (closes <a href=\"https://github.com/gulpjs/gulp/issues/2277\">#2277</a>)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/gulpjs/gulp/commit/d9162761f276fce5fe54bc0a60c7eb9efcd5e249\"><code>d916276</code></a> Docs: Add default task wrappers to Watching Files examples to make runnable (...</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/gulpjs/gulp/commit/ea52a927843ff0e84f142f85813572bd5144a656\"><code>ea52a92</code></a> Docs: Fix syntax error in lastRun API docs (closes <a href=\"https://github.com/gulpjs/gulp/issues/2315\">#2315</a>)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/gulpjs/gulp/commit/5d81f42f9ddc4aa0a0721057eff8b8e24b65861c\"><code>5d81f42</code></a> Docs: Fix typo in Explaining Globs (<a href=\"https://github.com/gulpjs/gulp/issues/2326\">#2326</a>)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/gulpjs/gulp/commit/ea3bba4fdf9f2b508699f69569d0191b8c5bc10c\"><code>ea3bba4</code></a> Release: 4.0.1</li>\n<li>Additional commits viewable in <a href=\"https://github.com/gulpjs/gulp/compare/v3.9.1...v4.0.2\">compare view</a></li>\n</ul>\n</details>\n<br />\n\n\n[![Dependabot compatibility score](https://dependabot-badges.githubapp.com/badges/compatibility_score?dependency-name=gulp&package-manager=npm_and_yarn&previous-version=3.9.1&new-version=4.0.2)](https://docs.github.com/en/github/managing-security-vulnerabilities/about-dependabot-security-updates#about-compatibility-scores)\n\nDependabot will resolve any conflicts with this PR as long as you don't alter it yourself.

Everything must use these now.</li>\n<li>added single argument syntax for <code>gulp.task</code> which allows a named function to be used as the name of the task and task function.</li>\n<li>added <code>gulp.tree</code> method for retrieving the task tree. Pass <code>{ deep: true }</code> for an <code>archy</code> compatible node list.</li>\n<li>added <code>gulp.registry</code> for setting custom registries.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>CLI changes</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>split CLI out into a module if you want to save bandwidth/disk space. you can install the gulp CLI using either <code>npm install gulp -g</code> or <code>npm install gulp-cli -g</code>, where gulp-cli is the smaller one (no module code included)</li>\n<li>add <code>--tasks-json</code> flag to CLI to dump the whole tree out for other tools to consume</li>\n<li>added <code>--verify</code> flag to check the dependencies in package.json against the plugin blacklist.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>vinyl/vinyl-fs changes</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>added <code>gulp.symlink</code> which functions exactly like <code>gulp.dest</code>, but symlinks instead.</li>\n<li>added <code>dirMode</code> param to <code>gulp.dest</code> and <code>gulp.symlink</code> which allows better control over the mode of the destination folder that is created.</li>\n<li>globs passed to <code>gulp.src</code> will be evaluated in order, which means this is possible <code>gulp.src(['*.js', '!b*.js', 'bad.js'])</code> (exclude every JS file that starts with a b except bad.js)</li>\n<li>performance for gulp.src has improved massively\n<ul>\n<li><code>gulp.src(['**/*', '!b.js'])</code> will no longer eat CPU since negations happen during walking now</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>added <code>since</code> option to <code>gulp.src</code> which lets you only match files that have been modified since a certain date (for incremental builds)</li>\n<li>fixed <code>gulp.src</code> not following symlinks</li>\n<li>added <code>overwrite</code> option to <code>gulp.dest</code> which allows you to enable or disable overwriting of existing files</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n</details>\n<details>\n<summary>Commits</summary>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/gulpjs/gulp/commit/069350a5febf65adc27bc816a7805471b7d96f03\"><code>069350a</code></a> Release: 4.0.2</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/gulpjs/gulp/commit/b4b5a68373b4c58d6b92321cea64a6ffcc3ff042\"><code>b4b5a68</code></a> Build: Add node 12 to Travis &amp; Azure</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/gulpjs/gulp/commit/5667666ffae15c169f99c7096ca59c05f9440272\"><code>5667666</code></a> Fix: Bind src/dest/symlink to the gulp instance to support esm exports (ref s...</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/gulpjs/gulp/commit/4091bd3aff08801625c6128eec079af4a7b5dccb\"><code>4091bd3</code></a> Docs: Add notes about esm support (closes <a href=\"https://github.com/gulpjs/gulp/issues/2278\">#2278</a>)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/gulpjs/gulp/commit/3c66d95f014b99f79e0375c43cfa17a7269732a2\"><code>3c66d95</code></a> Docs: Fix the Negative Globs section &amp; examples (closes <a href=\"https://github.com/gulpjs/gulp/issues/2297\">#2297</a>)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/gulpjs/gulp/commit/1693a1127116a6804a892a4b931c232b1bec9162\"><code>1693a11</code></a> Docs: Remove next tag from recipes (closes <a href=\"https://github.com/gulpjs/gulp/issues/2277\">#2277</a>)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/gulpjs/gulp/commit/d9162761f276fce5fe54bc0a60c7eb9efcd5e249\"><code>d916276</code></a> Docs: Add default task wrappers to Watching Files examples to make runnable (...</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/gulpjs/gulp/commit/ea52a927843ff0e84f142f85813572bd5144a656\"><code>ea52a92</code></a> Docs: Fix syntax error in lastRun API docs (closes <a href=\"https://github.com/gulpjs/gulp/issues/2315\">#2315</a>)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/gulpjs/gulp/commit/5d81f42f9ddc4aa0a0721057eff8b8e24b65861c\"><code>5d81f42</code></a> Docs: Fix typo in Explaining Globs (<a href=\"https://github.com/gulpjs/gulp/issues/2326\">#2326</a>)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/gulpjs/gulp/commit/ea3bba4fdf9f2b508699f69569d0191b8c5bc10c\"><code>ea3bba4</code></a> Release: 4.0.1</li>\n<li>Additional commits viewable in <a href=\"https://github.com/gulpjs/gulp/compare/v3.9.1...v4.0.2\">compare view</a></li>\n</ul>\n</details>\n<br />\n\n\n[![Dependabot compatibility score](https://dependabot-badges.githubapp.com/badges/compatibility_score?dependency-name=gulp&package-manager=npm_and_yarn&previous-version=3.9.1&new-version=4.0.2)](https://docs.github.com/en/github/managing-security-vulnerabilities/about-dependabot-security-updates#about-compatibility-scores)\n\nDependabot will resolve any conflicts with this PR as long as you don't alter it yourself.

Everything must use these now.</li>\n<li>added single argument syntax for <code>gulp.task</code> which allows a named function to be used as the name of the task and task function.</li>\n<li>added <code>gulp.tree</code> method for retrieving the task tree.
