Under usage, it provides the following recipe:\r\n```js\r\nconst { src, dest, lastRun, watch } = require('gulp');\r\nconst imagemin = require('gulp-imagemin');\r\n\r\nfunction images() {\r\n  return src('src/images/**/*.jpg', { since: lastRun(images) })\r\n    .pipe(imagemin())\r\n    .pipe(dest('build/img/'));\r\n}\r\n\r\nfunction watch() {\r\n  watch('src/images/**/*.jpg', images);\r\n}\r\n\r\nexports.watch = watch;\r\n```\r\nHowever, running this gives a SyntaxError: `Identifier 'watch' has already been declared`. You can't name the function `watch`, since `watch` is already declared as the gulp command in de destructuring assignment.","closed_by":{"login":"phated","id":992373,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk5MjM3Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/992373?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/phated","html_url":"https://github.com/phated","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phated/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phated/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phated/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phated/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phated/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phated/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phated/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phated/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phated/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/gulpjs/gulp/issues/2315/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/gulpjs/gulp/issues/2315/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
