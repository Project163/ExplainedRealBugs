(and thus get no error exit code on the shell eval for grunt completions)\n\nIn fact, if you try running `gulp --version` outside of a `gulpfile.js` project scope you'll also get the same \"Missing Gulpfile\" error which makes no sense.\n\nThis obviously focuses on getting a correct exit code from the `gulp --completion=zsh` eval but I think a functionality of `gulp --version` outside of any project scope should always work if you install gulp globally.\n","closed_by":{"login":"yocontra","id":425716,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyNTcxNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/425716?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yocontra","html_url":"https://github.com/yocontra","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yocontra/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yocontra/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yocontra/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yocontra/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yocontra/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yocontra/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yocontra/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yocontra/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yocontra/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/gulpjs/gulp/issues/539/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/gulpjs/gulp/issues/539/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
