If you've got any WIP / design docs to share I would definitively have a look.\n\n> Why pass a number to done instead of just passing an error?\n\nThis is due to the fact that some 3rd party libraries are taking callbacks to signal their async processing completion. In this particular case I was bridging Karma-runner with gulp (full repo here:  https://github.com/karma-runner/gulp-karma):\n\n``` javascript\nvar karma = require('karma').server;\n\ngulp.task('test', function (done) {\n  karma.start({}, done);\n});\n```\n\nAs you can see I'm directly passing gulp's `done` callback down to Karma and it is Karma that calls back with the status `1`. Of course I could do:\n\n``` javascript\ngulp.task('test', function (done) {\n  karma.start({}, function(exitStatus){\n    done(exitStatus ? \"There are failing unit tests\" : undefined);\n  });\n});\n```\n\n but yeh, this is more verbose and not really needed as Karma already provides good info about the run status / failed tests.\n\nSo, this is real-life scenario and IMO it wouldn't hurt to handle strings and numbers the same way.
