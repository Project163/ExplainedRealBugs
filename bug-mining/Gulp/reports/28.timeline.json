How would someone submit a documentation PR when no clarification was provided on how the current documentation differs from the expected behavior?\n\nMy understanding is that `gulp.src()` or `glob-stream` special-cases the negated patterns, but since it uses `glob` under the hood I'd rather use `opts.ignore` than negated patterns, as advised by that package.\n\nAlso, there was a bug in `glob` that prevented `opts.ignore` from working in connection with the way `gulp.src()` or `glob-stream` utilizes `glob`: https://github.com/isaacs/node-glob/issues/194. That was fixed relatively recently. I don't know if there's another issue that prevents `opts.ignore` from working through `gulp.src()`, but it's at least worth checking / updating your `glob` dependency to see if that fixes it.\n","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/gulpjs/gulp/issues/comments/144453649/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"jmm","id":129203,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyOTIwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/129203?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmm","html_url":"https://github.com/jmm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/gulpjs/gulp/issues/comments/144458484","html_url":"https://github.com/gulpjs/gulp/issues/1296#issuecomment-144458484","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/gulpjs/gulp/issues/1296","id":144458484,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE0NDQ1ODQ4NA==","user":{"login":"callumacrae","id":472830,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3MjgzMA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/472830?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/callumacrae","html_url":"https://github.com/callumacrae","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/callumacrae/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/callumacrae/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/callumacrae/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/callumacrae/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/callumacrae/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/callumacrae/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/callumacrae/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/callumacrae/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/callumacrae/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-09-30T15:57:53Z","updated_at":"2015-09-30T15:57:53Z","body":"A

\n\n> We do not pass through the ignore option - this is on purpose.\n> AFAIK we pass through everything, but ignore just does nothing because we do our own negation\n\nI think you're saying that the gulp stuff doesn't _set_ an `ignore` option (it implements negation by other means), but does pass it through if the user passed it. Is there some specific reason at this time that passing `ignore` to `gulp.src()` wouldn't be viable? As of a few months ago there was a bug in `glob` that would prevent `ignore` from working in conjunction with the way the gulp stuff utilizes `glob`, but that was supposed to be fixed as of v5.0.13.\n\n> We have always done our own negation for consistency and performance reasons.\n> Will still traverse the node modules folder, but then negate at the vinyl-fs level which is a huge CPU and memory hog.\n\nThese comments are kind of hard to reconcile. The custom negation stuff is better or worse for performance? If `glob`'s `ignore` works is there a performance advantage to the custom gulp negation? Not sure what the consistency issues are.\n","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/gulpjs/gulp/issues/comments/144600225/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"jmm","id":129203,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyOTIwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/129203?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmm","html_url":"https://github.com/jmm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":423790987,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50NDIzNzkwOTg3","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/gulpjs/gulp/issues/events/423790987","actor":{"login":"yocontra","id":425716,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyNTcxNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/425716?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yocontra","html_url":"https://github.com/yocontra","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yocontra/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yocontra/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yocontra/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yocontra/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yocontra/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yocontra/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yocontra/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yocontra/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yocontra/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2015-10-01T02:33:07Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":423790988,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDQyMzc5MDk4OA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/gulpjs/gulp/issues/events/423790988","actor":{"login":"yocontra","id":425716,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyNTcxNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/425716?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yocontra","html_url":"https://github.com/yocontra","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yocontra/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yocontra/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yocontra/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yocontra/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yocontra/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yocontra/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yocontra/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yocontra/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yocontra/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2015-10-01T02:33:07Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/gulpjs/gulp/issues/comments/144600770","html_url":"https://github.com/gulpjs/gulp/issues/1296#issuecomment-144600770","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/gulpjs/gulp/issues/1296","id":144600770,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE0NDYwMDc3MA==","user":{"login":"yocontra","id":425716,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyNTcxNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/425716?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yocontra","html_url":"https://github.com/yocontra","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yocontra/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yocontra/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yocontra/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yocontra/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yocontra/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yocontra/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yocontra/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yocontra/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yocontra/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-10-01T02:39:59Z","updated_at":"2015-10-01T02:39:59Z","body":"@jmm \n- What's your use case for not wanting to put the negations in the array?

In fact negated patterns or ignoring paths are barely even _mentioned_. I see one example of a negated pattern, with no commentary, in the main [README](https://github.com/gulpjs/gulp/blob/master/README.md). I don't see _anything_ about it in the [`gulp.src()` docs](https://github.com/gulpjs/gulp/blob/master/docs/API.md#gulpsrcglobs-options). Realistically, most people aren't going to think there's any reason to look at the glob-stream docs, which in any case still don't explain that negated patterns are special-cased and still say that options are passed through to node-glob.\n  \n  I only discovered that gulp special-cases negated patterns when I noticed that the `ignore` option didn't work. I fully expected it to since the gulp docs say that the options are:\n  \n  > [passed] to node-glob through glob-stream.\n  \n  That's when I discovered https://github.com/isaacs/node-glob/issues/194 and chalked it up to that. \n  \n  Now that I know all of this I'd still prefer to be consistent with the underlying implementation (node-glob) and use `ignore` unless there's an important reason to rely on gulp's special-casing of the negated patterns.\n- > As far as \"not viable\" I don't think the ignore option to the underlying glob module will play well with our stuff, but feel free to try that yourself\n  \n  Yeah I'll plan to give it a shot.\n\n> I guess I'm just confused about this whole series of github threads: Can you clearly explain what the desired outcome of this looks like to you?\n\nWhat series is that, this and #1176? Desired outcome:\n- Find out if `ignore` does or doesn't work and why.\n- Find out if there is or isn't some important reason to rely on gulp's special-casing of negated patterns instead.\n- Make any necessary corrections to the documenation.\n- Don't have the documentation say you can't use `ignore` unless you really can't and shouldn't.\n- Help you understand how the documentation and comments

\n\n> Nowhere in our documentation do we tell people to use the ignore option\n\nThe old documentation effectively did tell people to use `ignore`. When the docs just say \"this module passes options through to module _x_\", you're telling users to freely use all the options of module _x_.\n\nA PR to fix the documentation already exists. What @contra is asking about is whether we should go further. He's asking whether the API decision to not use `ignore` is the right decision. A PR isn't a bad way to answer the question: see if it's practical to implement an API that matches node-glob's.\n\nThe one caveat I'd put out there is that if anyone would be against an `ignore`-based API even if it has a solid implementation behind it, please speak now before @contra invests time into the PR.\n","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/gulpjs/gulp/issues/comments/144993614/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"breyed","id":1299073,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyOTkwNzM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1299073?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/breyed","html_url":"https://github.com/breyed","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/breyed/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/breyed/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/breyed/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/breyed/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/breyed/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/breyed/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/breyed/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/breyed/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/breyed/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":425155865,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50NDI1MTU1ODY1","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/gulpjs/gulp/issues/events/425155865","actor":{"login":"jmm","id":129203,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyOTIwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/129203?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmm","html_url":"https://github.com/jmm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2015-10-02T11:20:47Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":425155866,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDQyNTE1NTg2Ng==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/gulpjs/gulp/issues/events/425155866","actor":{"login":"jmm","id":129203,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyOTIwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/129203?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmm","html_url":"https://github.com/jmm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jmm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2015-10-02T11:20:47Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":425155867,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50NDI1MTU1ODY3","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/gulpjs/gulp/issues/events/425155867","actor":{"login":"yocontra","id":425716,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyNTcxNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/425716?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yocontra","html_url":"https://github.com/yocontra","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yocontra/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yocontra/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yocontra/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yocontra/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yocontra/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yocontra/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yocontra/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yocontra/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yocontra/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2015-10-02T11:20:47Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":425155868,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDQyNTE1NTg2OA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/gulpjs/gulp/issues/events/425155868","actor":{"login":"yocontra","id":425716,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyNTcxNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/425716?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https:
