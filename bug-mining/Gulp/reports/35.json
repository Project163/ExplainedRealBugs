Without subfolders in the src path, `.map` won't run... which means gulp scripts don't fire... leaving us with a null stream. \r\n\r\nIs there any way to return an \"empty\" stream if no folders are present or inform gulp that the task has run successfully in the same instance?","closed_by":{"login":"dave-cross","id":5976379,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5NzYzNzk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5976379?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dave-cross","html_url":"https://github.com/dave-cross","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dave-cross/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dave-cross/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dave-cross/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dave-cross/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dave-cross/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dave-cross/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dave-cross/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dave-cross/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dave-cross/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/gulpjs/gulp/issues/2122/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/gulpjs/gulp/issues/2122/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
