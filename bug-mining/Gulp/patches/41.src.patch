-Since globs are matched in array order, a negative glob must follow at least one non-negative glob in an array. The first finds a set of matches, then the negative glob removes a portion of those results. These are most performant when they only include literal characters.
+Since globs are matched in array order, a negative glob must follow at least one non-negative glob in an array. The first finds a set of matches, then the negative glob removes a portion of those results. When excluding all files within a directory, you must add `/**` after the directory name, which the globbing library optimizes internally.
 
 ```js
-['scripts/**/*.js', '!scripts/vendor/']
+['scripts/**/*.js', '!scripts/vendor/**']
 ```
 
 If any non-negative globs follow a negative, nothing will be removed from the later set of matches.
 
 ```js
-['scripts/**/*.js', '!scripts/vendor/', 'scripts/vendor/react.js']
+['scripts/**/*.js', '!scripts/vendor/**', 'scripts/vendor/react.js']
 ```
 
 Negative globs can be used as an alternative for restricting double-star globs.
 
 ```js
-['**/*.js', '!node_modules/']
+['**/*.js', '!node_modules/**']
 ```
