`RenderTarget` tracking not being notified to update its active target when an FBO `RenderTexture` is `display()`ed.\r\n\r\n0adde249ec9fd2012c53b5f57f71989ffd88d16f introduced FBO `RenderTarget` optimizations that reduced the amount of context switching that had to be performed in certain situations. A tracking map was added to `RenderTarget` that kept track of which `RenderTarget` was active in which context. This bug occurs because if the FBO check is successful, not only was the FBO activation skipped, but the updating of the `RenderTarget` map as well. Performing a partial (`RenderTarget`-only) update fixes this issue.\r\n\r\nThe examples that exhibit broken behaviour can be found in #2630.\r\n\r\nFixes #2630\r\n\r\n@danieljpetersen @Bambo-Borris

Prerequisite Checklist\n\n- [x] I searched for [existing issues](https://github.com/search?q=repo%3ASFML%2FSFML&type=issues) to prevent duplicates\n- [x] I searched for [existing discussions on the forum](https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ahttps%3A%2F%2Fen.sfml-dev.org) to prevent duplicates\n- [x] I am here to report an issue and not to just ask a question or look for help (use the [forum](https://en.sfml-dev.org/forums/index.php#c3) or [Discord](https://discord.gg/nr4X7Fh) instead)\n\n### Describe your issue here\n\n[Original discussion of this bug.](https://discord.com/channels/175298431294636032/175298431294636032/1343265198319992923)\nI also thoroughly discussed the issue with Thrasher (thrashbash) in Discord DMs before creating this issue.\n\nPassing anti-aliasing (through context settings) to render textures causes them not to get drawn after anything else in the window in the provided case (~80 lines).\n\nThe issue doesn't occur when the render textures are created using the default context settings (no anti-aliasing).\n\nThe only workaround solution I managed to find is to both draw the render textures in the window and a throwaway render texture that never gets drawn nor used anywhere (see line 72).\n```cpp\nsf::RenderTexture * throwaway_render_texture = new sf::RenderTexture;\nthrowaway_render_texture->create(1, 1);\nthrowaway_render_texture->draw(*sprite);\ndelete throwaway_render_texture;\n```\n\nThe issue affects both SFML and CSFML.\n\nIf the C++ code looks a bit weird it's because it's been directly translated from C code, thus being written in a C-style manner.\n\nExpected result :\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cf38a907-ed76-42a3-9f74-9f35d106e09f)\n\nBug-induced result (render textures refuse to get drawn after anything's been drawn already)
