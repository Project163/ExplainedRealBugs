tried using sf::TcpSocket recently, and I decided to use the `timeout` argument.\r\nWhen I set it to, let's say `sf::seconds(5)`, and if it fails to connect once, the instance of the socket will no longer try to connect, and always fail.\r\n\r\nSo is this behavior intended or did you just forget to reset timeout state after a connection failed?\r\n\r\nLibrary: SFML 2.4.2-4\r\nOS: ArchLinux
