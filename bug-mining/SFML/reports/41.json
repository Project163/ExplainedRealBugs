commit https://github.com/SFML/SFML/commit/6b71456a55c9cce3eae12ee9cdacbf96fe1c1a71, copying a texture from a render texture causes it to be flipped.\r\n\r\nIn the code below, the left sprite is drawn correctly, while the right sprite (the one where the texture is copied before passing it to the sprite) is flipped vertically.\r\n```c++\r\n#include <SFML/Graphics.hpp>\r\n\r\nint main()\r\n{\r\n    sf::RenderWindow window(sf::VideoMode(400, 200), \"SFML Window\");\r\n\r\n    sf::RectangleShape shape{{100, 100}};\r\n    shape.setFillColor(sf::Color::Red);\r\n\r\n    sf::RenderTexture rt;\r\n    rt.create(200, 200);\r\n    rt.clear(sf::Color::White);\r\n    rt.draw(shape);\r\n    rt.display();\r\n\r\n    sf::Sprite s1(rt.getTexture());\r\n\r\n    sf::Texture t = rt.getTexture(); // Copy texture before passing it to sprite\r\n    sf::Sprite s2(t);\r\n    s2.setPosition({200, 0});\r\n\r\n    while (window.isOpen())\r\n    {\r\n        sf::Event event;\r\n        while
