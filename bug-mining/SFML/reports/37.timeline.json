binary1248. Thanks for your prompt reply. I have managed to track down the source of this issue. It turns out that I was loading a shader from a file before a render window was being created. Normally this doesn't change anything, but if a thread gets launched after the window creation, and if it attempts to load a texture (haven't tested it with other resource types) from a file, any thread afterwards that attempts to get a lock on the context will end up sleeping forever, waiting for it to be unlocked. Here's the minimal code snippet to reproduce the issue:\n\n```\nvoid Test() {\n    sf::Texture t;\n    t.loadFromFile(\"SomeTexture.png\");\n    std::cout << \"Texture loaded!\" << std::endl;\n}\n\nint main() {\n    sf::Shader shader;\n    shader.loadFromFile(\"default.vert\", \"default.frag\");\n    sf::RenderWindow window(sf::VideoMode(640,480), \"Window\");\n    sf::Thread t(&Test);\n    t.launch(); // <-- Program runs fine if this line is commented out.\n    bool running = true;\n    while (running) {\n        sf::Event event;\n        while (window.pollEvent(event)) {\n            if (event.type == sf::Event::Closed) { running = false; }\n        }\n        window.clear();\n        window.display();\n    }\n    window.close();\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\nIt was rather stupid of me to load a shader before the window is created. It did throw me for a loop though, considering the fact that everything ran just fine until a thread attempted to load a texture.\n\nEDIT: The documentation also doesn't say anywhere that a window needs to be created.\n","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/SFML/SFML/issues/comments/257134725/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"DedMorozCodes","id":16481743,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NDgxNzQz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16481743?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/DedMorozCodes","html_url":"https://github.com/DedMorozCodes","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DedMorozCodes/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DedMorozCodes/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DedMorozCodes/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DedMorozCodes/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DedMorozCodes/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DedMorozCodes/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DedMorozCodes/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DedMorozCodes/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DedMorozCodes/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":845229882,"node_id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDg0NTIyOTg4Mg==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/SFML/SFML/issues/events/845229882","actor":{"login":"binary1248","id":949359,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk0OTM1OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/949359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/binary1248","html_url":"https://github.com/binary1248","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/binary1248/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/binary1248/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/binary1248/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/binary1248/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/binary1248/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/binary1248/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/binary1248/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/binary1248/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/binary1248/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2016-11-02T16:54:20Z","label":{"name":"s:accepted","color":"207de5"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":845229884,"node_id":"MDE0OlVubGFiZWxlZEV2ZW50ODQ1MjI5ODg0","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/SFML/SFML/issues/events/845229884","actor":{"login":"binary1248","id":949359,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk0OTM1OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/949359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/binary1248","html_url":"https://github.com/binary1248","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/binary1248/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/binary1248/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/binary1248/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/binary1248/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/binary1248/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/binary1248/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/binary1248/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/binary1248/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/binary1248/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"unlabeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2016-11-02T16:54:20Z","label":{"name":"s:undecided","color":"ffe20a"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":845230007,"node_id":"MDE1Ok1pbGVzdG9uZWRFdmVudDg0NTIzMDAwNw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/SFML/SFML/issues/events/845230007","actor":{"login":"binary1248","id":949359,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk0OTM1OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/949359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/binary1248","html_url":"https://github.com/binary1248","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/binary1248/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/binary1248/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/binary1248/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/binary1248/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/binary1248/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/binary1248/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/binary1248/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/binary1248/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/binary1248/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"milestoned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2016-
