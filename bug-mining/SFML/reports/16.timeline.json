This fixes issue #437, except Alt+F4, which would be a different issue?\n- This is essentially based around @All8Up's suggestion.\n- The new member variable `m_focused` is meant to be exposed later on so the user is able to determine whether the window is active without doing separate event tracking.\n- Activating mouse clicks aren't passed to the event queue. This is something not really consistent across games or applications in general, but I prefer this behavior (avoids triggering anything by accident).\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/SFML/SFML/issues/457/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/SFML/SFML/issues/457/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":62840764,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDYyODQwNzY0","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/SFML/SFML/issues/events/62840764","actor":{"login":"MarioLiebisch","id":1854245,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NTQyNDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1854245?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MarioLiebisch","html_url":"https://github.com/MarioLiebisch","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MarioLiebisch/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MarioLiebisch/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MarioLiebisch/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MarioLiebisch/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MarioLiebisch/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MarioLiebisch/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MarioLiebisch/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MarioLiebisch/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MarioLiebisch/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"383566a46887d73bab3af6566f88449c2f2b53ef","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MarioLiebisch/SFML/commits/383566a46887d73bab3af6566f88449c2f2b53ef","created_at":"2013-08-28T13:32:16Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"actor":{"login":"Wizzard033","id":721311,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcyMTMxMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/721311?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Wizzard033","html_url":"https://github.com/Wizzard033","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Wizzard033/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Wizzard033/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Wizzard033/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Wizzard033/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Wizzard033/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Wizzard033/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Wizzard033/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Wizzard033/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Wizzard033/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2013-09-19T12:30:29Z","updated_at":"2013-09-19T12:30:29Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/SFML/SFML/issues/471","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/SFML/SFML","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/SFML/SFML/issues/471/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/SFML/SFML/issues/471/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/SFML/SFML/issues/471/events","html_url":"https://github.com/SFML/SFML/issues/471","id":19750993,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWUxOTc1MDk5Mw==","number":471,"title":"Global
