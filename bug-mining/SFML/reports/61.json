Subject of the issue\r\n\r\nfind_package(Vorbis REQUIRED) fail quietly, and make fail configuration later in the process\r\n\r\nCMake is case-sensitive however VORBIS is used instead of Vorbis in FindVorbis.cmake file which cause it to not see the Vorbis_FIND_REQUIRED which should make the configuration failed on `find_package(Vorbis REQUIRED)` and not later when using variables\r\n\r\nPossible fixes\r\n- Change FindVorbis.cmake to FindVORBIS.cmake and use `find_package(VORBIS REQUIRED)` instead\r\n- Use `Vorbis*` variables instead of `VORBIS*` ones in FindVorbis (requires to fix cmake using old variables)\r\n\r\n## Your environment\r\n\r\nOS:Ubuntu 18.04\r\nSFML: master(80c3bdc23c1874494196bbf8a481a859712ece88)\r\nCompiler: Not relevant\r\n\r\n## Steps to
