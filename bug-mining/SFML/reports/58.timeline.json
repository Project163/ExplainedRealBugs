Never looked too deep into this, but since this is actually triggered by the triple `///`, I guess we could actually fix that on our end by using one of the other formats.\r\n\r\nJust to be sure: I'm assuming you're trying to read the tooltip/information for some data member somewhere?\r\n\r\n```cpp\r\nlong some_member_variable; ///< This is a single line style comment for Doxygen\r\n```\r\n\r\nIntelliSense will misinterpret the opening `<` as the start of an XML tag and therefore display the error message.\r\n\r\nAs a workaround, you should be able to look through the
