I guess in C++11 you can use std::move as well.\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/SFML/SFML/issues/comments/41248050/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"LaurentGomila","id":245489,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NTQ4OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/245489?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/LaurentGomila","html_url":"https://github.com/LaurentGomila","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LaurentGomila/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LaurentGomila/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LaurentGomila/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LaurentGomila/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LaurentGomila/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LaurentGomila/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LaurentGomila/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LaurentGomila/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LaurentGomila/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/SFML/SFML/issues/comments/41248609","html_url":"https://github.com/SFML/SFML/issues/508#issuecomment-41248609","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/SFML/SFML/issues/508","id":41248609,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQxMjQ4NjA5","user":{"login":"Bromeon","id":708488,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcwODQ4OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/708488?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bromeon","html_url":"https://github.com/Bromeon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bromeon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bromeon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bromeon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bromeon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bromeon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bromeon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bromeon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bromeon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bromeon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-04-24T07:07:02Z","updated_at":"2014-04-24T07:10:24Z","body":"Yes, the object falls out of scope when its constructor throws; but this is deliberate, since you have no object that you can use (it's not allowed to do anything meaningful with an object that has not been constructed).\n\nIn this case, if you needed a local variable, you could do as follows -- maybe we could then even remove the `create()` method:\n\n``` cpp\nsf::Window window;\ntry\n{\n    window = sf::Window(...); // C++11 move\n}\ncatch (...)\n{\n    std::err << \"failed to create window\";\n}\n```\n\nBut this application of `try/catch` is rather rare in C++, compared to Java for example, where it's the standard approach.

C++ provides no other mechanisms than using some kind of pointer and allocation of the object during runtime (in languages like C# and Java it's done exactly the same way as I proposed, the only difference is that everything is a reference, and ergo you can use _null_ as the initial value). I wouldn't say that it's an SFML-way of doing things (just like I wouldn't say that default-constructing a window with an invalid state + being able to create() it later is an SFML way).\n\nAdditionally there is a lot of code in the Window class that does check for a valid internal state, and some code even returns questionable results. Examples:\n- Window::getSettings(): Returns \"empty\" context settings (\"What are empty settings?\"). A call to this function should technically not be possible on an object that does not have a context, especially because a context is not optional, it's required.\n- Window::getPosition(): Returns (0, 0) if the window hasn't been created yet. It's wrong, because there is no position.\n- Window::getSize(): Same as getPosition().\n- Window:set*(): Nearly all setters do check for a valid state -- calls to these functions should not be possible without a window -- I'd even declare this as an exceptional situation.\n\nNormally when you want to express a \"I will create/initialize this object later\" in C++, you use a pointer.\n\nWhat do others think about this?\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/SFML/SFML/issues/comments/41261414/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"TankOs","id":111807,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMTgwNw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/111807?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/TankOs","html_url":"https://github.com/TankOs","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TankOs/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TankOs/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TankOs/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TankOs/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TankOs/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TankOs/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TankOs/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TankOs/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TankOs/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/SFML/SFML/issues/comments/41262667","html_url":"https://github.com/SFML/SFML/issues/508#issuecomment-41262667","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/SFML/SFML/issues/508","id":41262667,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQxMjYyNjY3","user":{"login":"mantognini","id":693483,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY5MzQ4Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/693483?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mantognini","html_url":"https://github.com/mantognini","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mantognini/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mantognini/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mantognini/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mantognini/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mantognini/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mantognini/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mantognini/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mantognini/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mantognini/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-04-24T09:58:00Z","updated_at":"2014-04-24T09:58:00Z","body":"While I agree with you – it would definitely a more logical way of doing things – I have a concern: what about integration with other tools like Qt, Cocoa, Win32, ...?

All it does is prevent leaving Window in a \"unusable\" state, which can prevent coding errors if .create() is forgotten (no idea how often this might happen).\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/SFML/SFML/issues/comments/41264220/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"binary1248","id":949359,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk0OTM1OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/949359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/binary1248","html_url":"https://github.com/binary1248","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/binary1248/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/binary1248/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/binary1248/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/binary1248/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/binary1248/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/binary1248/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/binary1248/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/binary1248/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/binary1248/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/SFML/SFML/issues/comments/41269922","html_url":"https://github.com/SFML/SFML/issues/508#issuecomment-41269922","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/SFML/SFML/issues/508","id":41269922,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQxMjY5OTIy","user":{"login":"LaurentGomila","id":245489,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NTQ4OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/245489?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/LaurentGomila","html_url":"https://github.com/LaurentGomila","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LaurentGomila/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LaurentGomila/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LaurentGomila/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LaurentGomila/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LaurentGomila/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LaurentGomila/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LaurentGomila/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LaurentGomila/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LaurentGomila/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-04-24T11:35:29Z","updated_at":"2014-04-24T11:36:38Z","body":"Everyone agrees that a default-constructed sf::Window is useless, and that the best thing to do is to prevent it, but still, how do you solve the use case shown above, which is very common?
