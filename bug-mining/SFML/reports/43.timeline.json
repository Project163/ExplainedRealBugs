The problem (and justification for the warning) is that the current implementation _is allowed to_ invoke undefined behaviour when compiled by optimizing compilers. Even though we are telling the compiler to read the same address \"in a different way\" it will have no objections to reading from a completely different address because it assumes that pointers to objects of different types cannot reside at the same address.\r\n\r\n@LaurentGomila The solution you propose would work in trivial cases, however there are edge cases where we really shouldn't try to be overly smart. If the user for whatever reason wants to scale glyphs using an `sf::View`, this would unnecessarily force them to make due with the fact that glyphs are only rasterized by SFML in discrete size increments. Considering that we have enough bits in the key to represent the 32+1+21 bits required, and the user has to explicitly request text with very similar sizes (i.e. this can't unintentionally happen), I can't see any reason why we should go through the extra effort and risk looking for a solution to a problem that doesn't exist.","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/SFML/SFML/issues/comments/275289918/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"binary1248","id":949359,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk0OTM1OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/949359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/binary1248","html_url":"https://github.com/binary1248","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/binary1248/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/binary1248/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/binary1248/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/binary1248/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/binary1248/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/binary1248/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/binary1248/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/binary1248/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/binary1248/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":937131663,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50OTM3MTMxNjYz","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/SFML/SFML/issues/events/937131663","actor":{"login":"LaurentGomila","id":245489,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NTQ4OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/245489?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/LaurentGomila","html_url":"https://github.com/LaurentGomila","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LaurentGomila/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LaurentGomila/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LaurentGomila/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LaurentGomila/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LaurentGomila/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LaurentGomila/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LaurentGomila/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LaurentGomila/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LaurentGomila/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2017-01-26T01:59:58Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":937131664,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDkzNzEzMTY2NA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/SFML/SFML/issues/events/937131664","actor":{"login":"LaurentGomila","id":245489,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NTQ4OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/245489?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/LaurentGomila","html_url":"https://github.com/LaurentGomila","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LaurentGomila/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LaurentGomila/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LaurentGomila/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LaurentGomila/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LaurentGomila/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LaurentGomila/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LaurentGomila/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LaurentGomila/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LaurentGomila/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2017-01-26T01:59:58Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/SFML/SFML/issues/comments/275344619","html_url":"https://github.com/SFML/SFML/issues/1187#issuecomment-275344619","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/SFML/SFML/issues/1187","id":275344619,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI3NTM0NDYxOQ==","user":{"login":"jcowgill","id":1226825,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMjY4MjU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1226825?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jcowgill","html_url":"https://github.com/jcowgill","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jcowgill/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jcowgill/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jcowgill/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jcowgill/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jcowgill/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jcowgill/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jcowgill/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jcowgill/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jcowgill/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"20

How so?\r\n\r\n`std::memcpy` is endian-independant unless it is completely broken and arithmetic operations are guaranteed to be endian-independant by the language standards, see [here](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7184789/does-bit-shift-depend-on-endianness). The fact that we are forcing the binary contents of an int into a float already throws any sense of value preservation out the window. The only thing we are interested in here is getting a 1:1 bijective mapping from any (float, bool, int31) triple to uint64_t. We aren't interested in the actual value of the result.","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/SFML/SFML/issues/comments/275445118/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"binary1248","id":949359,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk0OTM1OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/949359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/binary1248","html_url":"https://github.com/binary1248","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/binary1248/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/binary1248/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/binary1248/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/binary1248/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/binary1248/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/binary1248/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/binary1248/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/binary1248/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/binary1248/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":938092006,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50OTM4MDkyMDA2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/SFML/SFML/issues/events/938092006","actor":{"login":"jcowgill","id":1226825,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMjY4MjU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1226825?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jcowgill","html_url":"https://github.com/jcowgill","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jcowgill/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jcowgill/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jcowgill/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jcowgill/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jcowgill/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jcowgill/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jcowgill/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jcowgill/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jcowgill/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2017-01-26T17:01:46Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":938092007,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDkzODA5MjAwNw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/SFML/SFML/issues/events/938092007","actor":{"login":"jcowgill","id":1226825,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMjY4MjU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1226825?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jcowgill","html_url":"https://github.com/jcowgill","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jcowgill/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jcowgill/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jcowgill/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jcowgill/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jcowgill/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jcowgill/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jcowgill/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jcowgill/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jcowgill/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2017-01-26T17:01:46Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/SFML/SFML/issues/comments/275452815","html_url":"https://github.com/SFML/SFML/issues/1187#issuecomment-275452815","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/SFML/SFML/issues/1187","id":275452815,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI3NTQ1MjgxNQ==","user":{"login":"jcowgill","id":1226825,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMjY4MjU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1226825?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jcowgill","html_url":"https://github.com/jcowgill","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jcowgill/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jcowgill/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jcowgill/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jcowgill/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jcowgill/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jcowgill/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jcowgill/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jcowgill/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jcowgill/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-01-26T17:28:35Z","updated_at":"2017-01-26T17:28:35Z","body":"Example:\r\n```cpp\r\n#include
