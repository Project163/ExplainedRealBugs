rw.create(reinterpret_cast<sf::WindowHandle>(form.native_handle()));\n\n    form.events().destroy([&rw]() { rw.close(); });\n    form.events().focus([&rw]() {rw.clear(sf::Color(50, 60, 50)); rw.display(); });\n\n    form.show();\n    nana::exec();\n\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\nThe above works fine on Windows using VS2015 (as does my actual use case).\n\nPossibly related is the X11 example which builds and runs, but closing the window leaves the SFML windows behind:\n![](http://djfallen.com/images/x11.png)\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/SFML/SFML/issues/1016/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/SFML/SFML/issues/1016/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"actor":{"login":"vittorioromeo","id":918661,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkxODY2MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/918661?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vittorioromeo","html_url":"https://github.com/vittorioromeo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vittorioromeo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vittorioromeo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vittorioromeo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vittorioromeo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vittorioromeo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vittorioromeo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vittorioromeo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vittorioromeo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vittorioromeo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-06-08T23:01:39Z","updated_at":"2024-06-08T23:01:39Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/SFML/SFML/issues/3079","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/SFML/SFML","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/SFML/SFML/issues/3079/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/SFML/SFML/issues/3079/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/SFML/SFML/issues/3079/events","html_url":"https://github.com/SFML/SFML/issues/3079","id":2340853325,"node_id":"I_kwDOABdDzM6LhpZN","number":3079,"title":"`SoundEffects.cpp`

invalid accesses at these lines. It seems like, in the first case, there is a mismatch in the size of `filters` (which is `music.getChannelCount()`) and the index `channel` (which goes up to `frameChannelCount`). \r\n\r\nIn my machine, `music.getChannelCount() == 2` and `frameChannelCount == 8`.\r\n\r\n```cpp\r\n// L926\r\n    outputFrames[channel] = *enabled ? filters[channel](input) : input;\r\n//
