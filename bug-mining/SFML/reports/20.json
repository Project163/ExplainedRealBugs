blending modes are often requested.\n\nTwo solutions:\n- add more blending modes to the sf::BlendMode enumeration\n- make the API more flexible, allow to set source and destination operators instead of a fixed list of modes\n\nA blending mode which is often requested is premultiplied alpha (which would come with a `sf::Image::convertToPremultipliedAlpha` function).\n\nForum topics:\n-
