I can't say whether this is a good solution or not, so I'm hoping someone else can!","closed_by":{"login":"eXpl0it3r","id":920861,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyMDg2MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/920861?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/eXpl0it3r","html_url":"https://github.com/eXpl0it3r","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eXpl0it3r/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eXpl0it3r/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eXpl0it3r/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eXpl0it3r/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eXpl0it3r/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eXpl0it3r/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eXpl0it3r/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eXpl0it3r/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eXpl0it3r/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/SFML/SFML/issues/1471/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/SFML/SFML/issues/1471/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
