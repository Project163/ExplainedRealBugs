Currently, I have font enabled and disabled by pressing the s key https://github.com/dogunbound/CSFML_2.6_sample \r\n\r\nI hope we can hack this out. 2.6.x is pretty stable, so I think it would be good to begin working on this.\r\n\r\nBasically, we need to slowly go through EVERY pull request and see if any change needs to be made and make those changes.
