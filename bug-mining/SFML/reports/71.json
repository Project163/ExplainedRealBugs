Prerequisite Checklist\n\n- [X] I searched for [existing issues](https://github.com/search?q=repo%3ASFML%2FSFML&type=issues) to prevent duplicates\n- [X] I searched for [existing discussions on the forum](https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ahttps%3A%2F%2Fen.sfml-dev.org) to prevent duplicates\n- [X] I am here to report an issue and not to just ask a question or look for help (use the [forum](https://en.sfml-dev.org/forums/index.php#c3) or [Discord](https://discord.gg/nr4X7Fh) instead)\n\n### Describe your issue here\n\nI am creating a program with Qt 6.8 and SFML, I started off with SFML 2.6 and I decided to upgrade to SFML 3.0.\r\nMigrating gave me no issues other than a new bug that involves `sf::Window::create(sf::WindowHandle Handle)`.\r\nThe program becomes unresponsive only when I use this specific overload.\r\n\r\nThis appears to only happen on the Windows build, as Linux doesn't experience this issue.\r\n\r\nI found a forum post from 2016 that talks about the same issue that appears to have returned:\r\nhttps://en.sfml-dev.org/forums/index.php?topic=21049.msg150558#msg150558\r\n\r\nSadly there are no error messages that I know of, the program just becomes unresponsive.\n\n### Your Environment\n\n- OS / distro / window manager: Windows 10\r\n- SFML version: 3.0.0\r\n- Compiler / toolchain: MingGW\r\n- Special compiler / CMake flags: \r\n\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\n1. Start Program\r\n\r\n```cpp\r\n#include <QApplication>\r\n#include <QWidget>\r\n#include <QObject>\r\n#include <QScopedPointer>\r\n\r\n#include <SFML/Graphics.hpp>\r\n\r\nclass GameDisplay : public QWidget\r\n{\r\n    Q_OBJECT\r\npublic:\r\n    explicit GameDisplay(QWidget *parent = nullptr, QString rom_url = QString()) : QWidget{parent},\r\n                                                                                    render_window(new sf::RenderWindow(sf::VideoMode({800, 600}), \"OpenGL\", sf::Style::Default)),\r\n                                                                                    texture({800, 600}),\r\n                                                                                    sprite(texture),\r\n                                                                                    m_initialized(false)\r\n    {\r\n        // Window attributes\r\n        setAttribute(Qt::WA_PaintOnScreen);\r\n        setAttribute(Qt::WA_OpaquePaintEvent);\r\n        setAttribute(Qt::WA_NoSystemBackground);\r\n        setAttribute(Qt::WA_DeleteOnClose);\r\n\r\n        setWindowFlags(Qt::Window);\r\n        resize(800, 600);\r\n    };\r\n    ~GameDisplay(){};\r\n\r\nprivate:\r\n    QScopedPointer<sf::RenderWindow> render_window;\r\n    sf::Texture texture;\r\n    sf::Sprite sprite;\r\n    bool m_initialized;\r\n\r\nprotected:\r\n    void showEvent(QShowEvent *event) override\r\n    {\r\n        // Initial initialization of the SFML widget\r\n        if (!m_initialized)\r\n        {\r\n\r\n            render_window->create(sf::WindowHandle(winId())); // QWidget::winId() returns a native handle\r\n            render_window->clear(sf::Color::Blue);\r\n            render_window->draw(sprite);\r\n            render_window->display();\r\n\r\n        }\r\n    };\r\n    \r\n    QPaintEngine *paintEngine() const override\r\n    {\r\n        return nullptr;\r\n    };\r\n};\r\n\r\n#include \"Main.moc\" // Enable MOC for GameDisplay\r\n\r\nint main(int argc, char **argv)\r\n{\r\n    QApplication a(argc, argv);\r\n\r\n    GameDisplay w;\r\n    w.show();\r\n\r\n    return a.exec();\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nThe program should respond and SFML's output should display within the confines of Qt's QWidget, which in this case is the GameDisplay class from the example\n\n### Actual behavior\n\nThe program becomes unresponsive","closed_by":{"login":"ChrisThrasher","id":39244355,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5MjQ0MzU1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/39244355?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChrisThrasher","html_url":"https://github.com/ChrisThrasher","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChrisThrasher/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChrisThrasher/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChrisThrasher/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChrisThrasher/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChrisThrasher/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChrisThrasher/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChrisThrasher/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChrisThrasher/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ChrisThrasher/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/SFML/SFML/issues/3369/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/SFML/SFML/issues/3369/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
