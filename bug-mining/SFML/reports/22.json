The crashes happened within SFML itself. Now they're probably because I did something dumb somewhere upstream of SFML, but nevertheless, the crash can be avoided on SFML's side.\n\nThe problem comes from the fact there is a division by a value done without checking that the value is actually not null (if bits is less than 8, it'll become null after integer division). I worked around that with a ?:1 but a MIN(,1) would also work. An assert or error logger check could be placed there maybe.\n\n```\n            // Retrieve its size and add it to the samples count\n            if (m_endBuffers[bufferNum])\n            {\n                // This was the last buffer: reset the sample count\n                m_samplesProcessed = 0;\n                m_endBuffers[bufferNum] = false;\n            }\n            else\n            {\n                ALint size, bits;\n                alCheck(alGetBufferi(buffer, AL_SIZE, &size));\n                alCheck(alGetBufferi(buffer, AL_BITS, &bits));\n                m_samplesProcessed += size / ((bits / 8) ? (bits / 8) : 1);\n            }\n```\n\nNow on my side I get to try to understand why OpenAL reports less than 8 bits. Samples are supposed to be 16 bits.\n","closed_by":{"login":"Bromeon","id":708488,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcwODQ4OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/708488?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bromeon","html_url":"https://github.com/Bromeon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bromeon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bromeon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bromeon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bromeon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bromeon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bromeon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bromeon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bromeon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bromeon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/SFML/SFML/issues/529/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/SFML/SFML/issues/529/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
