i am current creating a smaller more compact version of SFML mainly for use as my inhouse game engine, i came across a bug with EGLContext and patched it, but seeing as my engines code cant being integrated i would just like to post it as an issue and hopefully someone in the community can create a patch based on my findings,\r\n\r\nthis effects all versions of SFML supporting android to date, including 2.5.x\r\n\r\nunder the EGLContext.cpp file\r\n\r\n    //-------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n    void EglContext::destroySurface()\r\n    {\t\r\n\t    eglCheck(eglDestroySurface(m_display, m_surface));\r\n\t    m_surface = EGL_NO_SURFACE;\r\n\r\n           // Ensure that this context is no longer active since our surface is now destroyed\r\n\t   setActive(false);\r\n    }\r\n\r\nthis code is bugged, you are essentially calling makecurrent with no surface which will in part cause many issues, the solution is pretty simple just move setActive before you destroy the active surface,\r\n\r\n    //-------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n    void EglContext::destroySurface()\r\n    {\r\n  \t    // Ensure that this context is no longer active since our surface is now destroyed\r\n\t    setActive(false);\r\n\t\r\n\t    eglCheck(eglDestroySurface(m_display, m_surface));\r\n  \t    m_surface = EGL_NO_SURFACE;\r\n    }\r\n\r\nhope this helps, cheers
