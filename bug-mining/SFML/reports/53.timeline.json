This is something we plan to improve in a future version. Concerning this specific X11 error, I'm not sure what the exact reason why it fails is.\n\n> Also, when I try to run a SFML program when $DISPLAY is blank (such as from a tmux session not connected to X) I get a segfault. \n\nAn error message is output, see #508. Please make sure you use the latest GitHub revision when reporting problems, it doesn't make to investigate things that have been fixed meanwhile

managed to reproduce this using Xephyr by running `Xephyr :1 -screen 500x500 -screen 500x500` which creates two screens on :1.0 and :1.1\n\nI had a small look at this and I think that `GlxContext::selectBestVisual` is returning visuals for the wrong screen. Currently the XCB port (#694) fixes this since it only considers visuals from the default screen instead of all screens.\n\n---\n\n@pubby My multi monitor setup using RandR (which seems to be what most WMs are using these days) works fine with SFML.
