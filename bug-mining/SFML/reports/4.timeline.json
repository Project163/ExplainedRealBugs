can be used to reproduce the problem:\n\n```\n#include <nana/gui/wvl.hpp>\n#include <SFML/Graphics/RenderWindow.hpp>\n\nint main()\n{   \n    nana::form form;\n\n    sf::RenderWindow rw;\n    rw.create(reinterpret_cast<sf::WindowHandle>(form.native_handle()));\n\n    form.events().destroy([&rw]() { rw.close(); });\n    form.events().focus([&rw]() {rw.clear(sf::Color(50, 60, 50)); rw.display(); });\n\n    form.show();\n    nana::exec();\n\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\nThe above works fine on Windows using VS2015 (as does my actual use case).\n\nPossibly related is the X11 example which builds and runs, but closing the window leaves the SFML windows behind:\n![](http://djfallen.com/images/x11.png)\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/SFML/SFML/issues/1016/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/SFML/SFML/issues/1016/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"actor":{"login":"eXpl0it3r","id":920861,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyMDg2MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/920861?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/eXpl0it3r","html_url":"https://github.com/eXpl0it3r","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eXpl0it3r/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eXpl0it3r/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eXpl0it3r/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eXpl0it3r/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eXpl0it3r/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eXpl0it3r/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eXpl0it3r/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eXpl0it3r/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eXpl0it3r/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-04-05T21:11:25Z","updated_at":"2018-04-05T21:11:25Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/SFML/SFML/issues/1402","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/SFML/SFML","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/SFML/SFML/issues/1402/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/SFML/SFML/issues/1402/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/SFML/SFML/issues/1402/events","html_url":"https://github.com/SFML/SFML/pull/1402","id":311768723,"node_id":"MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0MTc5Nzk2Mjg1","number":1402,"title":"Use

Compiler / toolchain: Apple clang version 15.0.0 (clang-1500.3.9.4)\r\n- Special compiler / CMake flags: /\r\n\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\nExample code:\r\n```\r\n#include <SFML/Graphics.hpp>\r\n#include <iostream>\r\n\r\nint main() {\r\n    // Create the main window\r\n    sf::Window window(sf::VideoMode({640, 480}), \"SFML window with OpenGL\");\r\n}\r\n\r\n```\r\nMakefile I used (the frameworks seem to be necessary for it to link):\r\n```\r\nCPPFLAGS += -Iinclude -std=c++2b\r\nLDFLAGS += -framework CoreFoundation -framework IOKit -framework Carbon -framework AppKit -framework CoreGraphics -framework OpenAL -Llib\r\n\r\ntest: test.o\r\n\tg++ test.o -o test $(CPPFLAGS) $(LDFLAGS) -lsfml-graphics-s -lsfml-system-s -lsfml-window-s\r\n\r\ntest.o: test.cpp\r\n\tg++ -c test.cpp -o test.o $(CPPFLAGS)\r\n\r\nclean:\r\n\trm test test.o\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\n\r\nIt should work without crashing\r\n\r\n### Actual behavior\r\n\r\nIt crashes","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/SFML/SFML/issues/2920/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/SFML/SFML/issues/2920/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"actor":{"login":"vittorioromeo","id":918661,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkxODY2MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/918661?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vittorioromeo","html_url":"https://github.com/vittorioromeo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vittorioromeo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vittorioromeo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vittorioromeo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vittorioromeo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vittorioromeo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vittorioromeo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vittorioromeo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vittorioromeo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vittorioromeo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-06-08T23:01:39Z","updated_at":"2024-06-08T23:01:39Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/SFML/SFML/issues/3079","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/SFML/SFML","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/SFML/SFML/issues/3079/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/SFML/SFML/issues/3079/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/SFML/SFML/issues/3079/events","html_url":"https://github.com/SFML/SFML/issues/3079","id":2340853325,"node_id":"I_kwDOABdDzM6LhpZN","number":3079,"title":"`SoundEffects.cpp`

invalid accesses at these lines. It seems like, in the first case, there is a mismatch in the size of `filters` (which is `music.getChannelCount()`) and the index `channel` (which goes up to `frameChannelCount`). \r\n\r\nIn my machine, `music.getChannelCount() == 2` and `frameChannelCount == 8`.\r\n\r\n```cpp\r\n// L926\r\n    outputFrames[channel] = *enabled ? filters[channel](input) : input;\r\n//
