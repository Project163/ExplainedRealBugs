He opens the game in full-screen, at first launch game picks the **sf::VideoMode::getDesktopMode()** -> **3840x1080** which is both monitors combined. It's not terrible but still is every user has to change it so I consider it as a bad thing. When he changes it to **1920x1080**, game runs on the second monitor only, and **main monitor shuts down**, no signal.\r\n\r\nCan someone with similar setup try this?","closed_by":{"login":"eXpl0it3r","id":920861,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyMDg2MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/920861?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/eXpl0it3r","html_url":"https://github.com/eXpl0it3r","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eXpl0it3r/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eXpl0it3r/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eXpl0it3r/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eXpl0it3r/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eXpl0it3r/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eXpl0it3r/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eXpl0it3r/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eXpl0it3r/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eXpl0it3r/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/SFML/SFML/issues/1226/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/SFML/SFML/issues/1226/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
