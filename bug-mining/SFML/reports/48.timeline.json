tried that yet. This sounds like a good idea, but then we'd force people into using **sfml-main**, even if they'd like to write or use their own wrapper code, e.g. to do exception handling.

NvOptimusEnablement and AmdPowerXpressRequestHighPerformance out of sfml-main and into a macro the user can place in their own translation unit when they need it.\r\n\r\nThe current implementation suffers from a bunch of problems:\r\n* It doesn't work when using the console subsystem, see #1192\r\n* It can't work when linking all of SFML dynamically (this implies not linking sfml-main obviously)\r\n* When linking sfml-main for portability, the user can't opt out of preferring the discrete GPU when they know they won't need the extra performance\r\n* This \"feature\" was never documented, only people following the commit history or who browse through the code will know this exists\r\n* Exporting symbols via `__declspec(dllexport)` from a static library is just weird in itself anyway\r\n\r\nWith this change, the user will have full control over when they want this preference to be made, and the symbols will always be exported from the right place: the final executable. And there is the added bonus that this will actually show up in the documentation as well (might still be hard to find though).\r\n
