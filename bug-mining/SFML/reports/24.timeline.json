It would make a lot of sense, that if you create a new window the old properties are thrown away and you get the default ones.\nBut the way I see it, especially for game programming, 99% of the time `.create()` is used to switch between windowed mode and fullscreen (in the running app i.e. not at setup). Of course it's anoying if you then have to reset all the properties. I think for all other cases, if you `.create()` a window, you'd expect it to be new and set to the default properties.\nSo I'd say everything should stay as it is, but there should be a method that allows switching to fullscreen mode, without having to recreate the window (as far as I know there is already a method that does that in the implementation for sf::Window, it would just have to be exposed)\n","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/SFML/SFML/issues/comments/23551658/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"Foaly","id":1014762,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMTQ3NjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1014762?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Foaly","html_url":"https://github.com/Foaly","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Foaly/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Foaly/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Foaly/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Foaly/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Foaly/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Foaly/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Foaly/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Foaly/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Foaly/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/SFML/SFML/issues/comments/23552597","html_url":"https://github.com/SFML/SFML/issues/371#issuecomment-23552597","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/SFML/SFML/issues/371","id":23552597,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIzNTUyNTk3","user":{"login":"Ixrec","id":5285357,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyODUzNTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5285357?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ixrec","html_url":"https://github.com/Ixrec","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ixrec/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ixrec/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ixrec/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ixrec/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ixrec/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ixrec/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ixrec/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ixrec/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ixrec/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2013-08-30T10:23:04Z","updated_at":"2013-08-30T10:23:04Z","body":"In
