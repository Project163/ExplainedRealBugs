However, this happens when both a sample is written for the left and the right (or any other channel).\r\n\r\nThis causes the weird discrepancy reported above.

#1280.\r\n\r\nPreviously when updating the header fields, SFML assumed the number of samples written would be the number of samples per channel, which wasn't the case. Therefore for stereo files the written file length was actually twice the correct value. This fix uses the file size written as a basis, no longer counting the samples written
