I get this error when I try to run the \"window\" example with a freshly compiled SFML2:\n\n> X Error of failed request:  GLXBadContext\n>  Major opcode of failed request:  154 (GLX)\n>  Minor opcode of failed request:  3 (X_GLXCreateContext)\n>  Serial number of failed request:  25\n>  Current serial number in output stream:  30\n\nNo window opens it just crashes with the above message.\nI tried the \"window\" example from 1.6.3 and it works(with SFML1.6.3) \n\nSome information about my system:\n\n> direct rendering: Yes\n> server glx vendor string: SGI\n> server glx version string: 1.4\n>
