It's not just that it doesn't work in OS X, but that there's absolutely no support for mouse locking within SFML's feature set.\n\nThe approach above will never work, even if the delay is removed, because the mouse can be moved so fast that acceleration will carry it right outside of the window and mouse events will stop being received.  Trying to catch that case with <tt>Event::MouseLeft</tt> will seem like a sensible fix, but it won't actually work.\n\n<tt>sf::Window</tt> needs a new style called <tt>sf::Style::LockMouse</tt> and a mouse-locking implementation at the Window level written for all supported platforms.  Or, if you want to be able to grab and release the mouse, then we need methods on <tt>sf::Window</tt> to grab and release the mouse.\n\nAs for implementing it on OS X, it's fairly simple but is tricky to fit into SFML's event loop.\n\nTo lock the mouse, simply:\n\n``` c++\n    /* Mouse::setPosition has to be called anytime the window moves, otherwise\n     * clicking will cause the window to lose focus.  The locked cursor will be\n     * sitting right where we left it, but now the window will be somewhere else\n     * and whatever was under it (desktop, other window, etc.) gets the click.\n     */\n    Mouse::setPosition(Vector2i(0, 0), window);\n\n    // Is there an SFML call to hide the mouse?\n    CGDisplayHideCursor(kCGDirectMainDisplay);\n\n    /* Disconnect the mouse from the cursor.  Mouse movements happen,\n     * but no longer update the cursor location.\n     */\n    CGAssociateMouseAndMouseCursorPosition(FALSE);\n\n    Vector2i mouseLastPos;\n    Vector2i mousePos;\n\n    while(/* some looping condition */) {\n        CGGetLastMouseDelta(&mousePos.x, &mousePos.y);\n        if (mouseLastPos != mousePos) {\n\n            // If delta was not just a re-centering event...\n            if (mousePos.x != 0 || mousePos.y != 0) {\n                postAnSfmlMouseMovedEvent(mousePos.x, mousePos.y);\n                cout << mousePos.x << \", \" << mousePos.y << std::endl;\n            }\n\n            mouseLastPos = mousePos;\n        }\n    }\n```\n\nSo all of the code before the loop needs to happen _inside_ SFML's OS X window implementation.  I imagine the user would access mouse locking with something like the following:\n\n``` c++\n    sf::Window window(VideoMode(500, 500), \"Mouse Locker\", sf::Style::LockMouse);\n\n    // Or...\n\n    window.lockMouse();\n```\n\nAnd then in the main event loop, somehow SFML would need to perform the chunk of code in the loop above.  Maybe on a separate thread?  Can SFML post messages from other threads back into the main thread?  What needs to happen is that some loop somewhere is constantly looking at `CGGetLastMouseDelta`.  Anytime the delta changes and is NOT a (0, 0) event, SFML needs to send out a `sf::Event::MouseMoved` with the relative coordinates received from `CGGetLastMouseDelta`.\n\nDoing this will eliminate the delay issue and will make it impossible for the mouse cursor to ever escape the window.\n\nIt's not a quick and easy change, unfortunately.  It's a new feature.  This is the only way SFML is going to get a working mouse-lock implementation though.\n","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/SFML/SFML/issues/comments/9279071/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"beverlycodes","id":281412,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4MTQxMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/281412?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/beverlycodes","html_url":"https://github.com/beverlycodes","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beverlycodes/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beverlycodes/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beverlycodes/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beverlycodes/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beverlycodes/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beverlycodes/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beverlycodes/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beverlycodes/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beverlycodes/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/SFML/SFML/issues/comments/9282873","html_url":"https://github.com/SFML/SFML/issues/290#issuecomment-9282873","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/SFML/SFML/issues/290","id":9282873,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDkyODI4NzM=","user":{"login":"mantognini","id":693483,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY5MzQ4Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/693483?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mantognini","html_url":"https://github.com/mantognini","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mantognini/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mantognini/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mantognini/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mantognini/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mantognini/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mantognini/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mantognini/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mantognini/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mantognini/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2012-10-09T22:42:49Z","updated_at":"2012-10-09T22:42:49Z","body":">
