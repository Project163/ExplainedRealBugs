this topic http://en.sfml-dev.org/forums/index.php?topic=17492.0 and this one : http://en.sfml-dev.org/forums/index.php?topic=17489\n\nI'm writing this request to allow the user the possibility to choose within cmake which modules to configure for compilation.\n\nThis feature is usefull if one is wanting to use a submodule on a targeted system that is not allowing another module to be compiled on/for.\n\nIn my case, i am using sfml-network (and its dependency sfml-system) only, indeed the target system is a openwrt router which cannot run any X11/opengl/whatever is needed by others sfml modules.\n\nthanks for the feedback.\n","closed_by":{"login":"mantognini","id":693483,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY5MzQ4Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/693483?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mantognini","html_url":"https://github.com/mantognini","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mantognini/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mantognini/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mantognini/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mantognini/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mantognini/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mantognini/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mantognini/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mantognini/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mantognini/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/SFML/SFML/issues/798/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/SFML/SFML/issues/798/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
