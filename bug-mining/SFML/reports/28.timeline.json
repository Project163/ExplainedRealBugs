that when `SetPlayingOffset()` stops the stream, the call to `Thread.Wait()` never returns.\nHowever it should return at some point; it's just slow in this case because of `sf::Sleep(sf::Seconds(5))`.\n\nPlatform: GNU/Linux, SFML commit #e7256e3324a196bb1432786c678f195c9ffb982b.\n\nFor the record, I encountered this bug while adding streaming to my Python binding.\nCurrently the API is very slow, and I was wondering why my program hangs when testing seeking with `SetPlayingOffset()`.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/SFML/SFML/issues/180/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/SFML/SFML/issues/180/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/SFML/SFML/issues/comments/4503632","html_url":"https://github.com/SFML/SFML/issues/30#issuecomment-4503632","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/SFML/SFML/issues/30","id":4503632,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ1MDM2MzI=","user":{"login":"yadurajiv","id":283683,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4MzY4Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/283683?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yadurajiv","html_url":"https://github.com/yadurajiv","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yadurajiv/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yadurajiv/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yadurajiv/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yadurajiv/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yadurajiv/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yadurajiv/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yadurajiv/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yadurajiv/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yadurajiv/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2012-03-14T17:43:35Z","updated_at":"2012-03-14T17:43:35Z","body":"If
