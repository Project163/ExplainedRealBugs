tell, the source of the problem is [strings returned by xcb_get_property_value are not null terminated](http://xcb.freedesktop.org/XcbRationale/).  By chance there is a '\\0' character after the string, but it lies outside the allocated structure.  A humorous side effect of this is AddressSanatizer only detects the overflow if the length of window manager's name is a multiple of 4 (because otherwise the terminating null character would fall within an allocated word of memory.)\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/SFML/SFML/issues/918/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/SFML/SFML/issues/918/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"actor":{"login":"fallahn","id":5619252,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2MTkyNTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5619252?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fallahn","html_url":"https://github.com/fallahn","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fallahn/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fallahn/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fallahn/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fallahn/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fallahn/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fallahn/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fallahn/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fallahn/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fallahn/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-12-08T15:39:43Z","updated_at":"2015-12-08T15:39:43Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/SFML/SFML/issues/1016","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/SFML/SFML","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/SFML/SFML/issues/1016/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/SFML/SFML/issues/1016/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/SFML/SFML/issues/1016/events","html_url":"https://github.com/SFML/SFML/issues/1016","id":121033644,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWUxMjEwMzM2NDQ=","number":1016,"title":"Fail

rw.create(reinterpret_cast<sf::WindowHandle>(form.native_handle()));\n\n    form.events().destroy([&rw]() { rw.close(); });\n    form.events().focus([&rw]() {rw.clear(sf::Color(50, 60, 50)); rw.display(); });\n\n    form.show();\n    nana::exec();\n\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\nThe above works fine on Windows using VS2015 (as does my actual use case).\n\nPossibly related is the X11 example which builds and runs, but closing the window leaves the SFML windows behind:\n![](http://djfallen.com/images/x11.png)\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/SFML/SFML/issues/1016/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/SFML/SFML/issues/1016/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"actor":{"login":"EKashpersky","id":10428637,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNDI4NjM3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10428637?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/EKashpersky","html_url":"https://github.com/EKashpersky","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EKashpersky/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EKashpersky/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EKashpersky/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EKashpersky/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EKashpersky/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EKashpersky/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EKashpersky/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EKashpersky/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EKashpersky/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-11-27T10:22:45Z","updated_at":"2018-11-27T10:22:45Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/SFML/SFML/issues/1521","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/SFML/SFML","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/SFML/SFML/issues/1521/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/SFML/SFML/issues/1521/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/SFML/SFML/issues/1521/events","html_url":"https://github.com/SFML/SFML/issues/1521","id":384722169,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWUzODQ3MjIxNjk=","number":1521,"title":"Problem

in 2015, I created several forum threads around the topic of error handling/reporting:\r\n* [to promote the use of assertions](https://en.sfml-dev.org/forums/index.php?topic=19427)\r\n* [to discuss logging with `sf::err()`](https://en.sfml-dev.org/forums/index.php?topic=19282)\r\n\r\nSome discussions around the topic date back to 2011 and 2013:\r\n* [why SFML didn't use exceptions](https://en.sfml-dev.org/forums/index.php?topic=5228)\r\n* [Exceptions in SFML 3?](https://en.sfml-dev.org/forums/index.php?topic=13240)\r\n\r\nThese are quite interesting, already to understand historic context and how SFML 1 and 2 evolved to be without exceptions.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n# Error handling in SFML 3\r\n\r\nNow the year is 2022, a lot has changed, and at last we have the option to introduce breaking changes and redesign the API for better userfriendlyness. Handling errors is an important topic, and there are different options to tackle them in SFML 3. I'll jump right into them:\r\n\r\n1. **Boolean return types**\r\n   E.g. SFML 2 `sf::Image::loadFromFile()`\r\n   * ✔️ Simple.\r\n   * ✔️ Easy to port to bindings.\r\n   * :x: Can be forgotten (`[[nodiscard]]` is needed on every single method).\r\n   * ❌ Needs separate output parameters.\r\n   * ❌ No way to transport error messages, needs `sf::err()` side channel.\r\n\r\n2. **Optionals**\r\n   Basically all the disadvantages of `bool` except no need for output parameters.\r\n   * ✔️ Simple to understand and document.\r\n   * ✔️ Easy to port to bindings.\r\n   * :x: Can be forgotten (`[[nodiscard]]` is needed on every single method).\r\n   * ❌ No way to transport error messages.\r\n\r\n3. **Assertions**\r\n   Listed for completeness, but they are not really a solution for runtime errors. But we might want to use them more often to complement other error mechanisms in the case of logic errors.\r\n   * ✔️ Immediate breakpoint, must be fixed.\r\n   * ✔️ No runtime overhead in release.\r\n   * :x: Only useful for errors that are bugs (not loading files etc).\r\n   * ❌ Do not allow the user to be lenient about certain errors.\r\n\r\n5. **Exceptions**\r\n   * ✔️ User cannot ignore them.\r\n   * ✔️ Automatically propagate upward.\r\n   * ✔️ Can be polymorphic, allowing automatic fallbacks and higher-level handling.\r\n   * ✔️ Can theoretically transport extra data beyond message, although rarely done in practice.\r\n   * ✔️ Can be used in constructors.\r\n   * ❌ Hard to document and follow, especially once multiple layers/callbacks/virtual functions are involved.\r\n   * ❌ Exception safety can be hard to achieve, and we need to enter the whole `noexcept` rabbit hole.   \r\n   * ❌ Need verbose `try/catch` block even in situations where the user explicitly wants to ignore them.\r\n   * ❌ Not easy to map to bindings, especially due to polymorphism.\r\n   * ❌ Small runtime overhead (more or less depending on exception mechanism).\r\n   \r\n4. **Result type**\r\n    Inspired by [`std::expected`](https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2021/p0323r10.html) proposal or Rust's [`Result` type](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/result/index.html). \r\n    Basically `std::variant<T, E>` but with a highly specialized API.\r\n   * ✔️ User cannot forget them (`[[nodiscard]]` can be declared directly on the type).\r\n   * ✔️ User can however explicitly and concisely ignore them (e.g. with `(void)` or an `ignore()` method).\r\n   * ✔️ Allow to transport arbitrary data as part of the error (e.g. an enum, message, context info).\r\n   * ✔️ Function signature makes immediately obvious which methods can fail, and how they can do so -- users are not surprised by unexpected errors and cannot miss any documentation.\r\n   * ❌ No automatic propagation (could probably be made somewhat ergonomic as a library solution).\r\n   * ❌ Require static factory functions such as `Image::fromFile()`, no constructor support (if this is truly a disadvantage).\r\n   * ❌ Non-polymorphic unless explicitly designed.\r\n   * ❌ Requires either custom-built type for SFML or use of an established library.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/SFML/SFML/issues/2139/reactions","total_count":10,"+1":10,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/SFML/SFML/issues/2139/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"actor":{"login":"vittorioromeo","id":918661,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkxODY2MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/918661?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vittorioromeo","html_url":"https://github.com/vittorioromeo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vittorioromeo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vittorioromeo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vittorioromeo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vittorioromeo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vittorioromeo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vittorioromeo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vittorioromeo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vittorioromeo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vittorioromeo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-06-08T23:01:38Z","updated_at":"2024-06-08T23:01:38Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/SFML/SFML/issues/3079","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/SFML/SFML","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/SFML/SFML/issues/3079/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/SFML/SFML/issues/3079/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/SFML/SFML/issues/3079/events","html_url":"https://github.com/SFML/SFML/issues/3079","id":2340853325,"node_id":"I_kwDOABdDzM6LhpZN","number":3079,"title":"`SoundEffects.cpp`

[Image](https://www.sfml-dev.org/documentation/2.6.2/classsf_1_1Image.php) & \timage, const [IntRect](https://www.sfml-dev.org/documentation/2.6.2/classsf_1_1Rect.php) & \tarea = [IntRect](https://www.sfml-dev.org/documentation/2.6.2/classsf_1_1Rect.php)() )\r\n\r\nI am running the build with thread sanitizer and I have reason to believe that this function violates the memory if area goes out of bounds. As I get sanitizer issue 100% of a time after I call this function. \r\n\r\nHere I have an image. with the size 3750 x 150\r\nand I load animation frames into textures of 150 x 150\r\n\r\n```\r\nif (!tex->loadFromImage(image, false, sf::IntRect(sf::Vector2((int)(0 + x), 0), sf::Vector2((int)_w, (int)_w))))\r\n            throw gui::exception() << \"ResourcesSFML::_loadTextures:: Failed to load texture: \" + _path.string();\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\nloading starts\r\nimage size 3750 x 150\r\nload 0 to 150\r\n...\r\nload 3600 to 3750\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo if I change IntRect to be (x, 0) (_w - 1, _w -1)  I get no sanitizer issue. So I assume there still was some memory violation trying to load from image on the bounds. \r\n\r\n\r\nHere is the sanitizer issue:\r\n\r\n```\r\nWARNING: ThreadSanitizer: data race (pid=7816)\r\n  Write of size 8 at 0x729400009948 by main thread (mutexes: write M0):\r\n    #0 memset ../../../../src/libsanitizer/sanitizer_common/sanitizer_common_interceptors_memintrinsics.inc:87 (libtsan.so.2+0x8ba90) (BuildId: 38097064631f7912bd33117a9c83d08b42e15571)\r\n    #1 memset ../../../../src/libsanitizer/sanitizer_common/sanitizer_common_interceptors_memintrinsics.inc:85 (libtsan.so.2+0x8ba90)\r\n    #2 <null> <null> (iris_dri.so+0xcba1ec) (BuildId: 1164c48e8f4333b4c99b65095cf99839d28361fe)\r\n    #3 _loadAnimatedSprite(std::__cxx11::basic_string<char, std::char_traits<char>, std::allocator<char> > const&, ResourceOptions const&) Resources.cpp:16 (SFML+0x5ded9a)\r\n\r\n  Previous write of size 8 at 0x729400009948 by thread T4:\r\n    #0 memset ../../../../src/libsanitizer/sanitizer_common/sanitizer_common_interceptors_memintrinsics.inc:87 (libtsan.so.2+0x8ba90) (BuildId: 38097064631f7912bd33117a9c83d08b42e15571)\r\n    #1 memset ../../../../src/libsanitizer/sanitizer_common/sanitizer_common_interceptors_memintrinsics.inc:85 (libtsan.so.2+0x8ba90)\r\n    #2 <null> <null> (iris_dri.so+0xcba1ec) (BuildId: 1164c48e8f4333b4c99b65095cf99839d28361fe)\r\n```\n\n### Your Environment\n\n- OS / distro / window manager:   Ubuntu 24\r\n- SFML version:       d4ee28c441e42483eff0b16583eaec6ecf719056\r\n- Compiler / toolchain:   GCC 14 / CLANG\r\n- Special compiler / CMake flags:  -fsanitize=thread\r\n\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\nSorry I don't have time to produce the minimum example. Also the issue is not easy to trigger as it requires some memory work after the function under sanitizer mode to even notice the problem. \r\n\r\nBut generally just load a bunch of images with this function \r\n\r\n```\r\nstd::vector<spSfmlTexture> textures;\r\nsf::Image image = load(_path);\r\nfor (size_t x = 0; x < image.getSize().x; x += _w)\r\n    {\r\n        std::shared_pointer<sf::Texture> tex = std::make_shared<sf::Texture>();\r\n        tex->setSmooth(true);\r\n        if (!tex->loadFromImage(image, false, sf::IntRect(sf::Vector2((int)(0 + x), 0), sf::Vector2((int)_w, (int)_w))))\r\n            throw 1;\r\n        textures.emplace_back(tex);\r\n    }\r\nreturn textures;\r\n```\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nNo Sanitizer issues\n\n### Actual behavior\n\nSanitizer report memory access data race after loading textures from image class at exact image bounds.
