a post about it before realizing that submitting it here might be better: http://www.sfml-dev.org/forum/viewtopic.php?p=43067#43067\n\nLong story short, in the Mac OS X SFML2 Joystick implementation currently only processes HID game controllers that are designated as \"Generic Desktop Joystick\" by their driver, ones designated as \"Generic Desktop GamePad\" (such as the wired xbox 360 controller with open source mac driver, are not detected.\n\nFix: filter HID devices not only by Joystick, but also add Gamepad (IE.  kHIDUsage_GD_Joystick and kHIDUsage_GD_Gamepad )\n","closed_by":{"login":"mantognini","id":693483,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY5MzQ4Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/693483?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mantognini","html_url":"https://github.com/mantognini","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mantognini/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mantognini/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mantognini/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mantognini/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mantognini/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mantognini/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mantognini/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mantognini/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mantognini/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/SFML/SFML/issues/138/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/SFML/SFML/issues/138/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
