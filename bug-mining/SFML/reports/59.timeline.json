#1625.\r\n\r\nSince the FBO `RenderTexture` implementation makes use of existing contexts where it can in order to reduce context switching, `RenderTexture`s will almost always live in the same context as the context owning `RenderTarget`s such as `sf::RenderWindow`. This also means that they will share the same OpenGL state. The `glStatesSet` flag that tracks whether OpenGL states have been set or not does so per-`RenderTarget`.\r\n\r\nWhen (re-)creating a context the initial states required by SFML will have to be set up. This is normally done in `sf::RenderTarget::initialize()` when `.create()` is called on the corresponding object. The problem is that `sf::RenderTarget::initialize()` is not called on the FBO `RenderTexture`s living on the same context as the `RenderTarget` on which `.create()` was called.\r\n\r\nAs shown in #1625, drawing to an FBO `RenderTexture` directly after the window owning its context has been re-created will not reset the OpenGL states since the flag was never reset.\r\n\r\nThis patch forces OpenGL states to be reset whenever the `RenderTarget` tracking detects a new context in which nothing has been activated before, regardless of whether it is a `RenderWindow` or a `RenderTexture`.\r\n\r\nTest with code provided in

to @dogunbound for this list from PR #186. I'm moving this list out to its own issue so we can track these changes while we incrementally merge PRs.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nBasically, we need to slowly go through EVERY pull request and see if any change needs to be made and make those changes. If there aren't any changes needed for a specific pull request, mark it as complete.\r\ntodo list:\r\n- [x] https://github.com/SFML/SFML/pull/1477\r\n- [x] https://github.com/SFML/SFML/pull/1509\r\n-
