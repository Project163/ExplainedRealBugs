and .jpg file extensions are interchangeable, yet SFML does not seem to support saving .jpeg extensions. Noteworthy in this code segment https://github.com/SFML/SFML/blob/master/src/SFML/Graphics/ImageLoader.cpp#L253 SFML doesn't check for a .jpeg extension. I would like to propose a minor bugfix for simply allowing files with a .jpeg extension to be saved in the exact same manner as a .jpg\n","closed_by":{"login":"Bromeon","id":708488,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcwODQ4OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/708488?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bromeon","html_url":"https://github.com/Bromeon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bromeon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bromeon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bromeon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bromeon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bromeon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bromeon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bromeon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bromeon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bromeon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/SFML/SFML/issues/929/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/SFML/SFML/issues/929/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
