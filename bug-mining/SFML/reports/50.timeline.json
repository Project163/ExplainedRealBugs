I couldn't change the resolution for borderless, windowed or fullscreen modes. After trying out different display configurations in my Desktop Environment, we tried to see what was SFML returning when Naezith's game called **getFullscreenModes**. We compiled SFML from the source code and ran a [sample code](https://gist.github.com/Yengas/ab23e1e68f30c01fd8b0cdf911899015). The sample application prints out the fullscreen modes returned by the SFML lib. After running the application, it prints out my current desktop resolution 7 times, with the exact same width and height.\r\n\r\nSo if i disable my second monitor and run the sample application i get this;\r\n```\r\nTotal size of fullscreen modes: 7\r\n1920x1080 # x7 times\r\n```\r\nWith the second monitor enabled;\r\n```\r\nTotal size of fullscreen modes: 7\r\n3840x1080 # x7 times\r\n```\r\n\r\nSFML Version: **git c43b5991afe815ef92a812d67f8af12b0143adfd**\r\nG++: **g++ (Ubuntu 5.4.1-2ubuntu1~16.04) 5.4.1 20160904**\r\nLinux: **Linux berserk 4.4.0-77-generic #98-Ubuntu SMP Wed Apr 26 08:34:02 UTC 2017 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux**\r\nLinux Distro: **Ubuntu 16.04.2 LTS**\r\nGraphics Card: **Nvidia GTX 950M**\r\nNVIDIA Driver Version: **381.09**\r\n\r\nAlso, we had to build the SFML according to this [comment on stackoverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/a/39607844), it didn't work otherwise.

user of my game reported it. \r\nI reproduced the problem. The most annoying thing is that the monitor stays off after the application closed and windows are rearranged.\r\n\r\nAfter some investigation, I found that XRRSetCrtcConfig should be used instead of XRRSetScreenConfig.\r\n\r\nI gave it a try (https://github.com/bloodsword/SFML/tree/dual-monitor-fix).\r\nIt's not shutting down the screen anymore, but some WM (Cinnamon and Unity at least) do not switch the window to fullscreen when there are 2 monitors. \r\nUbuntu WM was already suffering this problem without the fix, I guess it's the issue #1224. \r\nI have a fix for this issue but it's quite ugly, I will try to post it soon.\r\n\r\nTo use the mouse in the second screen, you need to alt+tab. \r\nThis behavior suits my game, since screen edges are used to move the camera.\r\nBut I don't really understand why.\r\n\r\nHere are some useful links :\r\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/2w8ahe/changing_resolutions_for_fullscreen_in_x11_linux\r\nhttps://sourcecodebrowser.com/libxrandr/1.2.3/_xrandr_8h.html\r\n","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/SFML/SFML/issues/comments/306059893/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"bloodsword","id":1052586,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNTI1ODY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1052586?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bloodsword","html_url":"https://github.com/bloodsword","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bloodsword/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bloodsword/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bloodsword/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bloodsword/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bloodsword/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bloodsword/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bloodsword/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bloodsword/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bloodsword/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/SFML/SFML/issues/comments/306076626","html_url":"https://github.com/SFML/SFML/issues/1226#issuecomment-306076626","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/SFML/SFML/issues/1226","id":306076626,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMwNjA3NjYyNg==","user":{"login":"eXpl0it3r","id":920861,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyMDg2MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/920861?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/eXpl0it3r","html_url":"https://github.com/eXpl0it3r","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eXpl0it3r/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eXpl0it3r/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eXpl0it3r/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eXpl0it3r/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eXpl0it3r/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eXpl0it3r/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eXpl0it3r/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eXpl0it3r/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eXpl0it3r/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-06-05T00:06:02Z","updated_at":"2017-06-05T00:06:02Z","body":"@bloodsword Feel free to open a pull request.
