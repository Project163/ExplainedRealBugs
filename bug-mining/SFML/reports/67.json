The app does not crash and works fully, there is just this annoying error + \"Failed to activate the window's context\" spam. If you also add antialiasing (which isn't supported on OpenGL ES afaik), the app also does not crash, you just get a black screen (common OpenGL stuff). Also for some reason when you set antialiasing to 1, it will say that it created version 0.0 and antialiasing x2.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/54750550/217073589-682a770c-a6ac-4d63-ada0-f0df40dad6fc.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n## Your environment\r\n\r\nAndroid Studio 2022.1.1 on Windows 10\r\nSFML 2.6.x branch\r\nUsed CMake, Ninja, Android NDK 25\r\n\r\n## Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\n```cpp\r\n#include <SFML/Graphics.hpp>\r\n\r\nint main()\r\n{\r\n    sf::RenderWindow window(sf::VideoMode::getDesktopMode(), \"App\", sf::Style::Fullscreen, sf::ContextSettings(0, 0, 2));\r\n    window.setFramerateLimit(60);\r\n\r\n    while (window.isOpen())\r\n    {\r\n        for (sf::Event event; window.pollEvent(event);)\r\n        {\r\n            if (event.type == sf::Event::Closed)\r\n                window.close();\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        window.clear();\r\n        window.display();\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Expected behavior\r\n\r\nIt should create a valid OpenGL context.\r\n\r\n## Actual behavior\r\n\r\nLogs show an error +\"Failed to activate the window's context\" spam.
