I'm leaning more towards the bug on the WM side since on all the systems/WMs I tested, the string is always null-terminated.\n\nWe could still add this check for safety reasons though, but the question now is what to do with all the other strings that are queried in the code.

tell, the source of the problem is [strings returned by xcb_get_property_value are not null terminated](http://xcb.freedesktop.org/XcbRationale/).  By chance there is a '\\0' character after the string, but it lies outside the allocated structure.  A humorous side effect of this is AddressSanatizer only detects the overflow if the length of window manager's name is a multiple of 4 (because otherwise the terminating null character would fall within an allocated word of memory.)\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/SFML/SFML/issues/918/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/SFML/SFML/issues/918/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
