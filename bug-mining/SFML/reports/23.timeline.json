why doesn't setting the string check for string equality like setting the color/style/character size/font?\n\nProbably because comparing strings is (depending on string length) much slower than comparing integers or pointers.\n\n>  if I update a sf::Text with a string that rarely changes\n\nThis, on the other hand, seems to be far more likely than updating with a color/style/character size/font that rarely changes, so i guess the checks currently done hardly ever prevent a call to `updateGemoetry()` whereas a check in `setString()` would probably do -- at the cost of an expensive check.\n\nMaybe the checks should be removed altogether, simplifying the code and even saving some instructions for the (very probably) most common use cases.\n","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/SFML/SFML/issues/comments/19871585/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"Oberon00","id":849039,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg0OTAzOQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/849039?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Oberon00","html_url":"https://github.com/Oberon00","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Oberon00/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Oberon00/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Oberon00/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Oberon00/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Oberon00/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Oberon00/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Oberon00/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Oberon00/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Oberon00/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":53731530,"node_id":"MDEzOkFzc2lnbmVkRXZlbnQ1MzczMTUzMA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/SFML/SFML/issues/events/53731530","actor":{"login":"ghost","id":10137,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMTM3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10137?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost","html_url":"https://github.com/ghost","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"assigned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2013-06-23T10:50:42Z","assignee":{"login":"LaurentGomila","id":245489,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NTQ4OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/245489?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/LaurentGomila","html_url":"https://github.com/LaurentGomila","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LaurentGomila/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LaurentGomila/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LaurentGomila/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LaurentGomila/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LaurentGomila/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LaurentGomila/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LaurentGomila/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LaurentGomila/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LaurentGomila/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/SFML/SFML/issues/comments/19879520","html_url":"https://github.com/SFML/SFML/issues/413#issuecomment-19879520","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/SFML/SFML/issues/413","id":19879520,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE5ODc5NTIw","user":{"login":"MarioLiebisch","id":1854245,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NTQyNDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1854245?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MarioLiebisch","html_url":"https://github.com/MarioLiebisch","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MarioLiebisch/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MarioLiebisch/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MarioLiebisch/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MarioLiebisch/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MarioLiebisch/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MarioLiebisch/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MarioLiebisch/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MarioLiebisch/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MarioLiebisch/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2013-06-23T19:27:00Z","updated_at":"2013-06-23T19:27:00Z","body":"Actually,
