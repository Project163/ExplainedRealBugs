Between the call to stbi_load and stbi_failure_reason another thread could be in the middle of writing to the failure reason global variable that stb uses, causing a crash in the error printing.\r\nA crash from this happens occasionally in my program and since its a thread race condition I cant provide a reliable code example to reproduce the issue, but here is what `valgrind --tool=helgrind` complains about:\r\n```\r\n 542 ==860571== Possible data race during write of size 8 at 0x4916540 by thread #7\r\n 543 ==860571== Locks held: none\r\n 559 ==860571==    at 0x48AD188: stbi__err(char const*) (stb_image.h:841)\r\n 560 ==860571==    by 0x48ADD97: stbi_load (stb_image.h:1135)\r\n 561 ==860571==    by 0x48CB8D7: sf::priv::ImageLoader::loadImageFromFile(std::__cxx11::basic_string<char, std::char_traits<char>, std::allocator<char> > const&, std::vector<unsigned char, std::allocator<unsigned char> >&, sf::Vector2<unsigned int>&) (ImageLoader     .cpp:104)\r\n 562 ==860571==    by 0x48ABD2F: sf::Image::loadFromFile(std::__cxx11::basic_string<char, std::char_traits<char>, std::allocator<char> > const&) (Image.cpp:125)\r\n```\r\nstb_image.h probably needs to be modified to use thread-safe error string to fix this issue","closed_by":{"login":"eXpl0it3r","id":920861,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyMDg2MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/920861?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/eXpl0it3r","html_url":"https://github.com/eXpl0it3r","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eXpl0it3r/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eXpl0it3r/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eXpl0it3r/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eXpl0it3r/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eXpl0it3r/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eXpl0it3r/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eXpl0it3r/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eXpl0it3r/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eXpl0it3r/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/SFML/SFML/issues/1711/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/SFML/SFML/issues/1711/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
