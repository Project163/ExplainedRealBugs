would definitely be good to know why OpenAL returns a value of zero. What I could find so far is [a forum thread](http://slick.ninjacave.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=4581) of the Slick2D Java Game Library. They have exactly the same problem. Line 38 and surroundings of their AudioImpl.java looks as follows:\n\n``` java\nint bytes = AL10.alGetBufferi(buffer, AL10.AL_SIZE);\nint bits = AL10.alGetBufferi(buffer, AL10.AL_BITS);\nint channels = AL10.alGetBufferi(buffer, AL10.AL_CHANNELS);\nint freq = AL10.alGetBufferi(buffer, AL10.AL_FREQUENCY);\n\nint samples = bytes / (bits / 8);\nlength = (samples / (float) freq) / channels;\n```\n\nIt seems like a format problem in the OGG file.\n\nHowever, I don't think a good solution is to just ignore this error with `operator?:`. Did you get an error message on the console? Do you happen to have a [reproducing example](http://en.sfml-dev.org/forums/index.php?topic=5559.msg36368#msg36368)?

(Specifically, it happened with NSF files.) I found out the source of the problem in my code as it came from a confusion between GME channels (read: instruments) and output channels (mono/stereo/etc.). Hardcoding 2-channel stereo in the call to sf::SoundStream::initialize() instead of wrongly using the instrument count made the problem disappear. NSF files have five instruments, so in the bogus code it initialized the soundstream with an odd number of channels, whereas most other formats supported by GME have an even number of instruments, which hid the issue until I grabbed some NSFs for testing.\n\nSo, it was basically a format problem which caused the problem to happen.
