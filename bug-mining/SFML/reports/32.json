started using google's address sanitizer and the Window constructor using a handle id results in an invalid read.\n\nHere is a minimal working example:\n\n``` c++\n#include <SFML/Graphics.hpp>\nint main()\n{\n  sf::RenderWindow w(0x36000a7);\n  return 0;\n}\n```\n\nCompiled with:\n\n```\nclang++ -fsanitize=address -Wall -Wextra -lsfml-graphics -o sanitizer sanitizer.cpp && ./sanitizer\n\n==17541==ERROR: AddressSanitizer: heap-buffer-overflow on address 0x60400001c600 at pc 0x0000004a9a57 bp 0x7ffcb4bf24e0 sp 0x7ffcb4bf1c98\nREAD of size 18 at 0x60400001c600 thread T0\n```\n\nIt seems that the window manager name retrived with xcb is not null terminated causing undefined behavior when calling `strlen` in the sf::String constructor from ewmhSupported().\n\nI wrote a possible fix here: https://github.com/kode9/SFML/commit/1efb5256bf8801b5c22583ae16422724e3f52bd5\n\nThe actual string length can be retrieved using `xcb_get_property_value_length`.\n\nTell me if you need more informations, or if I'm wrong :)\n\nCheers,\n","closed_by":{"login":"binary1248","id":949359,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk0OTM1OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/949359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/binary1248","html_url":"https://github.com/binary1248","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/binary1248/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/binary1248/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/binary1248/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/binary1248/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/binary1248/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/binary1248/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/binary1248/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/binary1248/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/binary1248/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/SFML/SFML/issues/892/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/SFML/SFML/issues/892/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
