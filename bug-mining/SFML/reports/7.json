It's as if it loses all it's current speed and has to re-accelerate again from 0.\n\nIn a situation where you compare the cursor's current position with the one it had the previous frame and then re-center it, you can only get a couple of pixels of movement each second (1-5 pixels in either direction, depending on how violently you move the mouse).\n\nFinding a way to position the cursor without causing it to decellerate completely seems to be the only solution.\n\nIn an attempt to not sound more confusing I'll just link to the thread I created about this in the forums: http://www.sfml-dev.org/forum/viewtopic.php?p=31550#31550\n","closed_by":{"login":"mantognini","id":693483,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY5MzQ4Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/693483?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mantognini","html_url":"https://github.com/mantognini","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mantognini/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mantognini/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mantognini/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mantognini/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mantognini/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mantognini/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mantognini/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mantognini/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mantognini/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/SFML/SFML/issues/46/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/SFML/SFML/issues/46/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
