However it's fine if I move it fast.\r\n\r\nI tried this with Dualshock 4 controller and Logitech F310 which has two modes, X (XInput) and D (Dualshock?), I tried both of them and it's same on those too.\r\n\r\nI tried this with @binary1248 's new DirectInput patch (https://github.com/SFML/SFML/pull/1326) and without it. Same problem exists.\r\n\r\nOne player also tried the same and approves.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, Windows Control Panel -> Set up USB Game controllers -> Properties does not have the same issue, maybe it's polling the current value instead of working with events.\r\n\r\nI already implemented XInput for my game. If I use an XInput emulator for these gamepads, Game's XInput library works fine. \r\n\r\nI am incredibly busy these days so I can't provide a code snippet but it's just the most basic pollEvent loop.\r\n\r\nWindows 10\r\nDualshock 4\r\nLogitech F310\r\ng++ (x86_64-posix-seh-rev1, Built by MinGW-W64 project) 7.2.0\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"eXpl0it3r","id":920861,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyMDg2MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/920861?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/eXpl0it3r","html_url":"https://github.com/eXpl0it3r","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eXpl0it3r/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eXpl0it3r/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eXpl0it3r/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eXpl0it3r/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eXpl0it3r/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eXpl0it3r/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eXpl0it3r/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eXpl0it3r/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eXpl0it3r/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/SFML/SFML/issues/1329/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/SFML/SFML/issues/1329/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
