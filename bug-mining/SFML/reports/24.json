an options menu I realized .setVerticalSyncEnabled() resets when .create() is called.\nI think this may be a bug, because for example setFramerateLimit doesnt reset at all\nBelow I provide small examples to show what I mean.\n\nthis is the code to show setFramerateLimit  doesn't reset (to \"unlimited\" FPS)  when create() is called http://codepad.org/XIIt4KkE\n\nThis is the code to show that setVerticalSyncEnabled does reset to false if create() is called\nhttp://codepad.org/cyjmnPqH\n\na simple fix is to set setVerticalSyncEnabled to true, every time you call .create(), like this:\n\n``` cpp\napp.create(VideoMode(800, 600, 32), \"SFML Test\");\napp.setVerticalSyncEnabled(true);\n```\n","closed_by":{"login":"Bromeon","id":708488,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcwODQ4OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/708488?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bromeon","html_url":"https://github.com/Bromeon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bromeon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bromeon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bromeon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bromeon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bromeon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bromeon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bromeon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bromeon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bromeon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/SFML/SFML/issues/371/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/SFML/SFML/issues/371/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
