I abandoned the Qt notion here to see if I could reproduce the unresponsive window via a Win32 window being made then passing the handle to SFML. Used some source from [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/learnwin32/your-first-windows-program) to make a Win32 window then passed the handle to SFML and noticed on 3.0.0 the window is totally unresponsive. When debugging I see we get trapped infinitely processing GL errors. Whereas on 2.6.2 we process a single error then report that. \r\n\r\nI presume a default Qt app redirects the stdout or is just a Win32 app so you can't see the stdout easily, that means you would never see the stream of GL errors being shouted by SFML. I also tried this by using glfw to create a window then passing the handle to SFML and get the same result. I have no clue _why_ this is happening but this is my leading theory. If someone wants to install Qt and verify this be my guest, but the fact the below example works fine with 2.6.2 but not 3.0.0 leads me to believe this might be the issue you're experiencing.\r\n\r\n```cpp\r\n#include <GLFW/glfw3.h>\r\n#define GLFW_EXPOSE_NATIVE_WIN32\r\n#include <GLFW/glfw3native.h>\r\n\r\nint main(void)\r\n{\r\n    GLFWwindow* window;\r\n\r\n    /* Initialize the library */\r\n    if (!glfwInit())\r\n        return -1;\r\n\r\n    /* Create a windowed mode window and its OpenGL context */\r\n    window = glfwCreateWindow(640, 480, \"Hello World\", NULL, NULL);\r\n    if (!window)\r\n    {\r\n        glfwTerminate();\r\n        return -1;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    sf::RenderWindow wind (glfwGetWin32Window(window));\r\n    \r\n    /* Make the window's context current */\r\n    glfwMakeContextCurrent(window);\r\n\r\n    /* Loop until the user closes the window */\r\n    while (!glfwWindowShouldClose(window))\r\n    {\r\n        /* Render here */\r\n        glClear(GL_COLOR_BUFFER_BIT);\r\n\r\n        /* Swap front and back buffers */\r\n        glfwSwapBuffers(window);\r\n\r\n        /* Poll for and process events */\r\n        glfwPollEvents();\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    glfwTerminate();\r\n    return 0;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe errors being constantly spat out on 3.0.0 were\r\n```\r\nAn internal OpenGL call failed in \"RenderWindow.cpp\"(113).\r\nExpression:\r\n   glGetIntegerv(GLEXT_GL_FRAMEBUFFER_BINDING, reinterpret_cast<GLint*>(&m_defaultFrameBuffer))\r\nError description:\r\n   GL_INVALID_OPERATION\r\n   The specified operation is not allowed in the current state.\r\n```\r\n\r\non 2.6.2 I get this singular output:\r\n```\r\nAn internal OpenGL call failed in RenderWindow.cpp(125).\r\nExpression:\r\n   glGetIntegerv(GLEXT_GL_FRAMEBUFFER_BINDING, reinterpret_cast<GLint*>(&m_defaultFrameBuffer))\r\nError description:\r\n   GL_INVALID_OPERATION\r\n   The specified operation is not allowed in the current state.\r\n\r\nFailed to set pixel format for device context: The pixel format is invalid.\r\nCannot create OpenGL context\r\n```\r\n\r\n@Wolfmyths if you attach a debugger and pause it during the unresponsiveness, you can confirm my findings by telling us if the debugger halts within SFML's code for processing GL errors (`glCheckError` function in SFML).","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/SFML/SFML/issues/comments/2566453475/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"Bambo-Borris","id":101207556,"node_id":"U_kgDOBghOBA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/101207556?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bambo-Borris","html_url":"https://github.com/Bambo-Borris","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bambo-Borris/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bambo-Borris/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bambo-Borris/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bambo-Borris/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bambo-Borris/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bambo-Borris/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bambo-Borris/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bambo-Borris/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bambo-Borris/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":15790405895,"node_id":"MEE_lADOABdDzM6kwHT1zwAAAAOtLnkH","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/SFML/SFML/issues/events/15790405895","actor":{"login":"Wolfmyths","id":118236986,"node_id":"U_kgDOBwwnOg","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/118236986?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Wolfmyths","html_url":"https://github.com/Wolfmyths","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Wolfmyths/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Wolfmyths/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Wolfmyths/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Wolfmyths/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Wolfmyths/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Wolfmyths/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Wolfmyths/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Wolfmyths/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Wolfmyths/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2024-12-31T13:28:04Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":15790405909,"node_id":"SE_lADOABdDzM6kwHT1zwAAAAOtLnkV","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/SFML/SFML/issues/events/15790405909","actor":{"login":"Wolfmyths","id":118236986,"node_id":"U_kgDOBwwnOg","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/118236986?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Wolfmyths","html_url":"https://github.com/Wolfmyths","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Wolfmyths/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Wolfmyths/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Wolfmyths/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Wolfmyths/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Wolfmyths/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Wolfmyths/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Wolfmyths/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Wolfmyths/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Wolfmyths/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2024-12-31T13:28:04Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/SFML/SFML/issues/comments/2566484090","html_url":"https://github.com/SFML/SFML/issues/3369#issuecomment-2566484090","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/SFML/SFML/issues/3369","id":2566484090,"node_id":"IC_kwDOABdDzM6Y-XB6","user":{"login":"eXpl0it3r","id":920861,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyMDg2MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/920861?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/eXpl0it3r","html_url":"https://github.com/eXpl0it3r","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eXpl0it3r/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eXpl0it3r/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eXpl0it3r/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eXpl0it3r/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eXpl0it3r/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eXpl0it3r/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eXpl0it3r/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eXpl0it3r/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eXpl0it3r/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-12-31T14:10:37Z","updated_at":"2024-12-31T14:10:37Z","body":"I

some digging and I have the answers we need for now. This is because we're trying to poll errors without a valid GL context. According to [this resource](https://www.khronos.org/opengl/wiki/OpenGL_Error): \r\n\r\n> Note: No OpenGL function call is valid when an [OpenGL Context](https://www.khronos.org/opengl/wiki/OpenGL_Context) is not made current. Depending on the platform, a call to [glGetError](https://www.khronos.org/opengl/wiki/GLAPI/glGetError) without having a context made current may crash or return any value, including indefinitely returning a valid OpenGL error code. So if you see an infinite loop in such a function, this is likely the reason why \r\n\r\nHaving taken a look through the code it seems the flow is : \r\n\r\n1. https://github.com/SFML/SFML/blob/3.0.0/src/SFML/Window/Window.cpp#L126 override of create on the `sf::Window`\r\n2. We then call https://github.com/SFML/SFML/blob/3.0.0/src/SFML/Window/WindowBase.cpp#L114 \r\n3. Then we call the initialize on `sf::WindowBase`, which calls `onCreate()` \r\n4. `onCreate` is an inherited method which `sf::RenderWindow` has a implemented which tries to do some GL stuff which checks for an error https://github.com/SFML/SFML/blob/7f1162dfea4969bc17417563ac55d93b72e84c1e/src/SFML/Graphics/RenderWindow.cpp#L109\r\n\r\nAll of that happens before the call to create the context here https://github.com/SFML/SFML/blob/3.0.0/src/SFML/Window/Window.cpp#L129 \r\n\r\nEdit:\r\nI tried making the context before we do the init as a potential line swap fix, it results in a crash since we need to have a valid owner window impl instance before we can create the context. Not sure how this all hangs together internally but maybe @vittorioromeo or @binary1248 have a better idea
