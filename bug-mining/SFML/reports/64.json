Subject of the issue\r\n\r\nFrom commit 4fcef893c9d67630ad6d9e9bbf2ee48a62f95eef onwards the following error appears in the terminal, presumably only on nvidia cards\r\n\r\nOpenGL extension SGIS_texture_edge_clamp unavailable\r\nArtifacts may occur along texture edges\r\nEnsure that hardware acceleration is enabled if available\r\n\r\n## Your environment\r\n\r\n* nvidia 3080 GPU, Ubuntu 20.04 (driver 460.39) and Windows 10 (driver 461.33)\r\n* GCC 9.3.0, Visual Studio 2019 \r\n\r\n## Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\nAny program making use of a texture\r\n\r\n```cpp\r\n#include <SFML/Graphics.hpp>\r\n\r\nint main()\r\n{\r\n    sf::RenderWindow window(sf::VideoMode(200, 200), \"SFML works!\");\r\n    sf::CircleShape shape(100.f);\r\n    shape.setFillColor(sf::Color::Green);\r\n\r\n    sf::RenderTexture T;\r\n    T.create(200, 200);\r\n\r\n   \r\n    while (window.isOpen())\r\n    {\r\n        sf::Event event;\r\n        while (window.pollEvent(event))\r\n        {\r\n            if (event.type == sf::Event::Closed)\r\n                window.close();\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        T.clear();\r\n        T.draw(shape);\r\n        T.display();\r\n\r\n        sf::Sprite spr;\r\n        spr.setTexture(T.getTexture());\r\n\r\n        window.clear();\r\n        window.draw(spr);\r\n        window.display();\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    return 0;\r\n}\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nI managed to get the error to go away by changing line 11988 in https://github.com/SFML/SFML/blob/master/extlibs/headers/glad/include/glad/gl.h from\r\n\r\n```cpp\r\n    SF_GLAD_GL_SGIS_texture_edge_clamp = sf_glad_gl_has_extension(version, exts, num_exts_i, exts_i, \"GL_SGIS_texture_edge_clamp\");\r\n```\r\nto it's old value\r\n\r\n```cpp\r\n    SF_GLAD_GL_SGIS_texture_edge_clamp = sf_glad_gl_has_extension(version, exts, num_exts_i, exts_i, \"GL_SGIS_texture_edge_clamp\") | sf_glad_gl_has_extension(version, exts, num_exts_i, exts_i, \"GL_EXT_texture_edge_clamp\");\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt looks like this an issue in the past which I'm assuming was manually fixed, https://github.com/SFML/SFML/issues/880. I'm assuming that when this file was regenerated the fix didn't get  carried over.
