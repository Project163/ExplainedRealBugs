[This line](https://github.com/SFML/SFML/blob/c43b5991afe815ef92a812d67f8af12b0143adfd/src/SFML/Window/Unix/WindowImplX11.cpp#L1397) returns false instead of true.\r\nPutting a cout at the start of WindowImplX11::processEvent however shows that the next event that gets handled is KeyPress and it has the exact xkey.time as the KeyRelease before it.\r\n\r\nJust creating a second window and destroying it is enough to cause this.\r\n``` c++\r\n#include <iostream>\r\n#include <SFML/Window.hpp>\r\n\r\nint main (int argc, char* argv[]) {\r\n    sf::Window window{{400, 300}, \"Window 1\"};\r\n\r\n    {\r\n        sf::Window window2{{400, 300}, \"Window 2\"};\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    while (window.isOpen()) {\r\n        sf::Event event;\r\n        while (window.pollEvent(event)) {\r\n            switch(event.type) {\r\n                case sf::Event::Closed:\r\n                    window.close();\r\n                case sf::Event::KeyPressed:\r\n                    std::cout << \"Key Pressed: \" << event.key.code << std::endl;\r\n                    break;\r\n                case sf::Event::KeyReleased:\r\n                    std::cout << \"Key Released: \" << event.key.code << std::endl;\r\n                    break;\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf the second window is not put in a separate scope, then the same behavior happens when its events are NOT polled. If an event loop is then added for the second window then the KeyRelease is correctly filtered again.\r\n\r\nI don't really know x11, but is there any chance that XPeekEvent is returning an event for the wrong window and thus does not find the KeyPress?\r\nEdit: Apparently yes. The windowEvent.xany.window and nextEvent.xany.window are not the same. So it looks like the windows that no longer exists still has a pending event.","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/SFML/SFML/issues/comments/299472716/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"texus","id":1461034,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0NjEwMzQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1461034?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/texus","html_url":"https://github.com/texus","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/texus/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/texus/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/texus/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/texus/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/texus/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/texus/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/texus/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/texus/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/texus/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/SFML/SFML/issues/comments/299501041","html_url":"https://github.com/SFML/SFML/issues/1223#issuecomment-299501041","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/SFML/SFML/issues/1223","id":299501041,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI5OTUwMTA0MQ==","user":{"login":"texus","id":1461034,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0NjEwMzQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1461034?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/texus","html_url":"https://github.com/texus","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/texus/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/texus/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/texus/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/texus/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/texus/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/texus/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/texus/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/texus/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/texus/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-05-05T15:46:40Z","updated_at":"2017-05-05T15:46:40Z","body":"I managed to fix it with the following patch:\r\n``` diff\r\ndiff --git a/src/SFML/Window/Unix/WindowImplX11.cpp b/src/SFML/Window/Unix/WindowImplX11.cpp\r\nindex 91086e14..6c39654d 100644\r\n--- a/src/SFML/Window/Unix/WindowImplX11.cpp\r\n+++ b/src/SFML/Window/Unix/WindowImplX11.cpp\r\n@@ -1392,21 +1392,26 @@ bool WindowImplX11::processEvent(XEvent& windowEvent)\r\n         XEvent nextEvent;\r\n         if (XPending(m_display))\r\n         {\r\n-            // Grab it but don't remove it from the queue, it still needs to be processed :)\r\n-            XPeekEvent(m_display, &nextEvent);\r\n-            if (nextEvent.type == KeyPress)\r\n+            // Grab the next event from the queue (we will have to put it back because it still needs to be processed)\r\n+            if (XCheckIfEvent(m_display, &nextEvent, &checkEvent, reinterpret_cast<XPointer>(m_window)))\r\n             {\r\n-                // Check if it is a duplicated event (same timestamp as the KeyRelease event)\r\n-                if ((nextEvent.xkey.keycode == windowEvent.xkey.keycode) &&\r\n-                    (nextEvent.xkey.time -

So I also had to add code to put the event back on the queue.\r\n\r\nSome other people should probably check it to make certain it doesn't break anything

Description\r\n\r\nThis is an attempt to fix broken keyboard events on X11 with IBus input method.\r\n\r\nWhat this PR fixes (hopefully):\r\n1. Avoid duplicated `KeyPressed` events.\r\n   This is an alternative to #1894 from which I took inspiration, but more robust by indexing the bitset with X11 keycodes instead of `sf::Keyboard::Key` enumeration.\r\n\r\n2. Fix events being in the wrong order, i.e. fixes #2191\r\n   I noticed that getting as many events as possible from X11 queue and only then processing them (behavior added in #1291) makes the input method filtering go wrong, especially when framerate is low.\r\n   Popping and processing events in order, with some contortions to handle key repeat events, seems to work just great.\r\n   There is a risk of reintroducing bug #1223, but I do not reproduce that bug when testing this present PR.\r\n\r\nWhat this PR does not fix, but improves a little bit:\r\n- `TextEntered` events coming slowly when framerate is low.\r\n  As far as I understand, when IBus input method is used and a key is pressed, SFML pops a `KeyPress` event from X11 events queue and notifies the input method about it through `XFilterEvent`. The input methods gives an answer with text after a tiny delay through another X11 `KeyPress` event, so it is available for SFML on the next frame. This delay is noticeable when framerate is low.\r\n   Before this PR, when holding a key down with a low framerate, I had one `TextEntered` event every two frames. Somehow with this PR, I get one `TextEntered` each frame. So the problem becomes less noticeable.\r\n   A workaround to avoid this delay could be to process events in a separate thread but that would add complexity and I am not sure X11 would not explode.\r\n\r\n## Tasks\r\n\r\n* [x] Tested on Linux\r\n* [ ] Get more people to test @Edgaru089 @Neko-Box-Coder\r\n\r\n## How to test this PR?\r\n\r\n### Test program\r\n\r\n```c++\r\n#include <iostream>\r\n#include <SFML/Graphics.hpp>\r\n\r\nint main(int argc, char* argv[])\r\n{\r\n    // usage: test <framerate> <keyRepeat>\r\n    const int framerate = 1 < argc ? std::atoi(argv[1]) : 60;\r\n    const bool keyRepeat = 2 < argc ? std::atoi(argv[2]) : true;\r\n\r\n    sf::Window window(sf::VideoMode(100, 100), \"Window\");\r\n\r\n    auto createWindow = [&] {\r\n        window.create(sf::VideoMode(100, 100), \"Window\");\r\n        window.setFramerateLimit(framerate);\r\n        window.setKeyRepeatEnabled(keyRepeat);\r\n    };\r\n    createWindow();\r\n\r\n    while (window.isOpen())\r\n    {\r\n        sf::Event event;\r\n        while (window.pollEvent(event))\r\n        {\r\n            if (event.type == sf::Event::Closed)\r\n                window.close();\r\n            else if (event.type == sf::Event::KeyPressed)\r\n            {\r\n                std::cout << \"Key Pressed: \" << event.key.code << std::endl;\r\n                if (event.key.code == sf::Keyboard::Key::Space)\r\n                    createWindow();\r\n            }\r\n            else if (event.type == sf::Event::KeyReleased)\r\n                std::cout << \"Key Released: \" << event.key.code << std::endl;\r\n            else if (event.type == sf::Event::TextEntered)\r\n            {\r\n                const auto utf8 = sf::String(event.text.unicode).toUtf8();\r\n                std::cout << \"Text Entered: \" << std::string(utf8.begin(), utf8.end()) << std::endl;\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        window.display();\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Building the test program\r\n\r\nSave the `main.cpp` file above in a directory along with the following `CMakeLists.txt` file:\r\n```cmake\r\ncmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.16)\r\nproject(test)\r\n\r\ninclude(FetchContent)\r\nFetchContent_Declare(SFML\r\n    GIT_REPOSITORY https://github.com/kimci86/SFML.git\r\n    GIT_TAG bugfix/x11_key_events)\r\nif(NOT sfml_POPULATED)\r\n  FetchContent_Populate(SFML)\r\n  add_subdirectory(${sfml_SOURCE_DIR} ${sfml_BINARY_DIR} EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL)\r\nendif()\r\n\r\nadd_executable(test main.cpp)\r\ntarget_link_libraries(test PRIVATE sfml-window)\r\ntarget_compile_features(test PRIVATE cxx_std_17)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen run those commands from the directory the files are saved in:\r\n```sh\r\ncmake -S . -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug\r\ncmake --build build\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Running the test program\r\n\r\nFrom the same directory:\r\n```sh\r\n# by default, running at 60 fps with key repeat enabled\r\nbuild/test\r\n# running at 20 fps with key repeat enabled\r\nbuild/test 20\r\n# running at 20 fps with key repeat disabled\r\nbuild/test 20 0\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Testing steps\r\n\r\nUsing the test program, with different framerates (first command line argument):\r\n- Check that a single `KeyPressed` event is generated when pressing a key for a short time.\r\n- Check that a single `KeyReleased` event is generated and comes after all the `KeyPressed` events when pressing a key for a long time.\r\n- With key repetition disabled (second command line argument set to 0), check that a long press generates the same events as a short press.\r\n  + Check that it behaves the same after recreating the window by pressing the space bar.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/SFML/SFML/issues/2242/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/SFML/SFML/issues/2242/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
