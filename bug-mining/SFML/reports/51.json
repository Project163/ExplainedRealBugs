I determined that the color format of the image I use is RGBA meanwhile the correct format for a window cursor is BGRA. I then inverted the colors through a loop that changes every pixel in the image and the problem was fixed.\r\n\r\nIn the documentation there's written that the required format is RGBA, but I find it wrong. I don't know if it's an issue related to how the Windows API manages cursors or if I'm totally wrong.\r\n\r\n## Your environment\r\n\r\n* Windows 10 x64 Version 10.0.17134 Build 17134\r\n* SFML from git master\r\n* Microsoft (R) C/C++ Optimizing Compiler Version 19.14.26433 for x64\r\n* No special compiler flags\r\n\r\n## Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\n```cpp\r\n#include <SFML/Graphics.hpp>\r\n\r\nint main()\r\n{\r\n    sf::RenderWindow window(sf::VideoMode(1280, 720), \"Minimal, complete and verifiable example\");\r\n    window.setFramerateLimit(60);\r\n\r\n    // Load the icon\r\n    sf::Image image;\r\n    sf::Cursor cursor;\r\n    if (!image.loadFromFile(\"icon.png\"))\r\n        return -1;\r\n    if (!cursor.loadFromPixels(image.getPixelsPtr(), image.getSize(), { 0, 0 }))\r\n        return -1;\r\n    window.setMouseCursor(cursor);\r\n\r\n    while (window.isOpen())\r\n    {\r\n        sf::Event event;\r\n        while (window.pollEvent(event))\r\n        {\r\n            if (event.type == sf::Event::Closed)\r\n                window.close();\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        window.clear();\r\n        window.display();\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Expected behavior\r\n\r\nThe window cursor should be displayed with the correct image colors.\r\n\r\n## Actual behavior\r\n\r\nThe cursor image appears as if the colors were negated.\r\n\r\n## Fix\r\n\r\n```cpp\r\n// Swap the color format from RGBA to BGRA\r\nfor (unsigned x = 0; x < image.getSize().x; ++x)\r\n{\r\n\tfor (unsigned y = 0; y < image.getSize().y; ++y)\r\n\t{\r\n\t\tsf::Color pixel = image.getPixel(x, y);\r\n\t\timage.setPixel(x, y, { pixel.b, pixel.g, pixel.r, pixel.a });\r\n\t}\r\n}\r\n```","closed_by":{"login":"eXpl0it3r","id":920861,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyMDg2MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/920861?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/eXpl0it3r","html_url":"https://github.com/eXpl0it3r","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eXpl0it3r/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eXpl0it3r/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eXpl0it3r/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eXpl0it3r/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eXpl0it3r/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eXpl0it3r/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eXpl0it3r/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eXpl0it3r/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eXpl0it3r/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/SFML/SFML/issues/1464/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/SFML/SFML/issues/1464/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
