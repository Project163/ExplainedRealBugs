seems like the vorbis implementation has been somewhat buggy for some time.\r\n\r\nAfter opening an ogg stream and reading its header information with `ov_info()`, in certain cases (certain files) the internal stream read position isn't properly reset back to the beginning. This causes a subsequent call to `ov_pcm_total()` to return a wrong total sample count. Reading in sample data using `ov_read()` based on this incorrect sample count will then return less samples than what was reported leading to the entire file failing to load. Explicitly resetting the stream read position back to the beginning of the file using `ov_raw_seek()` after calling `ov_info()` seems to work around this problem.\r\n\r\nAssuming that this bug will realistically never get fixed, I don't have any reservations about building in this workaround. Glancing over the vorbis issue tracker it is unlikely most reported bugs will ever get fixed.\r\n\r\nAll the information necessary to reproduce the bug and test this fix can be found in #3578.\r\n\r\nFixes #3578","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/SFML/SFML/issues/3579/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/SFML/SFML/issues/3579/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/SFML/SFML/issues/comments/3326252030","html_url":"https://github.com/SFML/SFML/issues/3578#issuecomment-3326252030","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/SFML/SFML/issues/3578","id":3326252030,"node_id":"IC_kwDOABdDzM7GQpP-","user":{"login":"binary1248","id":949359,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk0OTM1OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/949359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/binary1248","html_url":"https://github.com/binary1248","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/binary1248/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/binary1248/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/binary1248/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/binary1248/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/binary1248/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/binary1248/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/binary1248/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/binary1248/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/binary1248/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-09-24T02:56:53Z","updated_at":"2025-09-24T02:56:53Z","body":"SFML's audio implementation was rewritten for SFML 3. One of the many things that changed is that we don't use our own hand-rolled wav decoder any more. Since we are already using miniaudio for audio processing, we also use its decoders to perform decoding for us for the formats that it supports of which wav is one. The miniaudio wav decoder provides much better support for more formats than our hand-rolled implementation in SFML 2. I had no issue playing both wav files you provided with SFML 3.\n\nRegarding the ogg file: I could reproduce the bug in SFML 3. It turns out it is caused by the somewhat buggy vorbis reference implementation that we use for ogg decoding. A workaround has been provided in #3579, with it I can play both ogg files correctly using SFML 3. Feel free to give it a
