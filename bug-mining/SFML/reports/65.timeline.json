\r\n\r\nThanks for checking out the issue. I am recompiling OpenAL Soft to link it statically, so I am guessing the issue may require a specific OpenAL version or even configuration/backend for OpenAL. I have recently updated OpenAL to 1.21.1 and I have now rebuilt SFML from master to test this out again and it still seems to be happening for me.\r\n\r\nThe sleep call using the processing interval is not being reached anymore because SoundSource::getStatus() == Stopped when I remove the device, so CPU usage skyrockets. Removing this condition solves the problem, although the sound stream does not resume on its own when the device is reconnected, so this is not an ideal solution, I think either it should be able to reset itself or the thread should stop, but at least removing the condition resolves the CPU usage problem.\r\n\r\nMaybe the issue requires a more recent OpenAL version to occur, but it may also come from a specific OpenAL configuration option. I don't know if you officially support linking OpenAL statically or newer versions of OpenAL, so we can leave it at that. It's most likely related to the OpenAL version so if you update OpenAL soft for SFML in the future, the issue may be reproducible then.","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/SFML/SFML/issues/comments/1044788391/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"Biohazard90","id":5513441,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MTM0NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5513441?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Biohazard90","html_url":"https://github.com/Biohazard90","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Biohazard90/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Biohazard90/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Biohazard90/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Biohazard90/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Biohazard90/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Biohazard90/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Biohazard90/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Biohazard90/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Biohazard90/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":6100580943,"node_id":"MEE_lADOABdDzM49LxUwzwAAAAFrn3pP","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/SFML/SFML/issues/events/6100580943","actor":{"login":"binary1248","id":949359,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk0OTM1OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/949359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/binary1248","html_url":"https://github.com/binary1248","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/binary1248/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/binary1248/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/binary1248/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/binary1248/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/binary1248/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/binary1248/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/binary1248/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/binary1248/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/binary1248/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-02-18T16:25:19Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":6100580950,"node_id":"SE_lADOABdDzM49LxUwzwAAAAFrn3pW","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/SFML/SFML/issues/events/6100580950","actor":{"login":"binary1248","id":949359,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk0OTM1OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/949359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/binary1248","html_url":"https://github.com/binary1248","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/binary1248/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/binary1248/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/binary1248/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/binary1248/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/binary1248/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/binary1248/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/binary1248/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/binary1248/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/binary1248/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-02-18T16:25:19Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/SFML/SFML/issues/comments/1045580907","html_url":"https://github.com/SFML/SFML/issues/1831#issuecomment-1045580907","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/SFML/SFML/issues/1831","id":1045580907,"node_id":"IC_kwDOABdDzM4-Ukxr","user":{"login":"binary1248","id":949359,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk0OTM1OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/949359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/binary1248","html_url":"https://github.com/binary1248","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/binary1248/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/binary1248/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/binary1248/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/binary1248/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/binary1248/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/binary1248/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/binary1248/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/binary1248/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/binary1248/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-02-19T02:25:58Z","updated_at":"2022-02-19T02:25:58Z","body

#1831.\r\n\r\nIt is not uncommon that audio adapters are used that have a USB interface. When all audio adapters are no longer available on Windows, OpenAL will \"go crazy\". Most OpenAL function calls will cause an OpenAL error to be reported, and any queries will return unpredictable data.\r\n\r\nWhen running the sound example using an OpenAL DLL from the latest release (version 1.21.1) and disabling all audio adapters while music is playing, certain conditions in OpenAL could lead to the main loop in `SoundStream::streamData` never terminating and also never sleeping causing 100% CPU load on that thread.\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes this problem by forcibly terminating the loop if an OpenAL error is detected.\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n1. Build latest SFML with examples\r\n2. Replace the bundled openal32.dll with a DLL from https://openal-soft.org/openal-binaries/openal-soft-1.21.1-bin.zip (rename the DLL to openal32.dll)\r\n3. Run the sound example\r\n4. When the music is playing, disable all audio output devices in Windows\r\n5. If you are (un-)lucky you will end up in an infinite loop, if testing in debug, the console will get flooded so fast with error messages that the program might end up crashing\r\n6. If you can't reproduce the problem, keep repeating steps 3 and 4 until it

Thank you! I took some attempts to test your PR but unfortunately it doesn't solve the issue on my current system, even when I use the official 1.21.1 OpenAL release and replace the headers, lib and DLL shipped with SFML with the official builds provided by the OpenAL developers.\r\n\r\nFor some reason, contrary to what was happening when I opened this issue, I'm not getting any errors anymore. What I'm experiencing now is solely that SoundSource::getStatus() returns Stopped, but no errors are being generated.\r\n\r\nI can't pin point which change on my end could have led to this change in behavior. I don't have the same dedicated sound card anymore that I was using while opening this issue, but I cannot reproduce the OpenAL error code with any of the other devices currently available to me, so it seems unlikely to be related to that.\r\n\r\nDepending on how you wish to proceed, please let me know if I can help test or check out anything else. Concerning myself, I will continue by just removing the condition before sleep() is called for the time being.","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/SFML/SFML/issues/comments/1047154590/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"Biohazard90","id":5513441,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MTM0NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5513441?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Biohazard90","html_url":"https://github.com/Biohazard90","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Biohazard90/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Biohazard90/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Biohazard90/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Biohazard90/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Biohazard90/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Biohazard90/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Biohazard90/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Biohazard90/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Biohazard90/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":6113548179,"node_id":"MEE_lADOABdDzM49LxUwzwAAAAFsZVeT","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/SFML/SFML/issues/events/6113548179","actor":{"login":"binary1248","id":949359,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk0OTM1OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/949359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/binary1248","html_url":"https://github.com/binary1248","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/binary1248/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/binary1248/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/binary1248/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/binary1248/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/binary1248/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/binary1248/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/binary1248/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/binary1248/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/binary1248/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-02-21T18:57:26Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":6113548186,"node_id":"SE_lADOABdDzM49LxUwzwAAAAFsZVea","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/SFML/SFML/issues/events/6113548186","actor":{"login":"binary1248","id":949359,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk0OTM1OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/949359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/binary1248","html_url":"https://github.com/binary1248","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/binary1248/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/binary1248/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/binary1248/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/binary1248/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/binary1248/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/binary1248/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/binary1248/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/binary1248/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/binary1248/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-02-21T18:57:26Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":6221858429,"node_id":"REFE_lADOABdDzM49LxUwzwAAAAFy2gZ9","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/SFML/SFML/issues/events/6221858429","actor":{"login":"binary1248","id":949359,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk0OTM1OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/949359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/binary1248","html_url":"https://github.com/binary1248","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/binary1248/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/binary1248/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/binary1248/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/binary1248/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/binary1248/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/binary1248/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/binary1248/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/binary1248/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/binary1248/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"1988c040f66f348c820e274753b4565fd8f0cf12","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/SFML/SFML/commits/1988c040f66f348c820e274753b4565fd8f0cf12","created_at":"2022-03-11T01
