creating an `sf::RenderWindow` under iOS `getSize()` returns 640 by 960 (on an iPhone 4S at least running in the simulator). This size matches the pixel unit size of what's expected according to [the technical specs for the iPhone 4S](https://www.apple.com/lae/iphone-4s/specs/).\n\nBut after changing the device's orientation (rotating the device left or right) a `Resized` event is generated that gives width and height values that are a factor of two larger than the original size. This factor of two, is the value of the SFML iOS application delegate's `backingScaleFactor` variable (for this device) and it's being re-applied in the `deviceOrientationDidChange` method (in `sfml-window/ios/SFAppDelegate.mm`) to the size returned from `self.sfWindow->getSize()` (which already factors this value in).\n","closed_by":{"login":"eXpl0it3r","id":920861,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyMDg2MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/920861?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/eXpl0it3r","html_url":"https://github.com/eXpl0it3r","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eXpl0it3r/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eXpl0it3r/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eXpl0it3r/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eXpl0it3r/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eXpl0it3r/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eXpl0it3r/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eXpl0it3r/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eXpl0it3r/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eXpl0it3r/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/SFML/SFML/issues/1049/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/SFML/SFML/issues/1049/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
