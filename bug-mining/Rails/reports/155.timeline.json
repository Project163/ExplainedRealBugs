Motivation / Background\r\n\r\nFixes #53435\r\n\r\nThis Pull Request has been created because values returned from the databases need to be deserialized as they may use a different format, such as PostgreSQL bytea \"hex\" format.\r\n\r\n### Detail\r\n\r\nThis Pull Request replaces `#write_from_user` with `#write_from_database` when assigning the auto populated values returned by the database.\r\n\r\n### Additional information\r\n\r\nI don't like the fact that we access `@attributes` directly, but `#reload` does it too and it's the simplest solution.\r\n\r\nAlternatives considered:\r\n* Adding an ad-hoc `_write_attribute_from_database` method somewhere (`ActiveRecord::AttributeMethods::Write`?).\r\n* Deserializing the value using `attributes_builder.types[column].deserialize(value)`.\r\n  \r\n### Checklist\r\n\r\nBefore submitting the PR make sure the following are checked:\r\n\r\n* [x] This Pull Request is related to one change. Unrelated changes should be opened in separate PRs.\r\n* [x] Commit message has a detailed description of what changed and why. If this PR fixes a related issue include it in the commit message. Ex: `[Fix #issue-number]`\r\n* [x] Tests are added or updated if you fix a bug or add a feature.\r\n* [x] CHANGELOG files are updated for the changed libraries if there is a behavior change or additional feature. Minor bug fixes and documentation changes should not be included.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/53436/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/53436/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":14851856167,"node_id":"LE_lADNIULOm6jdz88AAAADdT1XJw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/events/14851856167","actor":{"login":"nvasilevski","id":5512772,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MTI3NzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5512772?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nvasilevski","html_url":"https://github.com/nvasilevski","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nvasilevski/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nvasilevski/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nvasilevski/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nvasilevski/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nvasilevski/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nvasilevski/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nvasilevski/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nvasilevski/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nvasilevski/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2024-10-24T13:41:30Z","label":{"name":"activerecord","color":"0b02e1"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":14851856182,"node_id":"LE_lADNIULOm6jdz88AAAADdT1XNg","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/events/14851856182","actor":{"login":"nvasilevski","id":5512772,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MTI3NzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5512772?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nvasilevski","html_url":"https://github.com/nvasilevski","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nvasilevski/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nvasilevski/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nvasilevski/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nvasilevski/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nvasilevski/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nvasilevski/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nvasilevski/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nvasilevski/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nvasilevski/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2024-10-24T13:41:30Z","label":{"name":"With
