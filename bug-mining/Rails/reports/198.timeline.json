information\r\nAccording to https://github.com/ruby/ruby/pull/12798 ,this is an expected change since Ruby 3.5.0dev uses Unicode 15.1.0.\r\n\r\n> As a result, an orthographic syllable in scripts like Devanagari (e.g. “क्या”, consisting of KA + VIRAMA + YA)\r\n> is now treated as a single extended grapheme cluster rather than split into two.\r\n\r\n### Checklist\r\n\r\nBefore submitting the PR make sure the following are checked:\r\n\r\n* [x] This Pull Request is related to one change. Unrelated changes should be opened in separate PRs.\r\n* [x] Commit message has a detailed description of what changed and why. If this PR fixes a related issue include it in the commit message. Ex: `[Fix #issue-number]`\r\n* [ ] Tests are added or updated if you fix a bug or add a feature.\r\n* [ ] CHANGELOG files are updated for the changed libraries if there is a behavior change or additional feature. Minor bug fixes and documentation changes should not be included.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/54802/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/54802/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":16948666282,"node_id":"CE_lADNIULOrx_JMs8AAAAD8jgfqg","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/events/16948666282","actor":{"login":"yahonda","id":73684,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjczNjg0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/73684?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yahonda","html_url":"https://github.com/yahonda","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yahonda/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yahonda/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yahonda/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yahonda/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yahonda/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yahonda/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yahonda/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yahonda/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yahonda/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2025-03-24T05:18:57Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":16948666325,"node_id":"CE_lADNIULOrx_JMs8AAAAD8jgf1Q","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/events/16948666325","actor":{"login":"yahonda","id":73684,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjczNjg0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/73684?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yahonda","html_url":"https://github.com/yahonda","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yahonda/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yahonda/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yahonda/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yahonda/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yahonda/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yahonda/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yahonda/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yahonda/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yahonda/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":"d064be8e62aed6beeae7da37ee59a82863665694","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/commits/d064be8e62aed6beeae7da37ee59a82863665694","created_at":"2025-03-24T05:18:57Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
