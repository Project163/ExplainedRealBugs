When I tested the project in the browser it threw 404 error for the channel js files  When I looked at the application.js file, I saw the line `import \"./channels\"` and changed it to `import \"channels\"` then I tried again. Of course, the same problem was present in `channels/index.js` and `channels/chat_channel.js` files. I changed them to `\"import \"channels/chat_channel\"` and `import \"channels/consumer\"` and the problem was solved.\n\nAs far as I understand, the `using_js_runtime?` method is no longer needed. https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/50ddde5adb9a97d6923370596e69c5beeb9eefca/actioncable/lib/rails/generators/channel/channel_generator.rb#L67","closed_by":{"login":"kamipo","id":12642,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNjQy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12642?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kamipo","html_url":"https://github.com/kamipo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kamipo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kamipo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kamipo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kamipo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kamipo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kamipo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kamipo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kamipo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kamipo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/54241/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/54241/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
