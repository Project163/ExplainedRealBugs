\r\n\r\nI think the real issue is the `log_level` config being set to `:debug` by default which shouldn't apply when a broadcast is configured:\r\nhttps://github.com/rails/rails/blob/89d8569abe2564c8187debf32dd3b4e33d6ad983/railties/lib/rails/application/configuration.rb#L54\r\n\r\nIn Rails 7, if you had configured a broadcast with different logger levels, this would have had to be done inside an initializer after Rails' `initialize_logger` one, otherwise the level on your broadcast would be changed to the default DEBUG value.\r\nhttps://github.com/rails/rails/blob/87f3f811a7320dc8cb79695a1f965189357421b9/railties/lib/rails/application/bootstrap.rb#L57\r\n\r\n\r\nI agree with you that `config.log_level` being ignored seems off, so I think the behaviour that would make the most sense is:\r\n\r\n- Ignore the default `DEBUG` log_level when using a Broadcast Logger\r\n- Set the whole broadcast level when `log_level=` is explicitly called\r\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/1849962058/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"Edouard-chin","id":8122246,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxMjIyNDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8122246?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Edouard-chin","html_url":"https://github.com/Edouard-chin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Edouard-chin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Edouard-chin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Edouard-chin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Edouard-chin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Edouard-chin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Edouard-chin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Edouard-chin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Edouard-chin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Edouard-chin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"actor":{"login":"ghiculescu","id":509837,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwOTgzNw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/509837?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghiculescu","html_url":"https://github.com/ghiculescu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghiculescu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghiculescu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghiculescu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghiculescu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghiculescu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghiculescu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghiculescu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghiculescu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghiculescu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-12-11T21:32:04Z","updated_at":"2023-12-11T21:32:04Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/50329","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/50329/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/50329/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/50329/events","html_url":"https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/50329","id":2036563206,"node_id":"PR_kwDNIULOYbreTA","number":50329,"title":"Revert

I think it's fine for this to be on `main` while we work it out but it shouldn't be on the stable branch, so proposing to revert the backport.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately this change was included in [7.1.2](https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/v7.1.2/railties/lib/rails/application/bootstrap.rb#L59), but not [7.1.1](https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/v7.1.1/railties/lib/rails/application/bootstrap.rb#L57). I'm not sure if being in a release makes it too late to revert (IMO it should still be reverted).","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/50329/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/50329/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/1850922498","html_url":"https://github.com/rails/rails/issues/50324#issuecomment-1850922498","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/50324","id":1850922498,"node_id":"IC_kwDNIULOblLWAg","user":{"login":"ghiculescu","id":509837,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwOTgzNw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/509837?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghiculescu","html_url":"https://github.com/ghiculescu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghiculescu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghiculescu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghiculescu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghiculescu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghiculescu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghiculescu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghiculescu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghiculescu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghiculescu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-12-11T21:32:39Z","updated_at":"2023-12-11T21:57:30Z","body":"Thanks for thinking it through with me @Edouard-chin \r\n\r\nI'm not sure about this:\r\n\r\n> Ignore the default `DEBUG` log_level when using a Broadcast Logger\r\n\r\nIf you don't set a `log_level`, then your broadcast loggers need a level, right?

To backport to 7-1 stable please 🙇 \r\n______________________________________\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThanks for contributing to Rails!\r\n\r\nPlease do not make *Draft* pull requests, as they still send\r\nnotifications to everyone watching the Rails repo.\r\n\r\nCreate a pull request when it is ready for review and feedback\r\nfrom the Rails team :).\r\n\r\nIf your pull request affects documentation or any non-code\r\nchanges, guidelines for those changes are [available\r\nhere](https://edgeguides.rubyonrails.org/contributing_to_ruby_on_rails.html#contributing-to-the-rails-documentation)\r\n\r\nAbout this template\r\n\r\nThe following template aims to help contributors write a good description for their pull requests.\r\nWe'd like you to provide a description of the changes in your pull request (i.e. bugs fixed or features added), motivation behind the changes, and complete the checklist below before opening a pull request.\r\n\r\nFeel free to discard it if you need to (e.g. when you just fix a typo). -->\r\n\r\n### Motivation / Background\r\n\r\nIf an application has configured a Broadcast Logger, setting the `config.log_level` to any value has no effect:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\n# config/application.rb\r\n\r\nconfig.logger = ActiveSupport::BroadcastLogger.new(Logger.new(STDOUT))\r\nconfig.log_level = :warn\r\n\r\nputs Rails.logger.broadcasts.map(&:level) #=> [Logger::DEBUG]\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is a side effect of #49621 which tried to fix the `log_level` default value overriding the whole broadcasts.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Detail\r\n\r\n##### Context\r\n\r\nThe `log_level` default's value shouldn't apply to a Broadcast Logger, as otherwise it overrides whatever the application previously configured. While this behaviour is the same with a vanilla logger, at least we can workaround it:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\n###############################\r\n# When using a vanilla logger #\r\n###############################\r\n\r\nconfig.logger = Logger.new(STDOUT, level: LOGGER::WARN)\r\n# Once the app boots, the level is overriden to DEBUG. We need to add the following line.\r\nconfig.log_level = :warn\r\n\r\n#################################\r\n# When using a broadcast logger #\r\n#################################\r\n\r\nstdout = Logger.new(STDOUT, level: Logger::INFO)\r\nstderr = Logger.new(STDERR, level: Logger::ERROR)\r\nconfig.logger = ActiveSupport::BroadcastLogger(stdout, stderr)\r\n\r\n# Once the app boots the whole broadcast level is overriden to DEBUG.\r\n# There is no way to workaround this as you can't fine grain the level of each\r\n# loggers with `config.log_level=`.\r\n```\r\n\r\n##### Solution\r\n\r\nThis PR ignores the default `log_level` value when using a Broadcast Logger, but ensure it gets used if an application manually sets it.\r\n\r\nFix #50324\r\ncc/ @ghiculescu \r\n\r\n### Checklist\r\n\r\nBefore submitting the PR make sure the following are checked:\r\n\r\n* [x] This Pull Request is related to one change. Changes that are unrelated should be opened in separate PRs.\r\n* [x] Commit message has a detailed description of what changed and why. If this PR fixes a related issue include it in the commit message. Ex: `[Fix #issue-number]`\r\n* [x] Tests are added or updated if you fix a bug or add a feature.\r\n* [ ] CHANGELOG files are updated for the changed libraries if there is a behavior change or additional feature. Minor bug fixes and documentation changes should not be included.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/50337/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":1,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/50337/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/1852811604","html_url":"https://github.com/rails/rails/issues/50324#issuecomment-1852811604","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/50324","id":1852811604,"node_id":"IC_kwDNIULObm-pVA","user":{"login":"ghiculescu","id":509837,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwOTgzNw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/509837?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghiculescu","html_url":"https://github.com/ghiculescu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghiculescu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghiculescu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghiculescu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghiculescu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghiculescu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghiculescu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghiculescu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghiculescu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghiculescu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-12-12T21:06:20Z","updated_at":"2023-12-12T21:06:20Z","body":"Thanks for your help, makes total sense to me.
