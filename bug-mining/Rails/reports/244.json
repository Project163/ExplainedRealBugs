Select another workspace to continue\".\n\nThe \"select\" option does not show the `folder` with your rails app.\n\nI think this was adjusted in #54631, and may break devcontainer for users who have an app name different from the folder name they're developing in.\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nThe devcontainer starts successfully and shows my files.\n\n### Actual behavior\n\nThe devcontainer returns an error that a workspace cannot be found.  It prompts me to select a folder, showing my app name as an option - however that folder is empty when picked.\n\n### System configuration\n\n**Rails version**:  8.1.0\n\n**Ruby version**:  3.3.9\n","closed_by":{"login":"rafaelfranca","id":47848,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3ODQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47848?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelfranca","html_url":"https://github.com/rafaelfranca","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelfranca/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelfranca/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelfranca/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelfranca/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelfranca/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelfranca/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelfranca/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelfranca/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelfranca/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/56024/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/56024/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
