Motivation / Background\r\n\r\nCurrently `assert_enqueued_with` allows you to pass procs for matching `args`.\r\n\r\nHowever, `assert_enqueued_email_with` doesn't let you do that for `args` and `params`.\r\n\r\nI propose that we should.\r\n\r\nFor example, if you are passing a generated token to an email, you would have to mock/stub your way to verify that it looks right in job args. Or you have to reach for the lower level `assert_enqueued_with` helper. With this change you could simply do something like this:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nassert_enqueued_email_with UserMailer, :verification, params: -> p { p[:token] =~ /\\w+/ }\r\n```\r\n\r\nFixes #46621.\r\n\r\n### Detail\r\n\r\nSince `assert_enqueued_email_with` tries to be clever about figuring out whether `args` are `params`, I decided to leave that logic completely intact (to preserve current behavior), and add another conditional branch which only kicks in if either args or params are a proc. In such a case, it never acts clever about args/params, and simply passes down a lambda that fails if any job args don't match, and succeeds if they do.\r\n\r\n**One unrelated question**: why are we [currently overwriting](https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/main/actionmailer/lib/action_mailer/test_helper.rb#L153) the passed-in params? Is that a bug?\r\n\r\n### Checklist\r\n\r\nBefore submitting the PR make sure the following are checked:\r\n\r\n* [x] This Pull Request is related to one change. Changes that are unrelated should be opened in separate PRs.\r\n* [x] Commit message has a detailed description of what changed and why. If this PR fixes a related issue include it in the commit message.
