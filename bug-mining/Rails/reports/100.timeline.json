adds a new Active Record encryption option to support previous data encrypted non-deterministically with a SHA1 hash digest.\r\n\r\nThere is currently a problem with Active Record encryption for users updating from 7.0 to 7.1 Before #44873, data encrypted with non-deterministic encryption was always using SHA-1. The reason is that `ActiveSupport::KeyGenerator.hash_digest_class` was set in an `after_initialize` block in the railtie config, but encryption config was running before that, so it was effectively using the previous default SHA1. That means that existing users are using SHA256 for non deterministic encryption, and SHA1 for deterministic encryption.\r\n\r\nThis adds a new option `support_sha1_for_non_deterministic_encryption` that users can enable to support for SHA1 and SHA256 when decrypting existing data.\r\n\r\nThe new option will kick-in by default for versions prior to 7.1. The idea is that:\r\n\r\n- Existing users updating from 7.0, won't have to set it, as it will get enabled by default.\r\n- Users starting with 7.1 will have the option disabled.\r\n\r\nThis also improves the initialization system for AR encryption to make it more robust. It will now happen after all the initializers have run, and the system to declare filtered attributes will work with different load orders.\r\n\r\nBig thanks to @duduribeiro for the thorough investigation and debugging here, as he was the one identifying the issue and who explored alternatives to fix the problem (see #48520). I added him as the co-author of the commit I ported from that PR.\r\n\r\nPending: \r\n\r\n- [x] Validate patch in real scenarios\r\n- [x] Update new framework default initializer\r\n- [x] Update

note:\r\n\r\nIf you need a workaround, until the fix for this issue lands on your Rails version, you can force `ActiveRecord::Encryption` to use your configurations right after you defined them, e.g. in your application/env config or initializer:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\n# Define configs\r\nconfig.active_record.encryption.* = ...\r\nconfig.active_record.encryption.* = ...\r\n\r\n# Use configs now! (to be removed if using Rails 7.1.4+)\r\nActiveRecord::Encryption.configure(**config.active_record.encryption)\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt will ensure your configs are loaded soon enough, even in eager loading

Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\n#### Setting up the App\r\n\r\n```sh\r\nrails _7.0.8_ new test_rails_enc\r\ncd test_rails_enc\r\nbin/rails db:encryption:init\r\nrails credentials:edit # Copying the keys\r\nrails g model user email:string name:string\r\n```\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nclass User < ApplicationRecord\r\n  encrypts :email, deterministic: true\r\n  encrypts :name\r\nend\r\n```\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nUser.create(name: \"Zaratan\", email: \"zaratan@hey.com\")\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Migrating to Rails 7.1\r\nIn the Gemfile\r\n```ruby\r\ngem \"rails\", \"~> 7.1.2\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n```sh\r\nrails app:update # Answering Yes to every question\r\nrails db:migrate\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\nEmail:\r\n```ruby\r\nUser.pluck(:email).first\r\n```\r\n```\r\n  User Pluck (0.3ms)  SELECT \"users\".\"email\" FROM \"users\"\r\n/Users/zaratan/.rvm/gems/ruby-3.2.2/gems/activerecord-7.1.2/lib/active_record/encryption/encryptor.rb:58:in `rescue in decrypt':

Adding : \r\n```\r\nconfig.active_record.encryption.support_sha1_for_non_deterministic_encryption = true\r\n```\r\n\r\n=> Same behaviour\r\n\r\n#### If Changing to Rails 7.1 defaults\r\n```\r\n    config.load_defaults 7.1\r\n```\r\n\r\nReading the name will trigger a cipher error and the email will be read correctly\r\n\r\n#### If setting config.active_record.encryption.hash_digest_class to `OpenSSL::Digest::SHA1`\r\n\r\n```\r\nconfig.active_record.encryption.hash_digest_class = OpenSSL::Digest::SHA1\r\n```\r\n\r\n=> Email: Cipher Error, Name: Ok\r\n\r\n#### If setting config.active_record.encryption.hash_digest_class to `OpenSSL::Digest::SHA256`\r\n\r\n=> Email: Ok, Name: Cipher Error\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\nIf a user didn't configure anything the upgrade path should exist or be documented in a way. I think I tried every configuration option documented and couldn't make it work.\r\n\r\nProduction is still on 7.0.8 so I didn't get any terrible damage but what would be an upgrade path for me (and for others)\r\n\r\n### Actual behavior\r\n`OpenSSL::Cipher::CipherError`\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n**Rails version**: 7.0.8 => 7.1.2\r\n\r\n**Ruby version**: 3.2.2\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/50212/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/50212/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"actor":{"login":"trevorturk","id":402,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/402?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/trevorturk","html_url":"https://github.com/trevorturk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trevorturk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trevorturk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trevorturk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trevorturk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trevorturk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trevorturk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trevorturk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trevorturk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trevorturk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-01-24T17:42:57Z","updated_at":"2024-01-24T17:42:57Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/48204","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/48204/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/48204/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/48204/events","html_url":"https://github.com/rails/rails/issues/48204","id":1707228995,"node_id":"I_kwDNIULOZcI_Qw","number":48204,"title":"Upgrade
