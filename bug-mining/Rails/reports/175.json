It's possibly related to the fact that Active Support's `Hash` extension implement `#deep_merge!` in the [ActiveSupport::DeepMergeable](https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/6695ac7f71a148e262810396830ce5230082a450/activesupport/lib/active_support/deep_mergeable.rb#L33-L44) module. However, `ActiveSupport::DeepMergeable` also implements `#deep_merge`, but is generating API documentation properly through the [`:method: deep_merge` directive](https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/6695ac7f71a148e262810396830ce5230082a450/activesupport/lib/active_support/core_ext/hash/deep_merge.rb#L8-L11).\r\n\r\nA similar [`:method: deep_merge!` directive](https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/6695ac7f71a148e262810396830ce5230082a450/activesupport/lib/active_support/core_ext/hash/deep_merge.rb#L30-L32) exists, but isn't generating documentation.\r\n\r\n### Actual behavior\r\n\r\nVisiting https://edgeapi.rubyonrails.org/classes/Hash.html#method-i-deep_merge-21 does not navigate directly to `Hash#deep_merge!` documentation.\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n**Rails version**: Edge (as of [6695ac7f](https://github.com/rails/rails/commit/6695ac7f71a148e262810396830ce5230082a450))\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"rafaelfranca","id":47848,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3ODQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47848?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelfranca","html_url":"https://github.com/rafaelfranca","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelfranca/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelfranca/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelfranca/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelfranca/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelfranca/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelfranca/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelfranca/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelfranca/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelfranca/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/53754/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/53754/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
