encounter an issue in our Ruby environments that handle very low volumes of traffic. The first query after the worker has been idle for a long time raises 'Trilogy::SSLError: trilogy_query_recv: SSL Error: unexpected eof while reading'. After reconnecting subsequent queries work without issue.\n\nWe currently have some custom code to catch these exceptions, reconnect and try the work again. But similar code is already present in rails. \n\nI believe this logic in rails is not used at the moment because the exception is not recognized as indicating a 'retryable connection error'.\nIn the Trilogy Ruby bindings there is some logic to translate Trilogy exceptions to standard active record exceptions. These translated values are then checked in the rails code to see whether a database statement can be retried if it raised the exception.\n\nLooking at the code in ActiveRecord::ConnectionAdapters::TrilogyAdapter.translate_exception() I believe this error should also be translated to a ActiveRecord::ConnectionFailed exception (similar to a Trilogy::EOFError). \nThis would probably remove the need for our custom rescue/reconnect logic.\n\nIs this analysis correct, would it make sense to also translate SSLErrors that way or am I misunderstanding the meaning/logic here?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/trilogy-libraries/trilogy/issues/230/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/trilogy-libraries/trilogy/issues/230/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/2929968683","html_url":"https://github.com/rails/rails/issues/55126#issuecomment-2929968683","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/55126","id":2929968683,"node_id":"IC_kwDNIULOrqPGKw","user":{"login":"byroot","id":44640,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0NjQw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/44640?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/byroot","html_url":"https://github.com/byroot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/byroot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/byroot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/byroot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/byroot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/byroot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/byroot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/byroot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/byroot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/byroot/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-06-02T10:40:08Z","updated_at":"2025-06-02T10:40:08Z","body":"> Is this analysis correct\n\nYes.","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/2929968683/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"byroot","id":44640,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0NjQw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/44640?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/byroot","html_url":"https://github.com/byroot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/byroot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/byroot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/byroot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/byroot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/byroot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/byroot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/byroot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/byroot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/byroot/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/2975187730","html_url":"https://github.com/rails/rails/issues/55126#issuecomment-2975187730","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/55126","id":2975187730,"node_id":"IC_kwDNIULOsVXDEg","user":{"login":"heka1024","id":44280450,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0MjgwNDUw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/44280450?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/heka1024","html_url":"https://github.com/heka1024","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/heka1024/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/heka1024/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/heka1024/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/heka1024/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/heka1024/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/heka1024/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/heka1024/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/heka1024/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/heka1024/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-06-16T05:50:05Z","updated_at":"2025-06-16T05:50:05Z","body":"@fhoeben I’m experiencing the same issue.

\n\nFirst of all, thank you very much for this project — we’ve been running SolidQueue in production for nearly two months now, and it's looking pretty good so far.\n\nHowever, when we (or rather Kubernetes) send a SIGTERM to one of the SolidQueue processes, the shutdown is a bit… rocky.  \nWe consistently see the following error during shutdown:\n\n> ActiveRecord::StatementInvalid Trilogy::SSLError: trilogy_query_recv: SSL Error: unexpected EOF while reading\n\nIt seems like this doesn’t impact actual functionality — jobs are released and shutdown completes — but the error message looks a bit alarming in our logs.\n\nIs there a recommended way to suppress or avoid this message? \n\nThanks again for the great work!\n\n---\n| @timestamp | log | log.message |\n| --- | ---
