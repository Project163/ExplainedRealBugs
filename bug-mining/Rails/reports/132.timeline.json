and should reduce issues with future Rails updates\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\nBefore you ask people to review this PR:\r\n\r\n- Tests and rubocop should be passing: `bundle exec rake`.\r\n- Github should not be reporting conflicts; you should have recently run `git rebase main`.\r\n- The standards in the [Git Workflow document on Confluence](https://dsdmoj.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/ATPPB/pages/4602855954/Git+Workflow) should be followed.\r\n- There should be no unnecessary whitespace changes. These make diffs harder to read and conflicts more likely.\r\n- The PR description should say what you changed and why, with a link to the JIRA story.\r\n- You should have looked at the diff against main and ensured that nothing unexpected is included in your changes.\r\n- You should have checked that the commit messages say why the change was
