The error I'm observing (`No Failure App provided`) is occurring during `bin/rails test` and originates in the [warden gem](https://github.com/wardencommunity/warden/blob/67f5ba6baaa7564ec79afef02cf3a4d0f7d312e5/lib/warden/manager.rb#L145). This only occurs about 20% of the time, i.e., running `bin/rails test` will complete without errors 4/5 times. The error only occurs when using the `with_routing` helper, e.g., \n\n```ruby\nclass ErrorPagesConcernTest < ActionDispatch::IntegrationTest\n  with_routing do |routes|\n    routes.draw do\n      %w[action_not_found invalid_authenticity_token name_error no_method_error record_not_found routing_error standard_error].each do |action|\n        get \"/default/#{action}\", to: \"error_pages_test##{action}\"\n        get \"/rescued/#{action}\", to: \"rescued_error_pages_test##{action}\"\n      end\n    end\n  end\n  \n  ...\nend\n```\n\nHowever, when I remove the `with_routing` helper and put the testing routes directly in `routes.rb`, the test suite runs without error 100% of the time.\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nThe results of a test suit should be consistent when using the `with_routing` helper.\n\n### Actual behavior\n\nUsing the `with_routing` helper causes inconsistent results in tests.\n\n### System configuration\n\n**Rails version**: 8.0.1\n\n**Ruby version**: 3.2.6","closed_by":{"login":"byroot","id":44640,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0NjQw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/44640?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/byroot","html_url":"https://github.com/byroot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/byroot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/byroot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/byroot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/byroot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/byroot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/byroot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/byroot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/byroot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/byroot/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/54595/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/54595/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
