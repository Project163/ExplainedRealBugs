Motivation / Background\r\n\r\nref: https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/46560#discussion_r1030718963\r\n\r\nAs suggested by @matthewd, this PR makes `compute_class` error message smarter based on how the association is set up. The message will now differ based on if a `class_name` option is provided to the association.\r\n\r\n### Detail\r\n\r\nI changed the error raised from a `NameError` to an `ArgumentError` as that is arguably more relevant here, and it also means we aren't throwing two types of errors in fairly similar circumstances. Incidentally this also makes the testing simpler.\r\n\r\n### Additional information\r\n\r\nThis issue inspired the initial work, though I'm not sure this PR fixes it. https://github.com/rails/rails/issues/46532\r\n\r\nSee also these PRs that originally added and expanded the error message:\r\n\r\n- https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/42124\r\n- https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/40836\r\n\r\n### Checklist\r\n\r\nBefore submitting the PR make sure the following are checked:\r\n\r\n* [x] This Pull Request is related to one change. Changes that are unrelated should be opened in separate PRs.\r\n* [x] Commit message has a detailed description of what changed and why. If this PR fixes a related issue include it in the commit message. Ex: `[Fix #issue-number]`\r\n* [x] Tests are added or updated if you fix a bug or add a feature.\r\n* [x] CHANGELOG files are updated for the changed libraries if there is a behavior change or additional feature. Minor bug fixes and documentation changes should not be included.\r\n* [x] CI is passing.\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/46605/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/46605/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":7916095976,"node_id":"CE_lADNIULOVtd9bc8AAAAB19YJ6A","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/events/7916095976","actor":{"login":"rafaelfranca","id":47848,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3ODQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47848?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelfranca","html_url":"https://github.com/rafaelfranca","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelfranca/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelfranca/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelfranca/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelfranca/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelfranca/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelfranca/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelfranca/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelfranca/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelfranca/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-11-29T20:16:58Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":7944292682,"node_id":"REFE_lADNIULOVtd9bc8AAAAB2YRJSg","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/events/7944292682","actor":{"login":"jonathanhefner","id":771968,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc3MTk2OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/771968?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonathanhefner","html_url":"https://github.com/jonathanhefner","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonathanhefner/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonathanhefner/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonathanhefner/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonathanhefner/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonathanhefner/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonathanhefner/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonathanhefner/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonathanhefner/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonathanhefner/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"8d46b2d5dfcb9367d1c7a391f39ff419aa6f2659","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jonathanhefner/rails/commits/8d46b2d5dfcb9367d1c7a391f39ff419aa6f2659","created_at":"2022-12-02T22:23:17Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"actor":{"login":"jonathanhefner","id":771968,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc3MTk2OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/771968?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonathanhefner","html_url":"https://github.com/jonathanhefner","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonathanhefner/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonathanhefner/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonathanhefner/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonathanhefner/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonathanhefner/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonathanhefner/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonathanhefner/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonathanhefner/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonathanhefner/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-12-02T22:25:27Z","updated_at":"2022-12-02T22:25:27Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/46634","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/46634/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/46634/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/46634/events","html_url":"https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/46634","id":1473531530,"node_id":"PR_kwDNIULORC1rQQ","number":46634,"title":"Rescue
