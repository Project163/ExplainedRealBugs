for working on this, Would it be helpful to add the info as NOTE - if implcit_order_column or primary key or query constraint is missing it will raise an error in the guide.\n\nI'll delegate to @byroot but here are my thoughts - By guide if you mean the API docs I think it's tricky cause this actually affects a few other methods as well e.g. `#second_to_last`, `#fourth` etc., and I don't know if it makes sense to mention this in the docs for each. If by guide you meant the actual guides I don't know if this is appropriate to mention there, as it's somewhat of an implementation detail, but there seem to be some cases where errors are mentioned.\n\nI'll also note that I've included this information in the error message in my PR, so it should be clear to users why we're raising.","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/2678595399/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"joshuay03","id":54629302,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0NjI5MzAy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/54629302?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshuay03","html_url":"https://github.com/joshuay03","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshuay03/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshuay03/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshuay03/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshuay03/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshuay03/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshuay03/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshuay03/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshuay03/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshuay03/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":16431999033,"node_id":"MEE_lADNIULOqxYriM8AAAAD02xoOQ","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/events/16431999033","actor":{"login":"byroot","id":44640,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0NjQw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/44640?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/byroot","html_url":"https://github.com/byroot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/byroot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/byroot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/byroot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/byroot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/byroot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/byroot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/byroot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/byroot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/byroot/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2025-02-24T14:27:51Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":16431999053,"node_id":"SE_lADNIULOqxYriM8AAAAD02xoTQ","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/events/16431999053","actor":{"login":"byroot","id":44640,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0NjQw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/44640?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/byroot","html_url":"https://github.com/byroot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/byroot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/byroot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/byroot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/byroot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/byroot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/byroot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/byroot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/byroot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/byroot/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2025-02-24T14:27:51Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":16432061574,"node_id":"REFE_lADNIULOqxYriM8AAAAD021chg","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/events/16432061574","actor":{"login":"joshuay03","id":54629302,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0NjI5MzAy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/54629302?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshuay03","html_url":"https://github.com/joshuay03","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshuay03/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshuay03/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshuay03/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshuay03/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshuay03/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshuay03/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshuay03/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshuay03/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshuay03/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"693debda3b6279cc07512181d9ebfbc98dd2a600","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/joshuay03/rails/commits/693debda3b6279cc07512181d9ebfbc98dd2a600","created_at":"2025-02-24T14:31:04Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":16432087344,"node_id":"REFE_lADNIULOqxYriM8AAAAD023BMA","url":"http
