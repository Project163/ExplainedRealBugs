Motivation / Background\r\n\r\nRef #55161\r\n\r\nIn Rails 7, a new render tracking implementation was [added][1] to Rails: the RipperTracker. From that commit message:\r\n\r\n> Using a parser finds dependencies that would otherwise be difficult to\r\n> find with the regular expressions. It should also theoretically work\r\n> with other template systems since it operates on the compiled template\r\n> instead of the contents of the file.\r\n\r\nIt was initially made the default render tracker, but that change was later [backed out][2].\r\n\r\nSince then, the Prism parser was released and made the default Ruby parser. A Prism render tracker implementation was also [added][3] to Rails in 7.2.\r\n\r\n### Detail\r\n\r\nUntil now, there hasn't been a \"blessed\" way for applications to try out the new tracker implementations (you would have to go through private API). This commit adds configuration to not only make it easy for applications to use the new Ruby-parser-based trackers, but it also makes these new trackers the default for new applications on 8.1.\r\n\r\nThe new trackers are not only better at finding `render` calls, they are also much easier to maintain. When I [added][4] trailing interpolation tracking to the three trackers, the Prism tracker was by far the easiest to work with.\r\n\r\n[1]: https://github.com/rails/rails/commit/897b9bf6e29a9aa7c04d3e4cb96a65665565154d\r\n[2]: https://github.com/rails/rails/commit/41c0681fb7626d036005f8dec559a507ff143874\r\n[3]: https://github.com/rails/rails/commit/d743a2b10fb50dc4702ba4e73955c4f94b3bf700\r\n[4]: https://github.com/rails/rails/commit/13df150c06e37a7024baa655000ae2d7eff9fc0c\r\n\r\n### Checklist\r\n\r\nBefore submitting the PR make sure the following are checked:\r\n\r\n* [x] This Pull Request is related to one change.
