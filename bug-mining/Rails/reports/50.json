Create Rails 7.0.4.3 app in `api_only` mode\r\n2. Configure database for multi-shards as described [here](https://edgeguides.rubyonrails.org/active_record_multiple_databases.html)\r\n3. Add sample `shard_resolver` to `application.rb` file.\r\n3. Implement sample endpoint that calls any db query and observe to last line of logs processing.\r\n4. Put the code below to the initializer.\r\n\r\n```\r\nActiveSupport::Notifications.subscribe \"process_action.action_controller\" do |event|\r\n  Rails.logger.info \"Duration: #{event.duration}; DB: #{event.payload[:db_runtime].to_i}\"\r\n  # Notice that event.payload[:db_runtime] is always nil here\r\nend\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Expected behaviour\r\nThe log line that summarises the request completion should contain `ActiveRecord` time. Also, the instrumentation hook for `process_action.action_controller` event should have `event.payload[:db_runtime]` not being nil. Please see SS below:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"540\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/rails/rails/assets/15077823/29574765-0dfd-4d14-b044-d4fb1528ffc4\">\r\n\r\n\r\n### Actual behavior\r\nRails doesn't seem to correctly keep track of database time throughout the request lifecycle for multi-db setup resulting in missing ActiveRecord time in logs. Please see SS below:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"388\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/rails/rails/assets/15077823/722cf567-3e1e-4651-884f-96853c2aa35a\">\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n**Rails version**: 7.0.4.3\r\n\r\n**Ruby version**: 3.0.2\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"eileencodes","id":1080678,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwODA2Nzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1080678?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/eileencodes","html_url":"https://github.com/eileencodes","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eileencodes/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eileencodes/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eileencodes/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eileencodes/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eileencodes/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eileencodes/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eileencodes/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eileencodes/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eileencodes/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/48687/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/48687/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
