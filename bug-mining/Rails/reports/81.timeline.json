am sorry if it's not the right place for this issue but so far I've failed to understand the exact reason of the fail so it's hard for me to understand where to report it (here? other rspec repo? rails repo? or maybe problem in my code?).\r\n\r\n### Subject of the issue\r\n\r\nI am attempting an upgrade of our Rails 6.1 application that includes rspec 3.11 to Rails 7.0. During this upgrade I stumbled upon a spec in our code that is not working after the upgrade and I can't understand why. It seems like a combination of factors all put together prevent the mocked record to correctly understand it has been called.\r\nWhy I believe it has been called is because I can see in the output the message `inside dummy`. (Well, actually I see it two times but the first one is printed before the transaction and setting of the expectation in the spec.)\r\n\r\nBelow is the setup. It's minimized as much as possible.\r\nBasically I have three models and when all the conditions (including a 'through' relation in model, 'after_initialize' callback, 'after_save_commit' callback, reload of model in spec, transaction in spec) are met the spec below fails in Rails 7.0 but passes in Rails 6.1. If even one of the conditions is not met (removed) then the spec passes.\r\n\r\nscript.rb\r\n```ruby\r\nrequire \"bundler/inline\"\r\n\r\ngemfile(true) do\r\n  source \"https://rubygems.org\"\r\n  ruby \"3.0.2\"\r\n  gem \"activerecord\", \"7.0.4\"\r\n  gem \"sqlite3\", \"1.5.3\"\r\n  gem \"rspec\", \"3.11.0\"\r\nend\r\n\r\nputs \"Ruby version is: #{RUBY_VERSION}\"\r\n\r\nrequire \"rspec/autorun\"\r\nrequire \"active_record\"\r\n\r\nclass CreateTables < ActiveRecord::Migration[6.1]\r\n  def change\r\n    drop_table :articles if table_exists? :articles\r\n    drop_table :reviews if table_exists? :reviews\r\n    drop_table :article_reviews if table_exists? :article_reviews\r\n    create_table :articles\r\n    create_table :reviews do |t|\r\n      t.integer \"desired_article_id\"\r\n    end\r\n    create_table :article_reviews do |t|\r\n      t.integer  \"review_id\"\r\n      t.integer  \"article_id\"\r\n    end\r\n  end\r\nend\r\n\r\nActiveRecord::Base.establish_connection(adapter: \"sqlite3\", database: \"test.sqlite3\")\r\nCreateTables.new.change\r\n\r\nclass Review < ActiveRecord::Base\r\n  belongs_to :desired_article, class_name: \"Article\", inverse_of: :review, optional: true\r\n  has_one :article_review, inverse_of: :review\r\n  has_one :article, through: :article_review\r\n\r\n  after_initialize do\r\n    self.desired_article = build_desired_article\r\n  end\r\n\r\n  after_save_commit :dummy\r\n  def dummy\r\n    puts 'inside dummy'\r\n  end\r\nend\r\n\r\nclass Article < ActiveRecord::Base\r\n  has_one :review, foreign_key: \"desired_article_id\", inverse_of: :desired_article\r\n  has_one :article_review\r\nend\r\n\r\nclass ArticleReview < ActiveRecord::Base\r\n  belongs_to :article, required: true\r\n  belongs_to :review, required: true\r\nend\r\n\r\nRSpec.describe Review do\r\n  it do\r\n    record = Review.create!\r\n    record.reload\r\n    expect(record).to receive(:dummy)\r\n    record.transaction do\r\n      record.article = record.build_desired_article\r\n      record.save!\r\n    end\r\n  end\r\nend\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Your environment\r\n* Ruby version: 3.0.2\r\n* rspec-mocks version: 3.11.1 or 3.11.0\r\n* Active Record version (working): 6.1.7\r\n* Active Record version (not working): 7.0.4\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\nPut the code from the script above to some file (e.g. script.rb) and run \r\n```\r\nruby script.rb\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo run it with Rails 6 just change `gem \"activerecord\", \"7.0.4\"` to `gem \"activerecord\", \"6.1.7\"`.\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\nSpec passes.

This usually points to `self` but since that change in the commit above it actually now points to `fresh_object`, not `self`. In most of the cases it's fine (`self` and `fresh_object` are the same record after all) but in some rare cases like the one I posted in this issue it starts to become a difference. Maybe it's some internal implementation of after_save_commit callback, I haven't dug so deep yet. But I can see that under the circumstances described in this issue when the code from after_save_commit callback is called second time there is a confusion between the record it updates and the record from the main thread. One of them is updated, another one is not.\r\n\r\nI think we just need to have the same instance of the record in the owners of associations from `@association_cache` and it would solve the problem. I am gonna try making a PR.

Motivation / Background\r\n\r\nFixes #46363 which was caused by https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/41112\r\n\r\nCurrently calling `reload` re-calculates the association cache based on the object freshly loaded from the database. The fresh object gets assigned as `owner` for each association in the association cache. That object however is not the same as `self` (even though they both point to the same record). Under some specific circumstances (using `has_one/has_many through` associations and transactions with `after_commit` callbacks) this might lead to losing the effects of assignments done inside the callback.\r\n\r\nThis commit fixes it by making `reload` point to `self` as `owner` for each association in the association cache.\r\n\r\nI think this is safe because as far as I can see in https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/main/activerecord/lib/active_record/associations.rb#L320 it always passes `self` when creating a new association.\r\n\r\n### Detail\r\n\r\nThis Pull Request changes `ActiveRecord::Persistence#reload` method.\r\n\r\n### Checklist\r\n\r\nBefore submitting the PR make sure the following are checked:\r\n\r\n* [x] This Pull Request is related to one change. Changes that are unrelated should be opened in separate PRs.\r\n* [x] Commit message has a detailed description of what changed and why. If this PR fixes a related issue include it in the commit message. Ex: `[Fix #issue-number]`\r\n* [x] Tests are added or updated if you fix a bug or add a feature.\r\n* [ ] CHANGELOG files are updated for the changed libraries if there is a behavior change or additional feature. Minor bug fixes and documentation changes should not be included.\r\n* [x] CI is passing.\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/46383/reactions","total_count":3,"+1":3,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/46383/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":7918521462,"node_id":"LE_lADNIULOVQGQLs8AAAAB1_sMdg","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/events/7918521462","actor":{"login":"yahonda","id":73684,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjczNjg0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/73684?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yahonda","html_url":"https://github.com/yahonda","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yahonda/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yahonda/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yahonda/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yahonda/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yahonda/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yahonda/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yahonda/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yahonda/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yahonda/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-11-30T04:50:31Z","label":{"name":"activerecord","color":"0b02e1"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/1447597531","html_url":"https://github.com/rails/rails/issues/46363#issuecomment-1447597531","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/46363","id":1447597531,"node_id":"IC_kwDNIULOVkiV2w","user":{"login":"rails-bot[bot]","id":28418009,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90Mjg0MTgwMDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/2272?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rails-bot%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/rails-bot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rails-bot%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rails-bot%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rails-bot%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rails-bot%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rails-bot%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rails-bot%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rails-bot%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rails-bot%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rails-bot%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-02-28T05:21:10Z","updated_at":"2023-02-28T05:21:10Z","body":"This
