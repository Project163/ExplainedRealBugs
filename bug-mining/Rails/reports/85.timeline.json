for contributing to Rails!\r\n\r\nPlease do not make *Draft* pull requests, as they still send\r\nnotifications to everyone watching the Rails repo.\r\n\r\nCreate a pull request when it is ready for review and feedback\r\nfrom the Rails team :).\r\n\r\nIf your pull request affects documentation or any non-code\r\nchanges, guidelines for those changes are [available\r\nhere](https://edgeguides.rubyonrails.org/contributing_to_ruby_on_rails.html#contributing-to-the-rails-documentation)\r\n\r\nAbout this template\r\n\r\nThe following template aims to help contributors write a good description for their pull requests.\r\nWe'd like you to provide a description of the changes in your pull request (i.e. bugs fixed or features added), motivation behind the changes, and complete the checklist below before opening a pull request.\r\n\r\nFeel free to discard it if you need to (e.g. when you just fix a typo). -->\r\n\r\n### Motivation / Background\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nDescribe why this Pull Request needs to be merged. What bug have you fixed? What feature have you added? Why is it important?\r\nIf you are fixing a specific issue, include \"Fixes #ISSUE\" (replace with the issue number, remove the quotes) and the issue will be linked to this PR.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nFixes https://github.com/rails/rails/issues/50230\r\n\r\n### Detail\r\n\r\nThis Pull Request changes `ActiveJob::Serializers::TimeWithZoneSerializer` to include the time zone of the provided time with zone object in the serialized hash which is then used during deserialization.\r\n\r\n### Additional information\r\n\r\n<!-- Provide additional information such as benchmarks, reference to other repositories or alternative solutions. -->\r\n\r\nA side effect of this change is that `ActiveJob::Serializers::TimeWithZoneSerializer` now inherits directly from `ActiveJob::Serializers::ObjectSerializer` instead of `ActiveJob::Serializers::TimeObjectSerializer` in order to define it's own `#serialize`. I don't see another way to implement this while preserving the current inheritance.\r\n\r\n### Checklist\r\n\r\nBefore submitting the PR make sure the following are checked:\r\n\r\n* [x] This Pull Request is related to one change. Changes that are unrelated should be opened in separate PRs.\r\n* [x] Commit message has a detailed description of what changed and why. If this PR fixes a related issue include it in the commit message. Ex: `[Fix #issue-number]`\r\n* [x] Tests are added or updated if you fix a bug or add a feature.\r\n* [x] CHANGELOG files are updated for the changed libraries if there is a behavior change or additional feature. Minor bug fixes and documentation changes should not be included.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/50240/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/50240/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":11128190161,"node_id":"REFE_lADNIULOeHiJZc8AAAACl0q00Q","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/events/11128190161","actor":{"login":"joshuay03","id":54629302,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0NjI5MzAy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/54629302?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshuay03","html_url":"https://github.com/joshuay03","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshuay03/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshuay03/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshuay03/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshuay03/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshuay03/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshuay03/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshuay03/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshuay03/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshuay03/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"384170077a0f2c94a88aacacec81b576b466927a","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/joshuay03/rails/commits/384170077a0f2c94a88aacacec81b576b466927a","created_at":"2023-12-02T06:03:27Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/1837056535","html_url":"https://github.com/rails/rails/issues/50230#issuecomment-1837056535","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/50230","id":1837056535,"node_id":"IC_kwDNIULObX9CFw","user":{"login":"joshuay03","id":54629302,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0NjI5MzAy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/54629302?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshuay03","html_url":"https://github.com/joshuay03","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshuay03/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshuay03/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshuay03/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshuay03/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshuay03/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshuay03/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshuay03/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshuay03/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshuay03/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-12-02T06:13:34Z","updated_at":"2023-12-02T07:18:13Z","body":"I
