Motivation / Background\r\n\r\nThis Pull Request has been created to fix #49323: **Puma fails to boot in production with default config due to missing `Concurrency` constant (Rails 7.1.0.beta1)**\r\n\r\n### Detail\r\n\r\nBefore, using the default `puma/config.rb` generated by `rails new`, Puma would fail to boot in production with this error:\r\n\r\n```\r\n./config/puma.rb:16:in `block in _load_from': uninitialized constant Puma::DSL::Concurrent (NameError)\r\n\tfrom ./config/puma.rb:16:in `fetch'\r\n\tfrom ./config/puma.rb:16:in `_load_from'\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis was because `Concurrent.physical_processor_count` was being referenced before the `Concurrent` constant was initialized.\r\n\r\nFix by requiring `concurrent-ruby` just before the `Concurrent` constant is needed.\r\n\r\nFixes #49323\r\n\r\n### Checklist\r\n\r\nBefore submitting the PR make sure the following are checked:\r\n\r\n* [x] This Pull Request is related to one change. Changes that are unrelated should be opened in separate PRs.\r\n* [x] Commit message has a detailed description of what changed and why. If this PR fixes a related issue include it in the commit message. Ex: `[Fix #issue-number]`\r\n* [x] ~~Tests are added or updated if you fix a bug or add a feature.~~ The [original PR](https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/46838) that introduced `Concurrent.physical_processor_count` did not have any tests\r\n* [x] CHANGELOG files are updated for the changed libraries if there is a behavior change or additional feature. Minor bug fixes and documentation changes should not be included.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/49325/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/49325/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":10423628572,"node_id":"REFE_lADNIULOcXpkD88AAAACbUvzHA","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/events/10423628572","actor":{"login":"mattbrictson","id":189693,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4OTY5Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/189693?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattbrictson","html_url":"https://github.com/mattbrictson","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattbrictson/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattbrictson/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattbrictson/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattbrictson/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattbrictson/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattbrictson/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattbrictson/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattbrictson/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattbrictson/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"39ccb97e3c0d3de6fb54fa34d7ef581801c7b1db","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mattbrictson/rails/commits/39ccb97e3c0d3de6fb54fa34d7ef581801c7b1db","created_at":"2023-09-20T13:54:59Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":10424013537,"node_id":"LE_lADNIULOcXpkD88AAAACbVHS4Q","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/events/10424013537","actor":{"login":"adrianna-chang-shopify","id":22918438,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyOTE4NDM4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22918438?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/adrianna-chang-shopify","html_url":"https://github.com/adrianna-chang-shopify","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adrianna-chang-shopify/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adrianna-chang-shopify/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adrianna-chang-shopify/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adrianna-chang-shopify/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adrianna-chang-shopify/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adrianna-chang-shopify/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adrianna-chang-shopify/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adrianna-chang-shopify/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adrianna-chang-shopify/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2023-09-20T14:25:33Z","label":{"name":"attached
