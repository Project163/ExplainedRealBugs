I'm unsure on whether this is intentional or not, but it has the effect that the files inside this folder (which are bundled with the Rails gem) are treated as Ruby files by editors. This means the code inside them will show up as library code, and can affect editor actions. For example, in RubyMine \"Go to Declaration\" now offers this code as a valid target when trying to navigate to a \"User\" model. I have not tested this with VSCode and language servers, but I suspect it affects them too.\r\n\r\nI am unsure on the history of the `.tt` extension, but I would say it is good practice as it helps prevent any of this code from being accidentally loaded. I think it is worth having this extension even if the authentication generator currently works without it.\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\n\r\nTemplate files should have a unique suffix that ensures they are not accidentally recognised as Ruby code.\r\n\r\n### Actual behavior\r\n\r\nThe current authentication template files are picked up by various editor actions as they are considered Ruby code that is part of the project.\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n**Rails version**: 8.0.0.beta1\r\n\r\n**Ruby version**: 3.3.5\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"guilleiguaran","id":160941,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MDk0MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/160941?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/guilleiguaran","html_url":"https://github.com/guilleiguaran","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guilleiguaran/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guilleiguaran/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guilleiguaran/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guilleiguaran/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guilleiguaran/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guilleiguaran/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guilleiguaran/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guilleiguaran/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guilleiguaran/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/53106/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/53106/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
