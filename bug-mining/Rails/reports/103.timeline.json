Motivation / Background\r\n\r\nrails-html-santizer is a dependency of Action View and a transitive dependency of Action Text (via Action Pack), but may not be loaded until after railties sets configuration defaults, meaning that the sanitizer vendor may remain `Rails::HTML4` and not be set to `Rails::HTML5` as we intend in Rails 7.1.\r\n\r\nThis change `require`s rails-html-sanitizer immediately before it's needed, and avoids the possibly-incorrect assumption that Rails::HTML::Sanitizer is already defined.\r\n\r\nCloses #51246\r\n\r\nIf merged, this should be backported to 7-1-stable.\r\n\r\n### Additional information\r\n\r\nBecause the buggy behavior is dependent on the order in which libraries are loaded, it's difficult to add to the test suite.\r\n\r\nI tested manually using the repro from #51246:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\n#! /usr/bin/env ruby\r\n\r\nrequire \"bundler/inline\"\r\n\r\ngemfile do\r\n  source \"https://rubygems.org\"\r\n  gem \"rails\", path: \"..\"\r\nend\r\n\r\nrequire \"action_controller/railtie\"\r\nrequire \"action_view/railtie\"\r\nrequire \"minitest/autorun\"\r\n\r\nclass TestApp < Rails::Application\r\n  config.load_defaults 7.1\r\n  config.eager_load = true\r\nend\r\n\r\nTestApp.initialize!\r\n\r\nclass BugTest < Minitest::Test\r\n  def test_sanitizer_vendor\r\n    assert_equal ActionView::Helpers::SanitizeHelper.sanitizer_vendor, Rails::HTML5::Sanitizer\r\n  end\r\nend\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Checklist\r\n\r\nBefore submitting the PR make sure the following are checked:\r\n\r\n* [x] This Pull Request is related to one change. Changes that are unrelated should be opened in separate PRs.\r\n* [x] Commit message has a detailed description of what changed and why. If this PR fixes a related issue include it in the commit message.
