They assumed that passing a custom action argument to `:only` when using `#resources` would auto-magically define a route for it with some defaults. Reading the examples in the documentation for these methods, it's not clear (especially to beginners) what all the accepted arguments for these options are, [there are only examples using default actions](https://www.rubydoc.info/docs/rails/ActionDispatch%2FRouting%2FMapper%2FResources:resources).\r\n\r\nI think it would be beneficial if an error was raised if invalid arguments are passed in.\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\n<!-- (Guidelines for creating a bug report are [available\r\nhere](https://edgeguides.rubyonrails.org/contributing_to_ruby_on_rails.html#creating-a-bug-report)) -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Paste your executable test case created from one of the scripts found [here](https://edgeguides.rubyonrails.org/contributing_to_ruby_on_rails.html#create-an-executable-test-case) below: -->\r\n```ruby\r\n# frozen_string_literal: true\r\n\r\nrequire \"bundler/inline\"\r\n\r\ngemfile(true) do\r\n  source \"https://rubygems.org\"\r\n\r\n  git_source(:github) { |repo| \"https://github.com/#{repo}.git\" }\r\n\r\n  gem \"rails\", github: \"rails/rails\", branch: \"main\"\r\nend\r\n\r\nrequire \"action_controller/railtie\"\r\n\r\nclass TestApp < Rails::Application\r\n  config.root = __dir__\r\n  config.hosts << \"example.org\"\r\n  config.secret_key_base = \"secret_key_base\"\r\n\r\n  config.logger = Logger.new($stdout)\r\n  Rails.logger  = config.logger\r\nend\r\n\r\nrequire \"minitest/autorun\"\r\nrequire \"rack/test\"\r\n\r\nclass BugTest < Minitest::Test\r\n  include Rack::Test::Methods\r\n\r\n  def test_invalid_resources_only_option\r\n    assert_raises(ArgumentError) do # ❌ fails quietly, no routes generated\r\n      app.routes.draw do\r\n        resources :posts, only: :foo\r\n      end\r\n\r\n      # => routes: []\r\n      Rails.logger.info(\"routes: #{app.routes.routes.map { |r| r.defaults[:action] }}\")\r\n    end\r\n  end\r\n\r\n  def test_invalid_resources_except_option\r\n    assert_raises(ArgumentError) do # ❌ succeeds quietly, all default routes generated\r\n      app.routes.draw do\r\n        resources :posts, except: :foo\r\n      end\r\n\r\n      # => routes: [\"index\", \"create\", \"new\", \"edit\", \"show\", \"update\", \"update\", \"destroy\"]\r\n      Rails.logger.info(\"routes: #{app.routes.routes.map { |r| r.defaults[:action] }}\")\r\n    end\r\n  end\r\n\r\n  private\r\n    def app\r\n      Rails.application\r\n    end\r\nend\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\n<!-- Tell us what should happen -->\r\n\r\nPassing invalid options to `:only` or `:except` should raise an error with an informative message.\r\n\r\n### Actual behavior\r\n<!-- Tell us what happens instead -->\r\n\r\nPassing invalid options to `:only` fails quietly and no routes are generated.\r\nPassing invalid arguments to `:except` succeeds quietly and all default routes are generated (index, create, new, show, update, and destroy).\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n**Rails version**: Edge\r\n\r\n**Ruby version**: 3.3.0","closed_by":{"login":"byroot","id":44640,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0NjQw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/44640?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/byroot","html_url":"https://github.com/byroot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/byroot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/byroot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/byroot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/byroot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/byroot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/byroot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/byroot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/byroot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/byroot/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/51463/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/51463/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
