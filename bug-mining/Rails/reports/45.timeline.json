Motivation / Background\r\n\r\nFixes #48561\r\n\r\n### Detail\r\n\r\nThis Pull Request fixes an error being raised when providing a class argument to ActiveJob for classes that implement `permitted?`. \r\n\r\nThis code path is primarily intended for instances of `ActionController::Parameters`. However an application could define `permitted?` for it's own purposes resulting in an error. Adding the additional `to_h` narrows the criteria and in the event another type besides `Parameters` is passed will ensure it quacks right.\r\n\r\nCo-authored-by: @sampatbadhe \r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/48566/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/48566/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":9618698373,"node_id":"REFE_lADNIULOaYHap88AAAACPVGwhQ","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/events/9618698373","actor":{"login":"abaldwin88","id":15172605,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MTcyNjA1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15172605?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/abaldwin88","html_url":"https://github.com/abaldwin88","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abaldwin88/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abaldwin88/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abaldwin88/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abaldwin88/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abaldwin88/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abaldwin88/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abaldwin88/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abaldwin88/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abaldwin88/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"719e49485f9f50267000fe52d436da4618a64e04","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/abaldwin88/rails/commits/719e49485f9f50267000fe52d436da4618a64e04","created_at":"2023-06-23T14:52:25Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":9621853330,"node_id":"CE_lADNIULOaYHap88AAAACPYHUkg","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/events/9621853330","actor":{"login":"guilleiguaran","id":160941,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MDk0MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/160941?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/guilleiguaran","html_url":"https://github.com/guilleiguaran","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guilleiguaran/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guilleiguaran/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guilleiguaran/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guilleiguaran/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guilleiguaran/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guilleiguaran/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guilleiguaran/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guilleiguaran/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guilleiguaran/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2023-06-23T19:56:56Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
