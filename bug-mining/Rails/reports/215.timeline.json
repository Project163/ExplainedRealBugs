#51745\r\n\r\n### Motivation / Background\r\n\r\nSuppose you have a PG `tsrange` column named `my_range`. If you create a record with `my_range: (Time.current..)` (inclusive), PG will insert the record with `[my_range,]`, but behind the scenes it'll [convert it](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/rangetypes.html#RANGETYPES-INFINITE) to `[my_range,)`, making it exclusive. \r\n\r\nThe problem is when you `reload` or retrieve the record, it'll be `my_range: (Time.current...)` (exclusive).\r\n\r\nYou can \"force\" inclusivity by using the timestamp value of `infinity` on insertion: `[my_range, infinity]`\r\n\r\nAnd that's what this change does.\r\n\r\n### Checklist\r\n\r\nBefore submitting the PR make sure the following are checked:\r\n\r\n* [x] This Pull Request is related to one change. Unrelated changes should be opened in separate PRs.\r\n* [x] Commit message has a detailed description of what changed and why. If this PR fixes a related issue include it in the commit message. Ex: `[Fix #issue-number]`\r\n* [x] Tests are added or updated if you fix a bug or add a feature.\r\n* [ ] CHANGELOG files are updated for the changed libraries if there is a behavior change or additional feature. Minor bug fixes and documentation changes should not be included.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/51920/reactions","total_count":5,"+1":4,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":1,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/51920/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":13137985846,"node_id":"LE_lADNIULOh-yeJM8AAAADDxXBNg","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/events/13137985846","actor":{"login":"skipkayhil","id":6014046,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYwMTQwNDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6014046?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/skipkayhil","html_url":"https://github.com/skipkayhil","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skipkayhil/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skipkayhil/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skipkayhil/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skipkayhil/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skipkayhil/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skipkayhil/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skipkayhil/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skipkayhil/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skipkayhil/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2024-06-12T22:20:59Z","label":{"name":"activerecord","color":"0b02e1"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":13137985848,"node_id":"LE_lADNIULOh-yeJM8AAAADDxXBOA","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/events/13137985848","actor":{"login":"skipkayhil","id":6014046,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYwMTQwNDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6014046?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/skipkayhil","html_url":"https://github.com/skipkayhil","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skipkayhil/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skipkayhil/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skipkayhil/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skipkayhil/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skipkayhil/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skipkayhil/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skipkayhil/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skipkayhil/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skipkayhil/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2024-06-12T22:20:59Z","label":{"name":"attached

What do you think about this?

I think that could work, and it is almost identical to what I came up with.  I ran into some issues with type casting when there is a mix of time/date and string though, but maybe you solved that be the check in `date_or_time_range?` which I did a little differently. \r\n\r\nI would really appreciate getting this patch through, thank you for looking into to it ! Oh, there is a PR now, I'll go check that out too 😄

similar to this issue https://github.com/rails/rails/issues/51745 but for the lower bound instead of the upper bound.\n\nIn short, time ranges starting with `nil` are stored using `NULL`, but time ranges **ending** with `nil` are stored using `infinity`\n\nIn this case, Active Record **does** seem to consistently serialize and deserialize the range.\n\n```ruby\ntime_range = nil...Time.utc(2000)\n\nBug.create(life: time_range).reload.life == time_range\n# => true\n```\n\nBut `-infinity`/`infinity` and `NULL` are distinct types in PostgreSQL, so at the database level the is indeed an inconsistency.\n\nFor example `upper_inf` and `lower_inf` behave differently on `-infinity`/`infinity` and `NULL`:\n\n```sql\nSELECT period, lower_inf(period)\nFROM (\n  VALUES (tsrange(NULL,'2000-01-01 00:00:00')), (tsrange('-infinity','2000-01-01 00:00:00'))\n) AS t(period)\n```\n\n```\n╔═══════════════════════════════════╤═══════════╗\n║              period               │ lower_inf ║\n╠═══════════════════════════════════╪═══════════╣\n║ (,\"2000-01-01 00:00:00\")          │ t         ║\n║ [-infinity,\"2000-01-01 00:00:00\") │ f         ║\n╚═══════════════════════════════════╧═══════════╝\n```\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\n- Use PG adapter\n- Create `tsrange` column \n- Create a record with `nil...Time.utc(2000)` and another with `Time.utc(2000)...nil`\n- Observe that the former uses `NULL` while the latter uses `infinity`\n\n```ruby\nrequire \"bundler/inline\"\n\ngemfile(true) do\n  source \"https://rubygems.org\"\n\n  git_source(:github) { |repo| \"https://github.com/#{repo}.git\" }\n\n  gem \"rails\", \"~> 8.1.1\"\n  gem \"pg\"\n  gem \"debug\"\nend\n\nrequire \"active_record\"\nrequire \"minitest/autorun\"\nrequire \"logger\"\n\ndb_config = {\n  adapter: \"postgresql\",\n  database: \"infinityrange_test\"\n}\n\nbegin\n  ActiveRecord::Base.establish_connection(db_config.except(:database))\n  ActiveRecord::Base.connection.drop_database(db_config[:database]) rescue nil\n  ActiveRecord::Base.connection.create_database(db_config[:database])\nend\nActiveRecord::Base.establish_connection(db_config)\nActiveRecord::Base.logger = Logger.new(STDOUT)\n\nActiveRecord::Schema.define do\n  create_table :bugs do |t|\n    t.tsrange :life\n  end\nend\n\nclass Bug < ActiveRecord::Base; end\n\nclass LowerBoundInfTest < Minitest::Test\n  def test_lower_bound_inf\n    t = Time.utc(2000)\n\n    Bug.create!(life: t...nil)\n    Bug.create!(life: nil...t)\n\n    expected = <<~TSRANGES.split(\"\\n\")\n      [\"2000-01-01 00:00:00\",infinity)\n      [-infinity,\"2000-01-01 00:00:00\")\n    TSRANGES\n\n    result = ActiveRecord::Base.connection.execute(\"SELECT life FROM bugs ORDER BY id\")\n\n    assert_equal expected, result.pluck(\"life\")\n\n    # Actual:\n    # [\"2000-01-01 00:00:00\",infinity)\n    # (,\"2000-01-01 00:00:00\")\n  end\nend\n```\n\n### Expected behavior\n\n`nil..Time.utc(2000)` is stored as `[-infinity,\"2000-01-01 00:00:00\"]`\n\n### Actual behavior\n\n`nil..Time.utc(2000)` is stored as `(,\"2000-01-01 00:00:00\"]`\n\n### System configuration\n\n**Rails version**: 8.1.1\n\n**Ruby
