Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\nStarting from Rails 7.1, the Action View HTML sanitizer can be customized through the `config.action_view.sanitizer_vendor` setting, with supported values being `Rails::HTML4::Sanitizer` or `Rails::HTML5::Sanitizer`, and the default being `Rails::HTML5::Sanitizer`. The current implementation checks for the `Rails::HTML::Sanitizer` constant defined:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/rails/rails/blob/db30dd6fe71341ac132bb1e850bd4df2596a2803/railties/lib/rails/application/configuration.rb#L313-L321\r\n\r\nHowever, the `Rails::HTML` constant is not defined unless rails-html-sanitizer is explicitly required, which is not the case by default in Rails. This setup does not usually cause issues because sprockets-rails requires rails-html-sanitizer.\r\n\r\npassed test (depends `sprockets-rails` ):\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nrequire \"bundler/inline\"\r\n\r\ngemfile(true, quiet: true) do\r\n  source \"https://rubygems.org\"\r\n\r\n  git_source(:github) { |repo| \"https://github.com/#{repo}.git\" }\r\n\r\n  gem \"rails\", \"~> 7.1\"\r\n  gem \"sprockets-rails\"\r\nend\r\n\r\nrequire \"action_controller/railtie\"\r\nrequire \"action_view/railtie\"\r\nrequire \"minitest/autorun\"\r\n\r\nclass TestApp < Rails::Application\r\n  config.load_defaults 7.1\r\n  config.eager_load = true\r\nend\r\n\r\n# avoid Sprockets::Railtie::ManifestNeededError\r\nFileUtils.mkdir_p \"#{__dir__}/app/assets/config\"\r\nFileUtils.touch \"#{__dir__}/app/assets/config/manifest.js\"\r\n\r\nTestApp.initialize!\r\n\r\nclass BugTest < Minitest::Test\r\n  def test_sanitizer_vendor\r\n    assert_equal ActionView::Helpers::SanitizeHelper.sanitizer_vendor, Rails::HTML5::Sanitizer\r\n  end\r\nend\r\n```\r\n\r\nfailure test:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nrequire \"bundler/inline\"\r\n\r\ngemfile(true, quiet: true) do\r\n  source \"https://rubygems.org\"\r\n\r\n  git_source(:github) { |repo| \"https://github.com/#{repo}.git\" }\r\n\r\n  gem \"rails\", \"~> 7.1\"\r\nend\r\n\r\nrequire \"action_controller/railtie\"\r\nrequire \"action_view/railtie\"\r\nrequire \"minitest/autorun\"\r\n\r\nclass TestApp < Rails::Application\r\n  config.load_defaults 7.1\r\n  config.eager_load = true\r\nend\r\n\r\nTestApp.initialize!\r\n\r\nclass BugTest < Minitest::Test\r\n  def test_sanitizer_vendor\r\n    assert_equal ActionView::Helpers::SanitizeHelper.sanitizer_vendor, Rails::HTML5::Sanitizer\r\n  end\r\nend\r\n```\r\n\r\nResult:\r\n\r\n```\r\n# Running:\r\n\r\nF\r\n\r\nFailure:\r\nBugTest#test_sanitizer_vendor [test1.rb:29]:\r\nExpected: Rails::HTML4::Sanitizer\r\n  Actual: Rails::HTML5::Sanitizer\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\n\r\nRegardless of whether sprockets-rails is being used, the default value of `ActionView::Helpers::SanitizeHelper.sanitizer_vendor` should be `Rails::HTML5::Sanitizer` . Additionally, it should not result in an error in `new_framework_defaults_7_1.rb` .\r\n\r\n### Actual behavior\r\n<!-- Tell us what happens instead -->\r\n\r\n1. Upgrading from Rails 7.0 to 7.1: If `sprockets-rails` is removed and replaced with `propshaft`, the code in `new_framework_defaults_7_1.rb` raises `uninitialized constant Rails::HTML` exception since `rails-html-sanitizer` is not required by default:\r\n\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/rails/rails/blob/v7.1.3.2/railties/lib/rails/generators/rails/app/templates/config/initializers/new_framework_defaults_7_1.rb.tt#L254\r\n\r\n\r\n2. Rails 7.1 without sprockets-rails: Opting for `propshaft` over `sprockets-rails` sets the `sanitizer_vendor` to `Rails::HTML4::Sanitizer`, contrary to the behavior documented in the Rails Upgrade guide.\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\n**Rails version**: 7.1.3\r\n\r\n**Ruby version**: 3.0.3","closed_by":{"login":"eileencodes","id":1080678,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwODA2Nzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1080678?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/eileencodes","html_url":"https://github.com/eileencodes","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eileencodes/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eileencodes/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eileencodes/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eileencodes/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eileencodes/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eileencodes/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eileencodes/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eileencodes/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eileencodes/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/51246/reactions","total_count":3,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":1},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/51246/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
