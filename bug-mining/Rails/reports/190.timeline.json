Or should a user explictly have to call `to_s` before adding the flash?\nRight now this doesn't work (will raise an error) if your cookie serializer is set to messagepack:\n\n```ruby\nclass MyController < ApplicationController\n  def index\n    flash.notice = t(:hello_html) # The `t` thing uses the feature of creating a SafeBuffer when the translatnion key ends with `_html`\n  end\nend\n```\n\nThis also breaks app that uses the popular [responders gem](https://github.com/heartcombo/responders) as there is a feature to automatically add a flash if you have a corresponding action key in your translation
