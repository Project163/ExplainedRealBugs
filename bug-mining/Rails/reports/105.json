For example:\r\n\r\n```rb\r\nclass ResetUsersUpdatedAt < ActiveRecord::Migration[7.1]\r\n  \r\n  def change\r\n    update(<<~SQL.squish)\r\n      UPDATE users\r\n      SET updated_at = NOW()\r\n    SQL\r\n  end\r\n  \r\nend\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen I run this migration upwards, it behaves as expected. `db:migrate` yields the following output:\r\n```\r\n== 20240411074748 ResetUsersUpdatedAt: migrating ==========================\r\n-- execute(\"UPDATE users SET updated_at = NOW()\")\r\n   -> 0.0007s\r\n== 20240411074748 ResetUsersUpdatedAt: migrated (0.0188s) =================\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, the output of `db:rollback` is empty:\r\n```\r\n== 20240411074748 ResetUsersUpdatedAt: reverting ==========================\r\n== 20240411074748 ResetUsersUpdatedAt: reverted (0.0680s) =================\r\n```\r\n\r\nA quick glance at the `updated_at` column reveals that the `update` statement was being silently executed in both direction.\r\nMy expectation would have been that it would raise an `ActiveRecord::IrreversibleMigration` just like `execute` – or otherwise print the executed statement to STDOUT.\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\nRun the code below:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nrequire \"bundler/inline\"\r\n\r\ngemfile(true) do\r\n  source \"https://rubygems.org\"\r\n  gem \"rails\"\r\n  gem \"sqlite3\"\r\nend\r\n\r\nrequire \"active_record\"\r\nrequire \"minitest/autorun\"\r\nrequire \"logger\"\r\n\r\nActiveRecord::Base.establish_connection(adapter: \"sqlite3\", database: \":memory:\")\r\nActiveRecord::Base.logger = Logger.new(STDOUT)\r\n\r\nActiveRecord::Schema.define do\r\n  create_table :payments, force: true do |t|\r\n    t.text :migration_type\r\n  end\r\nend\r\n\r\nclass Payment < ActiveRecord::Base\r\nend\r\n\r\nclass SetMigrationTypeWithUpdate < ActiveRecord::Migration::Current\r\n  def change\r\n    migration_type = reverting? ? 'down' : 'up'\r\n    update(<<~SQL.squish)\r\n      UPDATE payments\r\n      SET migration_type = \"#{migration_type}\"\r\n    SQL\r\n  end\r\nend\r\n\r\nclass SetMigrationTypeWithExecute < ActiveRecord::Migration::Current\r\n  def change\r\n    migration_type = reverting? ?
