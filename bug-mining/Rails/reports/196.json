Create a Rails 8 application with `require \"action_mailer/railtie\"` commented out in `config/application.rb`\n2. Run `bin/rails generate authentication`\n3. Boot the app in production mode or with `config.eager_load = true`. Also can enter `PasswordsMailer` in Rails console and try to evaluate the class.\n\n### Expected behavior\nI believe all of the mailer templates should verify `ActionMailer::Base` is defined before generating mailer related files\n\nhttps://github.com/rails/rails/blob/57c24948eb5cc9e5f9a4cecb6f2060f53e2246e1/railties/lib/rails/generators/rails/authentication/authentication_generator.rb#L24-L29\n\n### Actual behavior\nPasswordsMailer is generated inheriting from ApplicationMailer, which does not exist.\n\n### System configuration\n**Rails version**: Rails 8.0.1\n\n**Ruby version**: ruby 3.3.6 (2024-11-05 revision 75015d4c1f) [x86_64-linux]\n","closed_by":{"login":"byroot","id":44640,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0NjQw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/44640?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/byroot","html_url":"https://github.com/byroot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/byroot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/byroot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/byroot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/byroot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/byroot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/byroot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/byroot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/byroot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/byroot/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/54501/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/54501/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
