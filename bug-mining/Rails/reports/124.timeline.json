#51284\r\n\r\nBoth Proxy controllers in Active Storage set the caching headers early before streaming. \r\n\r\nIn some instances (see #51284), it is possible for the file download (from the storage service to Active Storage) to fail before we send the first byte to the client (response not yet committed). \r\n\r\nIn those instances, this change would invalidate the cache and return a better

Changes that are unrelated should be opened in separate PRs.\r\n* [x] Commit message has a detailed description of what changed and why. If this PR fixes a related issue include it in the commit message.
