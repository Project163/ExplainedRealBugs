At a later date a vulnerability may be discovered that could leverage this issue or the code within this page could be reused elsewhere creating another attack vector that could be triggered by an attacker.\r\nI am not an expert in Ruby or Rails and when I found this issue on a penetration test for a client, we discovered it was not an issue with the web application but one within Rails itself. The screenshot attached is therefore redacted of client identification.\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\nRequest a page that does not have a matching routing to produce the Routing Error page.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\nExpected behaviour is a error page with resources to help navigate the issue.\r\n\r\n### Actual behavior\r\nWithin the search box for Path, it is possible to create a XSS injection.\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n**Rails version**:\r\nNo information on version from client\r\n**Ruby version**:\r\nNo information on version from client.\r\n\r\n![Screenshot 2022-09-23 at 14 49 09](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/98428/195814171-2eebc521-f55d-464b-8095-1d6e89a6a514.png)\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"byroot","id":44640,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0NjQw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/44640?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/byroot","html_url":"https://github.com/byroot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/byroot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/byroot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/byroot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/byroot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/byroot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/byroot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/byroot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/byroot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/byroot/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/46244/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/46244/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
