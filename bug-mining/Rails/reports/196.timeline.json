Motivation / Background\r\n\r\nThis Pull Request has been created because if the authentication generator is run in an app created with `--skip-action-mailer`, the app will be silently broken. When deployed to an environment where `eager_load` is true, the app will fail to start as the generated `PasswordMailer` inherits from a nonexistent `ApplicationMailer`.\r\n\r\nFixes #54501 \r\n\r\n### Detail\r\n\r\nThis Pull Request changes the authentication generator to skip all of the mailer-related files if `ActionMailer` is not defined. Also leave `PasswordsController#create` as blank to be implemented by the user.\r\n\r\n### Additional information\r\n\r\nIn my use case, a simple login was enough, and I created user(s) manually in a console. I do not need a password reset flow. An alternative approach would be to require an app to have `ActionMailer` to run the generator.\r\n\r\n### Checklist\r\n\r\nBefore submitting the PR make sure the following are checked:\r\n\r\n* [x] This Pull Request is related to one change. Unrelated changes should be opened in separate PRs.\r\n* [x] Commit message has a detailed description of what changed and why. If this PR fixes a related issue include it in the commit message. Ex: `[Fix #issue-number]`\r\n* [x] Tests are added or updated if you fix a bug or add a feature.\r\n* [x] CHANGELOG files are updated for the changed libraries if there is a behavior change or additional feature. Minor bug fixes and documentation changes should not be included.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/54686/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/54686/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":16564181885,"node_id":"REFE_lADNIULOqbL6Lc8AAAAD201bfQ","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/events/16564181885","actor":{"login":"ramimassoud","id":374033,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3NDAzMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/374033?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ramimassoud","html_url":"https://github.com/ramimassoud","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ramimassoud/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ramimassoud/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ramimassoud/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ramimassoud/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ramimassoud/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ramimassoud/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ramimassoud/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ramimassoud/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ramimassoud/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"7cb69a8fd004c94b9266f2fdb2a833d15c09192b","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ramimassoud/rails/commits/7cb69a8fd004c94b9266f2fdb2a833d15c09192b","created_at":"2025-03-04T15:31:21Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":16694917171,"node_id":"REFE_lADNIULOqbL6Lc8AAAAD4xg4Mw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/events/16694917171","actor":{"login":"ramimassoud","id":374033,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3NDAzMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/374033?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ramimassoud","html_url":"https://github.com/ramimassoud","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ramimassoud/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ramimassoud/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ramimassoud/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ramimassoud/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ramimassoud/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ramimassoud/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ramimassoud/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ramimassoud/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ramimassoud/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"09562928b3fd61ea0035f9e42cfb5f09d685fb2a","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ramimassoud/rails/commits/09562928b3fd61ea0035f9e42cfb5f09d685fb2a","created_at":"2025-03-11T18:21:44Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":16695507320,"node_id":"REFE_lADNIULOqbL6Lc8AAAAD4yE5eA","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/events/16695507320","actor":{"login":"ramimassoud","id":374033,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3NDAzMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/374033?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ramimassoud","html_url":"https://github.com/ramimassoud","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ramimassoud/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ramimassoud/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ramimassoud/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ramimassoud/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ramimassoud/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ramimassoud/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ramimassoud/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ramimassoud/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ramimassoud/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"e87af0f3235ca555f7864de9bb44da1d464d012d","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ramimassoud/rails/commits/e87af0f3235ca555f7864de9bb44da1d464d012d","created_at":"2025-03-11T18:54:50Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":16695988933,"node_id":"CE_lADNIULOqbL6Lc8AAAAD4yiSxQ","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/events/16695988933","actor":{"login":"byroot","id":44640,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0NjQw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/44640?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/byroot","html_url":"https://github.com/byroot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/byroot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/byroot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com
