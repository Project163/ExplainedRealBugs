Fix #54560\r\n- `update_all` would produce a broken query when using more than one JOIN on the target.\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nDeveloper.join(:computer, :mentor).update_all(ready: true)\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Before\r\n\r\n```sql\r\nUPDATE developers SET ready = true FROM computers JOIN mentors on mentors.id = developers.mentor_id WHERE developer.computer_id = computer.id; # We can't make a JOIN on the developer table, this should in the FROM clause.\r\n# We can't make a join on the target, that's what the FROM clause is used for.\r\n```\r\n\r\n### After\r\n\r\n```sql\r\nUPDATE developers SET ready = true FROM computers, mentors WHERE developer.computer_id = computer.id AND developers.mentor_id = mentors.id;\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Checklist\r\n\r\nBefore submitting the PR make sure the following are
