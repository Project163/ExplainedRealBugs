As soon as the job is being processed it fails with `ActiveStorage::InvariableError`.\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\nThe `ActiveStorage::TransformJob` should accept previewable files as well so preprocessed variants are also possible for PDF documents and other previewable filetypes.\r\n\r\n### Actual behavior\r\nThe `ActiveStorage::TransformJob` fails when a previewable blob is being processed with `ActiveStorage::InvariableError`\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n**Rails version**: 7.1.1\r\n\r\n**Ruby version**: 3.2.2\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"jonathanhefner","id":771968,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc3MTk2OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/771968?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonathanhefner","html_url":"https://github.com/jonathanhefner","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonathanhefner/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonathanhefner/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonathanhefner/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonathanhefner/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonathanhefner/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonathanhefner/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonathanhefner/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonathanhefner/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonathanhefner/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/50005/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/50005/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
