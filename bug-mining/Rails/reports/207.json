Create a migration and run it with `db:migrate`.\n2. Change that migration and run `db:migrate:reset`.\n\n### Expected behavior\nPrimary database must be recreated by reapplying existing migrations without using the schema. The solid_cable database, since it has no migrations in its directory, must be recreated using the schema.\n\n\n### Actual behavior\nPrimary database is working correctly, but the solid_cable database is created empty and its schema is updated to:\n\n```ruby\n# db/cable_squema.rb\nActiveRecord::Schema[8.1].define(version: 0) do\nend\n```\n\n### System configuration\n**Rails version**: 8.1.0.alpha 730367e\n**Ruby version**: ruby 3.4.2 (2025-02-15 revision d2930f8e7a) +PRISM [arm64-darwin24]\n\nRelated issues: rails/solid_queue#540 rails/rails#52829\n","closed_by":{"login":"eileencodes","id":1080678,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwODA2Nzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1080678?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/eileencodes","html_url":"https://github.com/eileencodes","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eileencodes/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eileencodes/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eileencodes/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eileencodes/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eileencodes/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eileencodes/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eileencodes/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eileencodes/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eileencodes/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/55045/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/55045/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
