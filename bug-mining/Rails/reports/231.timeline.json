https://github.com/rails/rails/issues/55771\r\n\r\n- The original code intends to avoid already persisted invalid records\r\n  from preventing new associated records from being saved.\r\n- Issue #55771 documents that this could lead to previously valid data\r\n  being saved and becoming invalid.\r\n- The code originated in https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/53951\r\n- And was updated in https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/54273\r\n- The solution suggested by @axlekb in https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/53951#pullrequestreview-3272124308\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThanks for contributing to
