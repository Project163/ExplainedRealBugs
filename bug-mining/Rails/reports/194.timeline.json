What was the end-user or developer problem that led to this PR?\r\n\r\nBundler generated binstubs are sometimes too strict, and error out directly, preventing Bundler auto-install and auto-switch mechanism from triggering.\r\n\r\nWe have two mechanisms that are almost identical for activating the proper version of Bundler, with only one difference:\r\n\r\n* One lives in [RubyGems](https://github.com/rubygems/rubygems/blob/5aa6146a645a8cd7a96a41cac8a0636943648a65/lib/rubygems/bundler_version_finder.rb#L1-L77). This puts the most appropiate Bundler version first in the list, but will fallback to other versions if not present. This mechanism is backed up by code in Bundler to automatically install the locked version of Bundler, and restart with it if the best version was not activated initially.\r\n* The other one lives in [Bundler binstubs](https://github.com/rubygems/rubygems/blob/5aa6146a645a8cd7a96a41cac8a0636943648a65/bundler/lib/bundler/templates/Executable.bundler). This actually sets a `~> x.y` constraint on the version of Bundler, so it could end up in errors.\r\n\r\nIn particular, when `vendor/bundle` is configured, and a minor version of Bundler is running that that does match the locked version of Bundler, Bundler binstubs will bail out with an error. If they were not in place, Bundler internal mechanism would automatically restart with the locked version of Bundler itself present in `vendor/bundle` and everything would just work. \r\n\r\n## What is your fix for the problem, implemented in this PR?\r\n\r\nStop generating binstubs for Bundler itself, since they are no longer necessary, given that the same (more relaxed) mechanism is present in all RubyGems version that we support.\r\n\r\n## Make sure the following tasks are checked\r\n\r\n- [x] Describe the problem / feature\r\n- [x] Write [tests](https://github.com/rubygems/rubygems/blob/master/bundler/doc/development/PULL_REQUESTS.md#tests) for features and bug fixes\r\n- [x] Write code to solve the problem\r\n- [x] Make sure you follow the [current code style](https://github.com/rubygems/rubygems/blob/master/doc/bundler/development/PULL_REQUESTS.md#code-formatting) and [write meaningful commit messages without tags](https://github.com/rubygems/rubygems/blob/master/doc/bundler/development/PULL_REQUESTS.md#commit-messages)\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ruby/rubygems/issues/8345/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":1,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ruby/rubygems/issues/8345/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/2692557944","html_url":"https://github.com/rails/rails/issues/54563#issuecomment-2692557944","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/54563","id":2692557944,"node_id":"IC_kwDNIULOoH0seA","user":{"login":"y-yagi","id":987638,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk4NzYzOA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/987638?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/y-yagi","html_url":"https://github.com/y-yagi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/y-yagi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/y-yagi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/y-yagi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/y-yagi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/y-yagi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/y-yagi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/y-yagi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/y-yagi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/y-yagi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-03-02T04:54:58Z","updated_at":"2025-03-02T04:57:59Z","body":"As Edouard described, this is because of behavior changing a Bundler.\n(I assume this may be a breaking change. https://github.com/rubygems/rubygems/pull/8345#issuecomment-2692548703)\n\n@yahonda \nI think the correct way to fix this is to avoid it depending on Binstub, but if you want to fix it temporarily or want to match the behavior of `main` and `8-0-stable`, the following patch would help.

Motivation / Background\r\n\r\n- Fix #54563\r\n- Prevent `rails new` from throwing a warning and `bin/rails g authentication` from crashing when Bundler cuts a new release.\r\n\r\n### Detail\r\n\r\nIn a future version of Bundler, running `bundle binstub bundler` will no longer generate a `bin/bundle` binstub. The reason for this change upstream is well explained in https://github.com/rubygems/rubygems/pull/8345.\r\n\r\n#### Problem\r\n\r\nWhen the change in Bundler is cut into a release, generating new rails application will throw a Bundler warning, and the AuthenticationGenerator which makes use of `bin/bundle` will stop working.\r\n\r\n#### Solution\r\n\r\nStop generating a bundler binstub and modify the generator to use the same bundler command as the rest of the codebase.\r\n\r\n### Checklist\r\n\r\nBefore submitting the PR make sure the following are checked:\r\n\r\n* [x] This Pull Request is related to one change. Unrelated changes should be opened in separate PRs.\r\n* [x] Commit message has a detailed description of what changed and why. If this PR fixes a related issue include it in the commit message.
