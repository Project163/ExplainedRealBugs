for contributing to Rails!\r\n\r\nPlease do not make *Draft* pull requests, as they still send\r\nnotifications to everyone watching the Rails repo.\r\n\r\nCreate a pull request when it is ready for review and feedback\r\nfrom the Rails team :).\r\n\r\nIf your pull request affects documentation or any non-code\r\nchanges, guidelines for those changes are [available\r\nhere](https://edgeguides.rubyonrails.org/contributing_to_ruby_on_rails.html#contributing-to-the-rails-documentation)\r\n\r\nAbout this template\r\n\r\nThe following template aims to help contributors write a good description for their pull requests.\r\nWe'd like you to provide a description of the changes in your pull request (i.e. bugs fixed or features added), motivation behind the changes, and complete the checklist below before opening a pull request.\r\n\r\nFeel free to discard it if you need to (e.g. when you just fix a typo). -->\r\n\r\n### Motivation / Background\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nDescribe why this Pull Request needs to be merged. What bug have you fixed? What feature have you added? Why is it important?\r\nIf you are fixing a specific issue, include \"Fixes #ISSUE\" (replace with the issue number, remove the quotes) and the issue will be linked to this PR.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis Pull Request has been created to fix https://github.com/rails/rails/issues/48080.\r\nAs mentioned in the issue, a regression was introduced in https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/46503 where `includes(...).order(...)` would error with `#ids` due to a `DISTINCT` that wouldn't contain the ordering columns as required by `postgres` and `mysql`.\r\n\r\nFrom the `PostgreSQL` docs:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1543\" alt=\"Screenshot 2023-05-01 at 3 16 49 pm\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/54629302/235410227-17f40e1b-afef-482a-8c87-64050c0fe52f.png\">\r\n\r\n### Detail\r\n\r\nThis Pull Request changes `ActiveRecord::Calculations#ids` to use `#group` over `#distinct` to avoid having a `DISTINCT` that would be incompatible with the selected columns.\r\n\r\nI went with this approach since:\r\n- `group` will give us the same result using the same execution plan (both use `HashAggregate`).\r\n- Including the ordering columns in the `SELECT` is not an option as we want to `SELECT` only the primary key/s for `#ids`.\r\n- The only other alternative I could think of was constructing a subquery for the above which seems overcomplicated and would probably introduce unnecessary overhead.\r\n\r\n### Additional information\r\n\r\nNot relevant to the issue but https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/46697 is a related follow up PR to the one that introduced the regression.\r\n\r\n<!-- Provide additional information such as benchmarks, reference to other repositories or alternative solutions. -->\r\n\r\n### Checklist\r\n\r\nBefore submitting the PR make sure the following are checked:\r\n\r\n* [x] This Pull Request is related to one change. Changes that are unrelated should be opened in separate PRs.\r\n* [x] Commit message has a detailed description of what changed and why. If this PR fixes a related issue include it in the commit message. Ex: `[Fix #issue-number]`\r\n* [x] Tests are added or updated if you fix a bug or add a feature.\r\n* [x] CHANGELOG files are updated for the changed libraries if there is a behavior change or additional feature. Minor bug fixes and documentation changes should not be included.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/48101/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/48101/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":9150899128,"node_id":"REFE_lADNIULOZI88Vs8AAAACIW-juA","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/events/9150899128","actor":{"login":"joshuay03","id":54629302,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0NjI5MzAy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/54629302?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshuay03","html_url":"https://github.com/joshuay03","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshuay03/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshuay03/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshuay03/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshuay03/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshuay03/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshuay03/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshuay03/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshuay03/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshuay03/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"e856d7f1a24741c5295c9e562ffaf7ee0fce6680","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/joshuay03/rails/commits/e856d7f1a24741c5295c9e562ffaf7ee0fce6680","created_at":"2023-05-03T01:08:23Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":9155618709,"node_id":"CE_lADNIULOZI88Vs8AAAACIbenlQ","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/events/9155618709","actor":{"login":"eileencodes","id":1080678,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwODA2Nzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1080678?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/eileencodes","html_url":"https://github.com/eileencodes","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eileencodes/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eileencodes/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eileencodes/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eileencodes/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eileencodes/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eileencodes/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eileencodes/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eileencodes/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eileencodes/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2023-05-03T13:33:11Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":9155624440,"node_id":"REFE_lADNIULOZI88Vs8AAAACIbe9-A","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/events/9155624440","actor":{"login":"eileencodes","id":1080678,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwODA2Nzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1080678?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/eileencodes","html_url":"https://github.com/eileencodes","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eileencodes/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eileencodes/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eileencodes/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eileencodes/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eileencodes/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eileencodes/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eileencodes/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eileencodes/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eileencodes/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"6cee8343f1dc37997dd66a04be84574505c3df59","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/commits/6cee8343f1dc37997dd66a04be84574505c3df59","created_at":"2023-05-03T13:33:43Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":9166821869,"node_id":"REFE_lADNIULOZI88Vs8AAAACImKZ7Q","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/events/9166821869","actor":{"login":"briu","id":3942920,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5NDI5MjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3942920?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/briu","html_url":"https://github.com/briu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/briu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/briu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/briu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/briu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/use
