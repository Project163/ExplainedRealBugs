It allows `Person.find(1).posts`, but _not_ `Person.find(1).posts.map(&:category)`. This fix avoids the surprise that occurs when `person.posts.first` eagerly loads the whole association rather than allowing the user to manage the child association.\r\n\r\nThis fixes a serious ordering issue. Without strict loading, `person.posts.first` is guaranteed to return the first post in primary key order. On the other hand, `person.posts.load.first` is nondeterministic. The database is not guaranteed to return in a consistent order, in particular under load with other operations occurring. This is a rude surprise when trying to use `:n_plus_one_only` mode.\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\n<!-- (Guidelines for creating a bug report are [available\r\nhere](https://edgeguides.rubyonrails.org/contributing_to_ruby_on_rails.html#creating-a-bug-report)) -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Paste your executable test case created from one of the scripts found [here](https://edgeguides.rubyonrails.org/contributing_to_ruby_on_rails.html#create-an-executable-test-case) below: -->\r\nThis can be reproduced via any `has_many` association. Here's an example using ActiveRecord test models:\r\n```ruby\r\nperson = Person.find(1)\r\nperson.strict_loading!(mode: :n_plus_one_only)\r\nperson.posts.first\r\n# SELECT * FROM posts WHERE person_id = 1; -- non-deterministic order\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\n<!-- Tell us what should happen -->\r\n```ruby\r\nperson = Person.find(1)\r\nperson.strict_loading!(mode: :n_plus_one_only)\r\nperson.posts.first # this is 1+1, not N+1\r\n# SELECT * FROM posts WHERE person_id = 1 ORDER BY id LIMIT 1;\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Actual behavior\r\n<!-- Tell us what happens instead -->\r\n```ruby\r\nperson = Person.find(1)\r\nperson.strict_loading!(mode: :n_plus_one_only)\r\nperson.posts.first\r\n# SELECT * FROM posts WHERE person_id = 1; -- non-deterministic order\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Proposed fix\r\nPlease see #48785 \r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n**Rails version**: `rails (7.0.7.2)`\r\n**Ruby version**: `ruby 3.2.2`\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"rafaelfranca","id":47848,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3ODQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47848?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelfranca","html_url":"https://github.com/rafaelfranca","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelfranca/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelfranca/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelfranca/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelfranca/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelfranca/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelfranca/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelfranca/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelfranca/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelfranca/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/49473/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/49473/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
