With the way `structure_load` is written, all `extra_args` are prepended, there is no option to append them, making it impossible to update an extension setting.\n\nIn our case we need to change a specific postgres extension setting to make the load command work, which forces us to monkey patch the `structure_load` like so:\n\n```\n  def structure_load(filename, extra_flags)\n    # The change is this monkey patch is only to prepend extra_flags instead of appending them\n    args = ['--set', 'ON_ERROR_STOP=1', '--quiet', '--no-psqlrc', '--output', File::NULL, '--file', filename]\n    args = Array(extra_flags) + args if extra_flags\n    args << db_config.database\n    run_cmd('psql', args, 'loading')\n  end\n```\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nI can chose the order of `extra_flags` relative to the `--file` parameter. \n\n### Actual behavior\n\n`extra_flags` are always set after `--file`, and will not always be taken into account by the `psql` command.\n\n### System configuration\n\n**Rails version**: Rails 7.2.2.1\n\n**Ruby version**: Ruby 3.3.7\n\n\n### Options to fix this behavior\n\n1. Update `structure_load` to prepend the `extra_flags`: I believe this could cause the opposite of my current issue to other users, I wouldn't recommend it\n2. Add a new argument to `structure_load`, with default set to nil (no breaking change), that would be `extra_flags_prepended` or something like that, and would be set the same way `structure_load_flags` is \n3. Change the structure of `structure_load`'s `extra_flags`: now instead of being an array/a hash with array value, it would be a 2-dimensional array, `[[flags_prepended], [flags_appended]]`. Breaking change but an easy fix.\n\nI'll be happy to write the fix, I'd like to know what would be the best option to do so beforehand.  \n","closed_by":{"login":"byroot","id":44640,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0NjQw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/44640?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/byroot","html_url":"https://github.com/byroot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/byroot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/byroot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/byroot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/byroot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/byroot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/byroot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/byroot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/byroot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/byroot/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/54805/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/54805/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
