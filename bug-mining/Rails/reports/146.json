However if the association is bi-directional, destroying only works from one end – and the end which succeeds depends on the order of `belongs_to` declarations in the join model.  I believe it should work from both ends.\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\n# frozen_string_literal: true\r\n\r\nrequire \"bundler/inline\"\r\n\r\ngemfile(true) do\r\n  source \"https://rubygems.org\"\r\n\r\n  git_source(:github) { |repo| \"https://github.com/#{repo}.git\" }\r\n\r\n  gem \"rails\"\r\n  gem \"sqlite3\"\r\nend\r\n\r\nrequire \"active_record\"\r\nrequire \"minitest/autorun\"\r\nrequire \"logger\"\r\n\r\nActiveRecord::Base.establish_connection(adapter: \"sqlite3\", database: \":memory:\")\r\nActiveRecord::Base.logger = Logger.new(STDOUT)\r\n\r\nActiveRecord::Schema.define do\r\n  create_table :lefts, force: true do |t|\r\n  end\r\n\r\n  create_table :rights, force: true do |t|\r\n  end\r\n\r\n  create_table :middles, force: true do |t|\r\n    t.references :left, foreign_key: true\r\n    t.references :right, foreign_key: true\r\n  end\r\nend\r\n\r\nclass Left < ActiveRecord::Base\r\n  has_one :middle, dependent: :destroy\r\n  has_one :right, through: :middle\r\nend\r\n\r\nclass Middle < ActiveRecord::Base\r\n  belongs_to :left, dependent: :destroy\r\n  belongs_to :right, dependent: :destroy\r\nend\r\n\r\nclass Right < ActiveRecord::Base\r\n  has_one :middle, dependent: :destroy\r\n  has_one :left, through: :middle\r\nend\r\n\r\nclass BugTest < Minitest::Test\r\n  def test_destroying_left_destroys_right\r\n    left = Left.create!\r\n    right = Right.create!\r\n    middle = Middle.create! left: left, right: right\r\n\r\n    left.destroy\r\n    assert right.destroyed?\r\n  end\r\n\r\n  def test_destroying_right_destroys_left\r\n    left = Left.create!\r\n    right = Right.create!\r\n    middle = Middle.create! left: left, right: right\r\n\r\n    right.destroy\r\n    assert left.destroyed?\r\n  end\r\nend\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\n\r\nI expect:\r\n\r\n- `left.destroy` to also destroy its `middle` and its `right`\r\n- `right.destroy` to also destroy its `middle` and its `left`\r\n\r\n### Actual behavior\r\n\r\n- `right.destroy` destroys its `middle` and its `left`\r\n-  `left.destroy` destroys its `middle` but does not destroy its `right`\r\n\r\nHowever if I reverse the order of `Middle`'s `belongs_to` declarations, `right.destroy` stops working and `left.destroy` starts working.\r\n\r\n### Patch\r\n\r\nThis patch fixes the behaviour and does not break any existing tests (via `bundle exec rake test:sqlite3`):\r\n\r\n```diff\r\ndiff --git i/activerecord/lib/active_record/callbacks.rb w/activerecord/lib/active_record/callbacks.rb\r\nindex 29c72d1024..6e9c68b747 100644\r\n--- i/activerecord/lib/active_record/callbacks.rb\r\n+++ w/activerecord/lib/active_record/callbacks.rb\r\n@@ -418,7 +418,7 @@ module ClassMethods\r\n \r\n     def destroy # :nodoc:\r\n       @_destroy_callback_already_called ||= false\r\n-      return if @_destroy_callback_already_called\r\n+      return true if @_destroy_callback_already_called\r\n       @_destroy_callback_already_called = true\r\n       _run_destroy_callbacks { super }\r\n     rescue RecordNotDestroyed => e\r\n```\r\n\r\nCredit for the patch belongs to [Alex](https://stackoverflow.com/a/77917179/151007).\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\n**Rails version**: 7.1.3\r\n\r\n**Ruby version**: 3.3.0\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"byroot","id":44640,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0NjQw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/44640?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/byroot","html_url":"https://github.com/byroot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/byroot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/byroot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/byroot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/byroot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/byroot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/byroot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/byroot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/byroot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/byroot/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/50948/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/50948/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
