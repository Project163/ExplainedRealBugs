Motivation / Background\r\n\r\nIssue https://github.com/rails/rails/issues/49796\r\n\r\n### Detail\r\n\r\nDuring investigation of the issue above I found that `Rails.cache.fetch` in case when no options were passed as arguments passes global cache options to fetch block (wrapped in WriteOptions, but anyway), so, global cache options will be overwritten by those manipulations.\r\n\r\n### Additional information\r\n\r\nLet me know if I need to update changelog\r\n\r\n### Checklist\r\n\r\nBefore submitting the PR make sure the following are checked:\r\n\r\n* [x] This Pull Request is
