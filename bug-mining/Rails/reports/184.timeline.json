for contributing to Rails!\r\n\r\nPlease do not make *Draft* pull requests, as they still send\r\nnotifications to everyone watching the Rails repo.\r\n\r\nCreate a pull request when it is ready for review and feedback\r\nfrom the Rails team :).\r\n\r\nIf your pull request affects documentation or any non-code\r\nchanges, guidelines for those changes are [available\r\nhere](https://edgeguides.rubyonrails.org/contributing_to_ruby_on_rails.html#contributing-to-the-rails-documentation)\r\n\r\nAbout this template\r\n\r\nThe following template aims to help contributors write a good description for their pull requests.\r\nWe'd like you to provide a description of the changes in your pull request (i.e. bugs fixed or features added), the motivation behind the changes, and complete the checklist below before opening a pull request.\r\n\r\nFeel free to discard it if you need to (e.g. when you just fix a typo). -->\r\n\r\n### Motivation / Background\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nDescribe why this Pull Request needs to be merged. What bug have you fixed? What feature have you added? Why is it important?\r\nIf you are fixing a specific issue, include \"Fixes #ISSUE\" (replace with the issue number, remove the quotes) and the issue will be linked to this PR.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nFixes #54471\r\n\r\n### Detail\r\n\r\n`t.exclusion_constraint` and `t.unique_constraint` are extensions available only for the PostgreSQL adapter. These delegate the given arguments to `SchemaStatements#add_exclusion_constraint` etc., but the current implementation receives all arguments as an array, so keyword arguments cannot be passed correctly.\r\nAs a result, method calls that pass keyword arguments always result in an argument error.\r\n\r\nThis change fixes this issue by forwarding arguments using `...`.\r\n\r\nCurrently, `t.validate_constraint` and `t.validate_check_constraint` do not accept keyword arguments, but we changes them in preparation for the future.\r\n\r\n### Additional information\r\n\r\n<!-- Provide additional information such as benchmarks, references to other repositories, or alternative solutions. -->\r\n\r\n### Checklist\r\n\r\nBefore submitting the PR make sure the following are checked:\r\n\r\n* [x] This Pull Request is related to one change. Unrelated changes should be opened in separate PRs.\r\n* [x] Commit message has a detailed description of what changed and why. If this PR fixes a related issue include it in the commit message. Ex: `[Fix #issue-number]`\r\n* [x] Tests are added or updated if you fix a bug or add a feature.\r\n* [x] CHANGELOG files are updated for the changed libraries if there is a behavior change or additional feature. Minor bug fixes and documentation changes should not be included.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/54472/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/54472/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":16235854411,"node_id":"REFE_lADNIULOqUeFtM8AAAADx7t6Sw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/events/16235854411","actor":{"login":"wata727","id":9624059,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk2MjQwNTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9624059?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wata727","html_url":"https://github.com/wata727","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wata727/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wata727/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wata727/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wata727/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wata727/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wata727/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wata727/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wata727/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wata727/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"eaab3e08353c5d428dbc10d997d98eda1514c8e9","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/wata727/rails/commits/eaab3e08353c5d428dbc10d997d98eda1514c8e9","created_at":"2025-02-08T15:58:23Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":16235897379,"node_id":"CE_lADNIULOqUeFtM8AAAADx7wiIw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/events/16235897379","actor":{"login":"fatkodima","id":5657035,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTcwMzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5657035?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fatkodima","html_url":"https://github.com/fatkodima","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fatkodima/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fatkodima/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fatkodima/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fatkodima/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fatkodima/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fatkodima/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fatkodima/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fatkodima/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fatkodima/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2025-02-08T16:10:48Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":16235897384,"node_id":"CE_lADNIULOqUeFtM8AAAADx7wiKA","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/events/16235897384","actor":{"login":"fatkodima","id":5657035,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTcwMzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5657035?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fatkodima","html_url":"https://github.com/fatkodima","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fatkodima/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fatkodima/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fatkodima/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fatkodima/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fatkodima/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fatkodima/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fatkodima/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fatkodima/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fatkodima/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":"eaab3e08353c5d428dbc10d997d98eda1514c8e9","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/commits/eaab3e08353c5d428dbc10d997d98eda1514c8e9","created_at":"2025-02-08T16:10:48Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
