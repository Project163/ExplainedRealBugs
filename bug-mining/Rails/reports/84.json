Bummer.\r\n\r\n<!-- Paste your executable test case created from one of the scripts found [here](https://edgeguides.rubyonrails.org/contributing_to_ruby_on_rails.html#create-an-executable-test-case) below: -->\r\n```\r\n  my_object.errors.attribute_keys.each { |key| my_object.errors.delete(key) } # because errors has no clear method!  I checked the docs.\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\nI should see docs for methods that exist - even if using them is unusual and part of some maybe dubious code?\r\n\r\n### Actual behavior\r\nTry `my_object.errors.clear`.
