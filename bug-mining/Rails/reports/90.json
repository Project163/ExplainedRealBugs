Starting in rails 7.1, referencing this class name in a helper test which inherits from ActionView::TestCase causes an exception NoMethodError from ActionView::TestCase::Behavior::Content:Class when, as in this example, calling certain Active Record methods with the object Content as the receiver.\r\n\r\nThis exception occurs only in tests which inherit from ActionView::TestCase.  The class name works correctly in other tests and in the app itself.\r\n\r\nThis seems to have come from #49194 (but don't hold me to that). It occurs in 7.1.0, 7.1.1, and in the main branch.\r\n\r\n```\r\n# frozen_string_literal: true\r\n\r\nrequire \"bundler/inline\"\r\n\r\ngemfile(true) do\r\n  source \"https://rubygems.org\"\r\n\r\n  git_source(:github) { |repo| \"https://github.com/#{repo}.git\" }\r\n\r\n  # Activate the gem you are reporting the issue against.\r\n  # gem \"rails\", \"~> 7.1.0\"\r\n  gem \"rails\", \"~> 7.1.1\"\r\n  # gem \"rails\", github: \"rails/rails\", branch: \"main\"\r\n  gem \"sqlite3\"\r\nend\r\n\r\nrequire \"active_record\"\r\nrequire \"action_view\"\r\nrequire \"minitest/autorun\"\r\nrequire \"logger\"\r\n\r\n# This connection will do for database-independent bug reports.\r\nActiveRecord::Base.establish_connection(adapter: \"sqlite3\", database: \":memory:\")\r\nActiveRecord::Base.logger = Logger.new(STDOUT)\r\n\r\nActiveRecord::Schema.define do\r\n  create_table :contents, force: true do |t|\r\n    t.string \"title\"\r\n  end\r\nend\r\n\r\nclass Content < ActiveRecord::Base\r\nend\r\n\r\nclass ContentsHelperTest < ActionView::TestCase\r\n  def test_content\r\n    # new method works\r\n    Content.new(title: 'New Content')\r\n\r\n    # either of these cause an exception\r\n    # Content.create!(title: 'First')\r\n    Content.first\r\n  end\r\nend\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\nExisting classes named Content should be usable in tests inheriting from ActionView::TestCase\r\n\r\n### Actual behavior\r\nUsing an object named Content as the receiver in certain Active Record method calls mistakenly goes to ActionView::TestCase::Behavior::Content:Class.  \r\n\r\n```\r\n# Running:\r\n\r\nE\r\n\r\nError:\r\nContentsHelperTest#test_content:\r\nNoMethodError: undefined method `first' for ActionView::TestCase::Behavior::Content:Class\r\n    content-bug.rb:49:in `test_content'\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\nRails 7.0, 7.1, Main\r\n\r\n**Ruby version**:\r\nruby 3.2.2 (2023-03-30 revision e51014f9c0) +YJIT [x86_64-darwin19]","closed_by":{"login":"rafaelfranca","id":47848,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3ODQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47848?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelfranca","html_url":"https://github.com/rafaelfranca","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelfranca/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelfranca/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelfranca/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelfranca/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelfranca/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelfranca/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelfranca/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelfranca/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelfranca/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/49818/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/49818/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
