Changes that are unrelated should be opened in separate PRs.\r\n* [x] Commit message has a detailed description of what changed and why. If this PR fixes a related issue include it in the commit message. Ex: `[Fix #issue-number]`\r\n* [x] Tests are added or updated if you fix a bug or add a feature.\r\n* [x] CHANGELOG files are updated for the changed libraries if there is a behavior change or additional feature. Minor bug fixes and documentation changes should not be included.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/49847/reactions","total_count":4,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":2,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/49847/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/2222046314","html_url":"https://github.com/rails/rails/issues/52304#issuecomment-2222046314","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/52304","id":2222046314,"node_id":"IC_kwDNIULOhHG8ag","user":{"login":"ghiculescu","id":509837,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwOTgzNw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/509837?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghiculescu","html_url":"https://github.com/ghiculescu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghiculescu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghiculescu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghiculescu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghiculescu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghiculescu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghiculescu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghiculescu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghiculescu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghiculescu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-07-11T05:10:52Z","updated_at":"2024-07-11T05:10:52Z","body":"btw I noticed that if you remove the `validate: true`s from the model definitions, the test passes.

for contributing to Rails!\r\n\r\nPlease do not make *Draft* pull requests, as they still send\r\nnotifications to everyone watching the Rails repo.\r\n\r\nCreate a pull request when it is ready for review and feedback\r\nfrom the Rails team :).\r\n\r\nIf your pull request affects documentation or any non-code\r\nchanges, guidelines for those changes are [available\r\nhere](https://edgeguides.rubyonrails.org/contributing_to_ruby_on_rails.html#contributing-to-the-rails-documentation)\r\n\r\nAbout this template\r\n\r\nThe following template aims to help contributors write a good description for their pull requests.\r\nWe'd like you to provide a description of the changes in your pull request (i.e. bugs fixed or features added), the motivation behind the changes, and complete the checklist below before opening a pull request.\r\n\r\nFeel free to discard it if you need to (e.g. when you just fix a typo). -->\r\n\r\n### Motivation / Background\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nDescribe why this Pull Request needs to be merged. What bug have you fixed? What feature have you added? Why is it important?\r\nIf you are fixing a specific issue, include \"Fixes #ISSUE\" (replace with the issue number, remove the quotes) and the issue will be linked to this PR.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nFixes https://github.com/rails/rails/issues/52304\r\nRef: https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/49847\r\n\r\n### Detail\r\n\r\nAdds a condition in `ActiveRecord::AutosaveAssociation#inverse_belongs_to_association_for` to return early if the current reflection is a `belongs_to`, as the inverse can't possibly be a `belongs_to` as well. This then ensures that polymorphic `belongs_to` reflections don't have their class computed which raises an error like the one in the linked issue (see https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/31895 for why this happens).\r\n\r\nAn alternative fix, specifically for the linked issue is to simply return if `reflection.polymorphic?`, but imo what I've currently got is better since it handles non-polymorphic cases as well, and will short circuit in all cases where the inverse logic is not applicable.\r\n\r\n**Edit:** Some more context in https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/52305#issuecomment-2222227506\r\n\r\n### Additional information\r\n\r\n<!-- Provide additional information such as benchmarks, references to other repositories, or alternative solutions. -->\r\n\r\n### Checklist\r\n\r\nBefore submitting the PR make sure the following are checked:\r\n\r\n* [x] This Pull Request is related to one change. Unrelated changes should be opened in separate PRs.\r\n* [x] Commit message has a detailed description of what changed and why. If this PR fixes a related issue include it in the commit message. Ex: `[Fix #issue-number]`\r\n* [x] Tests are added or updated if you fix a bug or add a feature.\r\n* [ ] CHANGELOG files are updated for the changed libraries if there is a behavior change or additional feature. Minor bug fixes and documentation changes should not be included.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/52305/reactions","total_count":3,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":3,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/52305/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":13466531547,"node_id":"REFE_lADNIULOjy-Mis8AAAADIqr22w","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/events/13466531547","actor":{"login":"joshuay03","id":54629302,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0NjI5MzAy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/54629302?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshuay03","html_url":"https://github.com/joshuay03","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshuay03/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshuay03/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshuay03/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshuay03/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshuay03/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshuay03/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshuay03/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshuay03/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshuay03/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"e28173f1c27dcf81342ca650560ec97e660b0e06","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/joshuay03/rails/commits/e28173f1c27dcf81342ca650560ec97e660b0e06","created_at":"2024-07-11T06:12:16Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/2222115245","html_url":"https://github.com/rails/rails/issues/52304#issuecomment-2222115245","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/52304","id":2222115245,"node_id":"IC_kwDNIULOhHLJrQ","user":{"login":"joshuay03","id":54629302,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0NjI5MzAy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/54629302?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshuay03","html_url":"https://github.com/joshuay03","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshuay03/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshuay03/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshuay03/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshuay03/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshuay03/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshuay03/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshuay03/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshuay03/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshuay03/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-07-11T06:13:09Z","updated_at":"2024-07-11T06:13:09Z","body":"Got

for contributing to Rails!\r\n\r\nPlease do not make *Draft* pull requests, as they still send\r\nnotifications to everyone watching the Rails repo.\r\n\r\nCreate a pull request when it is ready for review and feedback\r\nfrom the Rails team :).\r\n\r\nIf your pull request affects documentation or any non-code\r\nchanges, guidelines for those changes are [available\r\nhere](https://edgeguides.rubyonrails.org/contributing_to_ruby_on_rails.html#contributing-to-the-rails-documentation)\r\n\r\nAbout this template\r\n\r\nThe following template aims to help contributors write a good description for their pull requests.\r\nWe'd like you to provide a description of the changes in your pull request (i.e. bugs fixed or features added), the motivation behind the changes, and complete the checklist below before opening a pull request.\r\n\r\nFeel free to discard it if you need to (e.g. when you just fix a typo). -->\r\n\r\n### Motivation / Background\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nDescribe why this Pull Request needs to be merged. What bug have you fixed? What feature have you added? Why is it important?\r\nIf you are fixing a specific issue, include \"Fixes #ISSUE\" (replace with the issue number, remove the quotes) and the issue will be linked to this PR.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nRefs:\r\n- Original issue: https://github.com/rails/rails/issues/48688\r\n- Original fix: https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/49847\r\n\r\nImplements an alternative fix to the one above.\r\n\r\n### Detail\r\n\r\nThe original fix introduced some regressions:\r\n\r\n1. https://github.com/rails/rails/issues/52304 which was fixed in https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/52305\r\n2. https://github.com/rails/rails/issues/52332 which was fixed in https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/52333\r\n3. https://github.com/rails/rails/issues/52332#issuecomment-2245522368 which will be fixed here\r\n\r\nThe root cause for 2 and 3 is that the current implementation can't differentiate between these two scenarios:\r\n\r\n```\r\nchild saved -> child autosaves parent -> parent autosaves child # original issue\r\nparent saved -> parent autosaves child # new regression\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn both these cases, the current implementation avoids validating or autosaving the child if the parent association has been updated. However, it's unable to differentiate whether that update happened as a result of a direct validate/save (new regression), or an validate/autosave by the child itself (original issue).\r\n\r\nThis PR ensures that the duplicate validation/autosave of the child is only avoided if it originated from the validating/autosaving of the parent by the child.\r\n\r\n### Additional information\r\n\r\n<!-- Provide additional information such as benchmarks, references to other repositories, or alternative solutions. -->\r\n\r\n### Checklist\r\n\r\nBefore submitting the PR make sure the following are checked:\r\n\r\n* [x] This Pull Request is related to one change.
