Prior to this commit, if no default task was defined (for example, if an app was generated with `--skip-test` and didn't define its own default task), `Rails::Command::RakeCommand` would raise `UnrecognizedCommandError`, preventing Rake from displaying the task list.\r\n\r\nThis commit changes `Rails::Command::RakeCommand` to let Rake handle the \"default\" task.\r\n\r\nFixes #50700.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/50799/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/50799/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":11531541225,"node_id":"CE_lADNIULOe7G3fc8AAAACr1Va6Q","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/events/11531541225","actor":{"login":"jonathanhefner","id":771968,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc3MTk2OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/771968?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonathanhefner","html_url":"https://github.com/jonathanhefner","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonathanhefner/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonathanhefner/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonathanhefner/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonathanhefner/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonathanhefner/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonathanhefner/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonathanhefner/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonathanhefner/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonathanhefner/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2024-01-19T00:43:19Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":11532333041,"node_id":"REFE_lADNIULOe7G3fc8AAAACr2Fv8Q","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/events/11532333041","actor":{"login":"jonathanhefner","id":771968,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc3MTk2OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/771968?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonathanhefner","html_url":"https://github.com/jonathanhefner","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonathanhefner/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonathanhefner/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonathanhefner/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonathanhefner/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonathanhefner/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonathanhefner/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonathanhefner/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonathanhefner/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonathanhefner/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"faaadb19d1053d4f5712f26638c7f68368568e91","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jonathanhefner/rails/commits/faaadb19d1053d4f5712f26638c7f68368568e91","created_at":"2024-01-19T03:20:57Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":12227471994,"node_id":"REFE_lADNIULOe7G3fc8AAAAC2NBqeg","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/events/12227471994","actor":{"login":"viralpraxis","id":39729785,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5NzI5Nzg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/39729785?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/viralpraxis","html_url":"https://github.com/viralpraxis","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viralpraxis/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viralpraxis/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viralpraxis/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viralpraxis/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viralpraxis/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viralpraxis/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viralpraxis/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viralpraxis/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viralpraxis/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"06a81dc4701ceeb5c5333acc5464a139d64eb306","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/viralpraxis/rails/commits/06a81dc4701ceeb5c5333acc5464a139d64eb306","created_at":"2024-03-24T20:07:33Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":16620120575,"node_id":"REFE_lADNIULOe7G3fc8AAAAD3qLp_w","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/events/16620120575","actor":{"login":"yoones","id":1333898,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMzM4OTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1333898?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yoones","html_url":"https://github.com/yoones","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yoones/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yoones/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yoones/gists{/gist_id}"
