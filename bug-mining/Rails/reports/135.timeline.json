Motivation / Background\r\nFixes #52704 \r\n\r\nThis Pull Request has been created because the devcontainer generator with the --dev option fails (`rails g devcontainer --dev`).  The app generator --dev works just fine.\r\n\r\n### Detail\r\n\r\nThis Pull request moves the `Rails::Generators::RAILS_DEV_PATH` definition to Rails::Generators module rather than adding it to Rails::Generators in AppGenerator definition. It also creates a DEV_RAILS_PATH constant in `railties/test/generators/generators_test_helper.rb`, so that it can be used consistently in tests.\r\n\r\n### Additional information\r\n\r\n- I added a generator test file, it seems the generator is not tested for the `rails generate` usage, though it is well tested via app generator. I added tests for the dev option behavior only. I can work on full specs, but will keep it separate from this.\r\n\r\n### Checklist\r\n\r\nBefore submitting the PR make sure the following are checked:\r\n\r\n* [x] This Pull Request is related to one change. Unrelated changes should be opened in separate PRs.\r\n* [x] Commit message has a detailed description of what changed and why. If this PR fixes a related issue include it in the commit message. Ex: `[Fix #issue-number]`\r\n* [x] Tests are added or updated if you fix a bug or add a feature.\r\n* [ ] CHANGELOG files are updated for the changed libraries if there is a behavior change or additional feature. Minor bug fixes and documentation changes should not be included.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/52705/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/52705/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/2308713265","html_url":"https://github.com/rails/rails/issues/52704#issuecomment-2308713265","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/52704","id":2308713265,"node_id":"IC_kwDNIULOiZwrMQ","user":{"login":"jeromedalbert","id":236461,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzNjQ2MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/236461?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeromedalbert","html_url":"https://github.com/jeromedalbert","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeromedalbert/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeromedalbert/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeromedalbert/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeromedalbert/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeromedalbert/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeromedalbert/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeromedalbert/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeromedalbert/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeromedalbert/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-08-25T07:29:20Z","updated_at":"2024-08-25T07:36:55Z","body":"The

NOTE: I think that this may have something to do with https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/51880\r\n\r\nThis is correct, that PR introduced the devcontainer generator and command, with commit

has.\r\n\r\n","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/2308740688/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"jeromedalbert","id":236461,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzNjQ2MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/236461?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeromedalbert","html_url":"https://github.com/jeromedalbert","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeromedalbert/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeromedalbert/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeromedalbert/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeromedalbert/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeromedalbert/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeromedalbert/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeromedalbert/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeromedalbert/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeromedalbert/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":14004547330,"node_id":"REFE_lADNIULOlB9BLM8AAAADQrxvAg","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/events/14004547330","actor":{"login":"thejonroberts","id":28872849,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4ODcyODQ5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/28872849?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/thejonroberts","html_url":"https://github.com/thejonroberts","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thejonroberts/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thejonroberts/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thejonroberts/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thejonroberts/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thejonroberts/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thejonroberts/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thejonroberts/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thejonroberts/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thejonroberts/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"673feaf9b94f20831dcb99d94d83b1b476e6251e","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/thejonroberts/rails/commits/673feaf9b94f20831dcb99d94d83b1b476e6251e","created_at":"2024-08-25T14:58:08Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":14004622743,"node_id":"REFE_lADNIULOlB9BLM8AAAADQr2Vlw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/events/14004622743","actor":{"login":"thejonroberts","id":28872849,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4ODcyODQ5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/28872849?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/thejonroberts","html_url":"https://github.com/thejonroberts","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thejonroberts/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thejonroberts/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thejonroberts/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thejonroberts/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thejonroberts/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thejonroberts/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thejonroberts/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thejonroberts/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thejonroberts/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"2f27b66c9a3c016602c87f9643ddd7d63337e982","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/thejonroberts/rails/commits/2f27b66c9a3c016602c87f9643ddd7d63337e982","created_at":"2024-08-25T15:28:58Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":14005194254,"node_id":"REFE_lADNIULOlB9BLM8AAAADQsZODg","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/events/14005194254","actor":{"login":"thejonroberts","id":28872849,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4ODcyODQ5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/28872849?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/thejonroberts","html_url":"https://github.com/thejonroberts","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thejonroberts/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thejonroberts/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thejonroberts/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thejonroberts/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thejonroberts/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thejonroberts/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thejonrobert

Thanks for the report and the PR.\r\n\r\nYes, you are right, I did not intend for `bin/rails g devcontainer` to be how this generator is used. Instead, people should use `bin/rails devcontainer` which will infer the correct options needed for their application. I am going to open a PR to fix that.\r\n\r\nHowever, I think your PR is still appropriate since we should break that implicit dependency between the dev container generator and app generator and not leave it to potentially cause an issue in the future.\r\n\r\nAs for the tests, originally the dev container generator was just part of the app generator, which is why the tests are so thorough there. Later on I extracted the dev container generator itself and just wrote tests for the command. But I left the app generator tests as they were. My plan was to come back later on and fix up these tests - we need to keep testing that the app generator generates the right options for the dev container, but we should also probably test the dev container generator directly. I haven't gotten to that though, so if you are motivated to do it go for it, otherwise I will sometime soon.\r\n\r\nLast, as for using the `--dev` flag with `bin/rails devcontainer` - right now it won't work, since the devcontainer command doesn't parse options. I hadn't really thought this would be a common use case. I implemented the `--dev` pretty much for myself to help test changes to the dev container generator locally, and for CI. Since the dev container command is for generating a container for an existing app, I think that an app would not want to be using a local checkout of rails by default, so I am inclined not to add the option. But please let me know more about your use case if you'd like.","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/2312657714/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"andrewn617","id":39735028,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5NzM1MDI4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/39735028?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewn617","html_url":"https://github.com/andrewn617","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewn617/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewn617/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewn617/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewn617/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewn617/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewn617/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewn617/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewn617/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewn617/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":14029443474,"node_id":"MEE_lADNIULOlB9BLM8AAAADRDhRkg","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/events/14029443474","actor":{"login":"thejonroberts","id":28872849,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4ODcyODQ5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/28872849?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/thejonroberts","html_url":"https://github.com/thejonroberts","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thejonroberts/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thejonroberts/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thejonroberts/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thejonroberts/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thejonroberts/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thejonroberts/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thejonroberts/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thejonroberts/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thejonroberts/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2024-08-27T14:02:53Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":14029443493,"node_id":"SE_lADNIULOlB9BLM8AAAADRDhRpQ","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/events/14029443493","actor":{"login":"thejonroberts","id":28872849,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4ODcyODQ5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/28872849?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/thejonroberts","html_url":"https://github.com/thejonroberts","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thejonroberts/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thejonroberts/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thejonroberts/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thejonroberts/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thejonroberts/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thejonroberts/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thejonroberts/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thejonroberts/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thejonroberts/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2024-08-27T14:02:53Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/2312707764","html_url":"https://github.com/rails/rails/issues/52704#issuecomment-2312707764","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/52704","id":2312707764,"node_id":"IC_kwDNIULOidketA","user":{"login":"thejonroberts","id":28872849,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4ODcyODQ5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/28872849?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/thejonroberts","html_url":"https://github.com/thejonroberts","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thejonroberts/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thejonroberts/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thejonroberts/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thejonroberts/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thejonroberts/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thejonroberts/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thejonroberts/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thejonroberts/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thejonroberts/received_events","type":"User"

for contributing to Rails!\r\n\r\nPlease do not make *Draft* pull requests, as they still send\r\nnotifications to everyone watching the Rails repo.\r\n\r\nCreate a pull request when it is ready for review and feedback\r\nfrom the Rails team :).\r\n\r\nIf your pull request affects documentation or any non-code\r\nchanges, guidelines for those changes are [available\r\nhere](https://edgeguides.rubyonrails.org/contributing_to_ruby_on_rails.html#contributing-to-the-rails-documentation)\r\n\r\nAbout this template\r\n\r\nThe following template aims to help contributors write a good description for their pull requests.\r\nWe'd like you to provide a description of the changes in your pull request (i.e. bugs fixed or features added), the motivation behind the changes, and complete the checklist below before opening a pull request.\r\n\r\nFeel free to discard it if you need to (e.g. when you just fix a typo). -->\r\n\r\n### Motivation / Background\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nDescribe why this Pull Request needs to be merged. What bug have you fixed? What feature have you added? Why is it important?\r\nIf you are fixing a specific issue, include \"Fixes #ISSUE\" (replace with the issue number, remove the quotes) and the issue will be linked to this PR.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThe devcontainer generator is primarily intended to be used with the devcontainer command, which infers the correct options based on the application configuration. From https://github.com/rails/rails/issues/52704 I realized people are using `bin/rails g devcontainer` which is less optimal, since it requires the user to pass the correct options.\r\n\r\n### Detail\r\n\r\nLet's hide the devcontainer namespace from the generate command. This doesn't actually prevent the generator from being used this way, but we don't want to advertise it, since the command will lead to a better experience for the typical user.\r\n\r\n### Additional information\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Checklist\r\n\r\nBefore submitting the PR make sure the following are checked:\r\n\r\n* [x] This Pull Request is related to one change. Unrelated changes should be opened in separate PRs.\r\n* [x] Commit message has a detailed description of what changed and why. If this PR fixes a related issue include it in the commit message.

Motivation / Background\r\n\r\nThis PR adds tests for the devcontainer generator.\r\n\r\nDuring discussion with @andrewn617  in #52704, we decided that although the generator is tested via the app generator, and now hidden from the generator list in favor of the devcontainer command, it would still be beneficial to test it directly.\r\n\r\n### Detail\r\n\r\nI took the devcontainer tests from `railties/test/generators/app_generator_test.rb`, copied them over, and split them up by option, and tidied up.\r\n\r\nTests for all of the possible option values, plus a shared test for configuration that should not vary due to options. The common test is run against the default generator, and then every time an argument is used. May be overkill, but I don't think these tests are expensive\r\n\r\n### Checklist\r\n\r\nBefore submitting the PR make sure the following are checked:\r\n\r\n* [x] This Pull Request is related to one change. Unrelated changes should be opened in separate PRs.\r\n* [x] Commit message has a detailed description of what changed and why. If this PR fixes a related issue include it in the commit message. Ex: `[Fix #issue-number]`\r\n* [x] Tests are added or updated ~~if you fix a bug or add a feature~~.\r\n* [ ] ~~CHANGELOG files are updated for the changed libraries if there is a behavior change or additional feature. Minor bug fixes and documentation changes should not be included.~~\r\n\r\n### Additional Notes\r\n\r\nI have found one issue with `application_system_test_case` modification. The generator uses `gsub_file` in such a way that it is not idempotent, and gets **pretty messed up** on the second run.  I started to add a test for it, but didn't want to get stuck on that here. I can add a separate issue if need be. Here was the start of my test for that, if anyone wants to try it out:\r\n```ruby\r\ndef test_system_test_option_idempotent\r\n  copy_application_system_test_case\r\n\r\n  run_generator\r\n\r\n  assert_file(\"test/application_system_test_case.rb\") do |system_test_case|\r\n    assert_match(/^  if ENV\\[\"CAPYBARA_SERVER_PORT\"\\]/, system_test_case)\r\n    assert_match(/^    served_by host: \"rails-app\", port: ENV\\[\"CAPYBARA_SERVER_PORT\"\\]/, system_test_case)\r\n    assert_match(/^    driven_by :selenium, using: :headless_chrome, screen_size: \\[ 1400, 1400 \\], options: {$/, system_test_case)\r\n    assert_match(/^      browser: :remote,$/, system_test_case)\r\n    assert_match(/^      url: \"http:\\/\\/\\#{ENV\\[\"SELENIUM_HOST\"\\]}:4444\"$/, system_test_case)\r\n  end\r\n\r\n  run_generator\r\n  assert_file(\"test/application_system_test_case.rb\") do |system_test_case|\r\n    # TODO: assert only one\r\n    # assert_match(/^  if ENV\\[\"CAPYBARA_SERVER_PORT\"\\]/, system_test_case)\r\n  end\r\nend\r\n```\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/52752/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/52752/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"actor":{"login":"katelovescode","id":8364647,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgzNjQ2NDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8364647?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/katelovescode","html_url":"https://github.com/katelovescode","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/katelovescode/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/katelovescode/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/katelovescode/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/katelovescode/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/katelovescode/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/katelovescode/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/katelovescode/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/katelovescode/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/katelovescode/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-09-08T21:34:35Z","updated_at":"2024-09-08T21:34:35Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/52835","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/52835/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/52835/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/52835/events","html_url":"https://github.com/rails/rails/issues/52835","id":2512583674,"node_id":"I_kwDNIULOlcL7-g","number":52835,"title":"Server

Steps to reproduce\r\n```bash\r\n$ mkdir thalia\r\n$ cd thalia\r\nthalia $ echo \"3.3.5\" >> .ruby-version\r\nthalia $ gem install rails\r\nSuccessfully installed rails-7.2.1\r\n1 gem installed\r\nthalia $ rails new . -T --skip-rubocop -d postgresql --devcontainer\r\n```\r\nGeneration output has no unexpected output (except the `ostruct` warning and `turbo:install:redis` instructions)\r\n\r\n* go to VSCode, app has been generated successfully\r\n* run the Rebuild & Reopen in Container command, postCreateCommand runs\r\n  * successful dependencies\r\n  * successful database preparation\r\n  * successful log & tempfile removal\r\n  * successful app server restart\r\n  * \"press any key to close the terminal\" - when I press a key it goes to the terminal as expected\r\n\r\nLooking at the Ports tab, 3000, 5432, and 6379 are being forwarded, no running process is listed\r\n<img width=\"708\" alt=\"Screenshot 2024-09-08 at 4 27 18 PM\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fc2ff97a-688b-48ee-9e88-2f5fcb4a3c1b\">\r\n\r\nI've double checked that I have no hanging/cached images, volumes, containers, networks, etc. in Docker\r\n\r\nBut port 3000 is in use:\r\n```bash\r\nthalia $ lsof -i TCP:3000\r\nCOMMAND    PID USER   FD   TYPE             DEVICE SIZE/OFF NODE NAME\r\nCode\\x20H 4356 me   26u  IPv4 0xac7d33f83c873571      0t0  TCP localhost:hbci (LISTEN)\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\n<!-- Tell us what should happen -->\r\n\r\nVisiting localhost:3000 should load the Rails app.  According to https://github.com/rails/rails/issues/52704 it sounds like the app generator is supposed to work & is fully tested, so I wonder if I'm using it wrong?\r\n\r\n### Actual behavior\r\n<!-- Tell us what happens instead -->\r\n\r\nVisiting localhost:3000 hangs, with no terminal/log information (at least not where I can find it) - same goes for 127.0.0.1:3000\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n**Rails version**: 7.2.1\r\n\r\n**Ruby version**:
