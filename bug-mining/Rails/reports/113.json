The way it works is that you copy and paste part of the code from a previous migration and wrap it in that `revert` block. Then, rails automatically does the opposite of what is included there. So, that part I think I understand.\r\n\r\nSo now, back to the text at the end. The steps listed are:\r\n```\r\n    1. Reverse the order of create_table and reversible.\r\n    2. Replace create_table with drop_table.\r\n    3. Finally, replace up with down and vice-versa.\r\n```\r\nHere's what I don't get: that second code example in the docs section that demonstrates the use of revert to selectively revert part of a migration does not involve dropping any table. It would make sense to me if that copy-pasted code included a create_table statement, but it doesn't. So, to my understanding, the steps listed with that last statement don't make sense.\r\n\r\nFor more context, the `ExampleMigration` referred to in that second code example appears to refer to a migration mentioned further up in the docs in another section, [here](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/active_record_migrations.html#using-reversible).\r\n\r\n**It has been pointed out to me that the code example did originally have a `create_table` call, as you can see [here](https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/c4c3a44685b4cfb1ffd4c27309ccfbf1bb53d4e5/guides/source/active_record_migrations.md?plain=1#L606C6-L606C6)**. Therefore, it looks to me like the cause of the confusion is that when the section was updated to remove the `create_table` call, it caused the last bit of the wording in that section to become nonsensical.\r\n\r\nI am not any kind of Rails expert, so I wouldn't want to try and edit the documentation myself, so I have decided to open this issue here.
