Here's a screenshot from when those marks were working:\n\n<img width=\"507\" height=\"334\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e8718a32-9d15-42c1-8bf4-2bb70b165dd6\" />\n\n(That example is the 3rd code block in [this section](https://edgeguides.rubyonrails.org/getting_started.html#showing-individual-products). When visiting that page at the time of writing, the blue marks are not working)\n\n_I apologise for just complaining about this in comments/issues rather than making a PR myself. But I don't have enough CSS knowledge to know what the one true fix is, that solves both the problems with unnecessary-scroll-bars and lack-of-blue-marks simultaneously._","closed_by":{"login":"rafaelfranca","id":47848,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3ODQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47848?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelfranca","html_url":"https://github.com/rafaelfranca","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelfranca/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelfranca/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelfranca/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelfranca/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelfranca/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelfranca/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelfranca/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelfranca/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelfranca/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/55946/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/55946/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
