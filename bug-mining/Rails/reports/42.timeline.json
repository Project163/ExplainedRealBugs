think that the issue is, that according to [RFC 2045 5.1.](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2045#section-5.1) the value can be either a token (like `MIME_NAME`) or a quoted string. In [RFC 822 3.3](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc822#section-3.3) a quoted string can contain everything, including characters that are escaped with `\\`.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure if we need to be as relaxed as this definition. Potentially `(#{MIME_NAME}|\"[^\"\\r\\\\]*\")` might suffice.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, whilst looking into this I've detected that the current implementation of `PARAMETER_SEPARATOR_REGEXP` does not work as intended. https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/48e4d99c75b7fded3d54c42883e49eddac879b39/actionpack/lib/action_dispatch/http/mime_type.rb#L155\r\n\r\nTo get the q-value, `split` is used with this

Motivation / Background\r\n\r\nThis Pull Request has been created because `Mime::Type` does not correctly handle quoted parameters. They can contain most characters, including a comma. Additionally, the current implementation ignored the parameters when loading the type, but not when registering it.\r\n\r\nFixes #48052\r\n\r\n### Detail\r\n\r\nThis Pull Request changes `Mime::Type` to allow every character in a quoted parameter value, except `\\r`, `\\` and `\"` as defined in [RFC 822 3.3](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc822#section-3.3), except for escaped characters (see Current Limitations).\r\n\r\nAdditionally, the different parts of the Accept header are not simply split by `,`, but now factor in quotes.\r\n\r\nIn the current implementation `Mime::Type.register` kept the parameters, whereas `Mime::Type.parse` removed them. This PR now keeps all parameters before the `q` parameter (as defined in [RFC 7231 5.3.2](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7231#section-5.3.2)). If during the lookup no type with the parameter could be found, a type is searched for without parameters as a fallback. This is useful for example for `multipart/form-data; boundary=\"simple boundary\"` and keeps the current behaviour.\r\n\r\n### Current Limitations\r\n\r\nCurrently the following limitations exist, but I'm not sure if they are worth the effort:\r\n\r\n* Quoted strings could contain escaped characters, including `\\\"`. My implementation does not allow a backslash to simplify the parsing and keeping it efficient.\r\n* If there are whitespace-differences around the parameters they would not be considered as matching. E.g. `my/type;test=\"value\"` would not match `my/type; test=\"value\"`\r\n* According to [RFC 7231 5.3.2](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7231#section-5.3.2), the types with parameters have precedence over types without parameters. But sorting them according to this information would mean to split the types from the parameters, which introduces additional computational effort.\r\n\r\n### Checklist\r\n\r\nBefore submitting the PR make sure the following are checked:\r\n\r\n* [x] This Pull Request is related to one change. Changes that are unrelated should be opened in separate PRs.\r\n* [x] Commit message has a detailed description of what changed and why. If this PR fixes a related issue include it in the commit message. Ex: `[Fix #issue-number]`\r\n* [x] Tests are added or updated if you fix a bug or add a feature.\r\n* [x] CHANGELOG files are updated for the changed libraries if there is a behavior change or additional feature. Minor bug fixes and documentation changes should not be included.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/48397/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":1,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/48397/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":9436067369,"node_id":"CE_lADNIULOZDhrDs8AAAACMm72KQ","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/events/9436067369","actor":{"login":"rafaelfranca","id":47848,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3ODQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47848?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelfranca","html_url":"https://github.com/rafaelfranca","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelfranca/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelfranca/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelfranca/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelfranca/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelfranca/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelfranca/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelfranca/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelfranca/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelfranca/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2023-06-05T16:56:19Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
