As someone who fell victim to this, thank you so much for logging the issue here! We upgraded our Rails application from 7.1.4 -> 7.2 and our AWS SDK exploded because of a missing region which, without modification, works fine in Rails 7.1.4. Otherwise our Rails 7.2 upgrade went as smooth as can be.\r\n\r\nThe specific error is the exact same as mentioned in [this article](https://blog.driftingruby.com/rails-7-2-upgrade-problems-of-my-own-making/): \r\n\r\n```bash\r\n** Invoke vite:build_all (first_time)\r\n** Invoke vite:verify_install (first_time)\r\n** Invoke environment (first_time)\r\n** Execute environment\r\nError retrieving instance profile credentials: Aws::InstanceProfileCredentials::TokenRetrivalError\r\nbin/rails aborted!\r\nAws::Errors::MissingRegionError: No region was provided. Configure the `:region` option or export the region name to ENV['AWS_REGION'] (Aws::Errors::MissingRegionError)\r\n\r\n        raise Errors::MissingRegionError if region.nil? || region == ''\r\n

region and bucket name from our environment.\r\n\r\nIt took us a while to find this issue, but I do still have one question if anyone else finds themselves here: **Where in the 7.2 upgrade is the change which may have caused these ENV variables to return `nil` during the assets:precompile phase?**\r\n\r\nAny guidance would be
