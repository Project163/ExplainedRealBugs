Getting Started guide:\r\n\r\n1. The `blog#show` route example spuriously appears twice, with the [second occurrence](https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/cfc6c5656f10452f354cd5bd28dd4ae020834a40/guides/source/getting_started.md?plain=1#L776-L779) seemingly a vestigial copy-paste error not referenced in the text.\r\n2. The \"CRUD Routes\" subsection says \"This translates to 7 typical routes\" but then shows 8 routes. There are indeed 7 *controller methods*, but it seems like a quick mention of the distinction between `patch` and `put` would be appropriate and avoid confusion here. (Indeed, as an experienced but new-to-Rails programmer, I noticed because I was curious to know!)","closed_by":{"login":"rafaelfranca","id":47848,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3ODQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47848?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelfranca","html_url":"https://github.com/rafaelfranca","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelfranca/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelfranca/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelfranca/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelfranca/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelfranca/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelfranca/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelfranca/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelfranca/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelfranca/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/54009/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/54009/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
