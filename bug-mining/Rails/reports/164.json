I've attached a minimal version here.\r\n\r\n1. Import the [attached SQL file](https://github.com/rails/rails/files/11139214/structure.sql.zip) into your test database (you'll need to unzip it first, GitHub doesn't allow SQL files to be attached).\r\n\r\n```sql\r\nDROP TABLE IF EXISTS `sample_table`;\r\nCREATE TABLE `sample_table` (\r\n                                `id` int NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,\r\n                                `test_column` json DEFAULT NULL,\r\n                                PRIMARY KEY (`id`),\r\n                                CONSTRAINT `non_empty_test_array` CHECK (json_schema_valid(_utf8mb4'\\n        {\\n          \"oneOf\": [\\n            {\\n              \"type\": \"null\"\\n            },\\n            {\\n              \"type\": \"array\",\\n              \"minItems\": 1,\\n              \"items\": {\\n                \"type\": \"integer\",\\n                \"minimum\": 0\\n              }\\n            }\\n          ]\\n        }',`test_column`))\r\n) ENGINE=InnoDB DEFAULT CHARSET=utf8mb4 COLLATE=utf8mb4_0900_ai_ci;\r\n```\r\n\r\n2. Dump the database again with `bin/rails db:schema:dump`. You'll find that the output for the check_constraint looks like this:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nActiveRecord::Schema[7.1].define(version: 0) do\r\n  create_table \"sample_table\", id: :integer, charset: \"utf8mb4\", collation: \"utf8mb4_0900_ai_ci\", force: :cascade do |t|\r\n    t.json \"test_column\"\r\n    t.check_constraint \"son_schema_valid(_utf8mb4\\\\'\\\\\\\\n        {\\\\\\\\n          \\\"oneOf\\\": [\\\\\\\\n            {\\\\\\\\n              \\\"type\\\": \\\"null\\\"\\\\\\\\n            },\\\\\\\\n            {\\\\\\\\n              \\\"type\\\": \\\"array\\\",\\\\\\\\n              \\\"minItems\\\": 1,\\\\\\\\n              \\\"items\\\": {\\\\\\\\n                \\\"type\\\": \\\"integer\\\",\\\\\\\\n                \\\"minimum\\\": 0\\\\\\\\n              }\\\\\\\\n            }\\\\\\\\n          ]\\\\\\\\n        }\\\\',`test_column`\", name: \"non_empty_test_array\"\r\n  end\r\n\r\nend\r\n```\r\n\r\n3. If you try to import this back into a clean database now, with `bin/rails db:drop db:create db:schema:load`, it will fail:\r\n\r\n```\r\nbin/rails aborted!\r\nActiveRecord::StatementInvalid: Mysql2::Error: You have an error in your SQL syntax; check the manual that corresponds to your MySQL server version for the right syntax to use near '\\'\\\\n        {\\\\n          \"oneOf\": [\\\\n            {\\\\n              \"type\": \"n' at line 1\r\n/repro/db/schema.rb:14:in `block in <main>'\r\n/repro/db/schema.rb:13:in `<main>'\r\n\r\nCaused by:\r\nMysql2::Error: You have an error in your SQL syntax; check the manual that corresponds to your MySQL server version for the right syntax to use near '\\'\\\\n        {\\\\n          \"oneOf\": [\\\\n            {\\\\n              \"type\": \"n' at line 1\r\n```\r\n\r\n4. You'll note that we also have weird escape characters in the constraint; these were present in the original SQL for the constraint but should probably also be stripped out.\r\n\r\n<!-- Paste your executable test case created from one of the scripts found [here](https://edgeguides.rubyonrails.org/contributing_to_ruby_on_rails.html#create-an-executable-test-case) below: -->\r\n\r\nI couldn't get a reliably working reproduction script because I couldn't find any documentation on loading Rake tasks in for minimal scripts.\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\n<!-- Tell us what should happen -->\r\n\r\nWhen running the `db:schema:dump` task, we should expect that any tables with check constraints are dumped such that they can be imported with `db:schema:load`.\r\n\r\n### Actual behavior\r\n<!-- Tell us what happens instead -->\r\n\r\nThe first and last characters of the check constraint are stripped by the SchemaDumper.
