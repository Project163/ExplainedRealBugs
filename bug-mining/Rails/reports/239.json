I expect I will get an error.\n\n### Actual behavior\n\nIt boots with no problem and no clear warning:\n\n```\n$ RAILS_ENV=stage rails server\n=> Booting Puma\n=> Rails 8.0.3 application starting in stage\n=> Run `bin/rails server --help` for more startup options\nconfig.eager_load is set to nil. Please update your config/environments/*.rb files accordingly:\n\n  * development - set it to false\n  * test - set it to false (unless you use a tool that preloads your test environment)\n  * production - set it to true\n\nPuma starting in single mode...\n* Puma version: 7.0.4 (\"Romantic Warrior\")\n* Ruby version: ruby 3.4.6 (2025-09-16 revision dbd83256b1) +YJIT +PRISM [arm64-darwin24]\n*  Min threads: 3\n*  Max threads: 3\n*  Environment: stage\n*          PID: 86318\n* Listening on http://0.0.0.0:3000\nUse Ctrl-C to stop\n```\n\n## Suggestion\n\n> WARNING: You are using `RAILS_ENV=stage`, but no `config/environments/stage.rb` was found. Known environments:\n>\n> - test.rb\n> - production.rb\n> - development.rb\n>\n> If this is intentional, you can ignore this warning by setting `RAILS_IGNORE_MISSING_ENV=stage`\n\nRelated: We could also have `Rails.env.<environment>?`, also check for the existence of a specific file for proof that it's a valid environment. Otherwise, `Rails.env.staaging?` has the same problem (silent typo failure, hard to find).\n\n### System configuration\n\n**Rails version**: 8.0.3\n\n**Ruby version**: 3.4.6\n","closed_by":{"login":"byroot","id":44640,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0NjQw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/44640?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/byroot","html_url":"https://github.com/byroot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/byroot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/byroot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/byroot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/byroot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/byroot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/byroot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/byroot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/byroot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/byroot/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/55779/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/55779/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
