Motivation / Background\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes https://github.com/rails/rails/issues/47535, adding support for multiple cookies in the cookie jar.\r\n\r\n### Detail\r\n\r\nCurrently the `flag_cookies_as_secure!` assumes `cookies` parsed from the \"Set-Cookie\" header to be a string, but it can indeed be an array. This PR adds a check to confirm `cookies` is a string before splitting it.\r\n\r\n### Checklist\r\n\r\nBefore submitting the PR make sure the following are checked:\r\n\r\n* [x] This Pull Request is related to one change. Changes that are unrelated should be opened in separate PRs.\r\n* [x] Commit message has a detailed description of what changed and why. If this PR fixes a related issue include it in the commit message. Ex: `[Fix #issue-number]`\r\n* [x] Tests are added or updated if you fix a bug or add a feature.\r\n* [ ] CHANGELOG files are updated for the changed libraries if there is a behavior change or additional feature. Minor bug fixes and documentation changes should not be included.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/47597/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/47597/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":8698804958,"node_id":"REFE_lADNIULOX5GEgs8AAAACBn063g","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/events/8698804958","actor":{"login":"ron-shinall","id":81988008,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxOTg4MDA4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/81988008?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ron-shinall","html_url":"https://github.com/ron-shinall","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ron-shinall/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ron-shinall/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ron-shinall/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ron-shinall/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ron-shinall/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ron-shinall/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ron-shinall/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ron-shinall/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ron-shinall/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"45547e1ee7251b87b8e7097cdf78ea5a7fde1815","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/higher-pixels/rails/commits/45547e1ee7251b87b8e7097cdf78ea5a7fde1815","created_at":"2023-03-08T17:29:47Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":8734746663,"node_id":"CE_lADNIULOX5GEgs8AAAACCKGoJw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/events/8734746663","actor":{"login":"rafaelfranca","id":47848,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3ODQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47848?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelfranca","html_url":"https://github.com/rafaelfranca","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelfranca/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelfranca/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelfranca/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelfranca/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelfranca/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelfranca/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelfranca/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelfranca/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelfranca/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2023-03-13T17:54:11Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
