Runs in all validation contexts by default nil. You can pass a symbol or an array of symbols. (e.g. on: :create or on: :custom_validation_context or on: [:create, :custom_validation_context])\r\n\r\nThis option should be respected when validating the associated object.\r\n\r\n### Actual behavior\r\nThe default context is used and a custom context is not respected. In the above test this means the association is considered valid when it should not.\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n**Rails version**: 7.0.4\r\n\r\n**Ruby version**: 3.1.1\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"rafaelfranca","id":47848,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3ODQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47848?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelfranca","html_url":"https://github.com/rafaelfranca","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelfranca/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelfranca/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelfranca/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelfranca/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelfranca/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelfranca/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelfranca/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelfranca/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelfranca/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/46239/reactions","total_count":4,"+1":4,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/46239/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
