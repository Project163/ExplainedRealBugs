been debugging [this Solid Cache issue](https://github.com/rails/solid_cache/issues/238), and it looks like it is caused by reloading the connection class.\n\nIt is [stored](https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/31f8a6b6cce5e38f1f8a9532d441c4d19ca8fb08/activerecord/lib/active_record/connection_adapters/pool_config.rb#L32) in the `ActiveRecord::ConnectionAdapters::PoolConfig`, and if the connection class is reloaded, then \nit no longer matches the stored value.\n\nThis breaks checks like [this](https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/31f8a6b6cce5e38f1f8a9532d441c4d19ca8fb08/activerecord/lib/active_record/core.rb#L198), leading to issues like the one we see in the Solid Cache bug.\n\nYou can reproduce in a development console if you are using Solid Cache like this:\n\n```ruby\n>> ActiveRecord::Base.connected_to(role: ActiveRecord.reading_role, prevent_writes: true) do \n  SolidCache::Record.connected_to(shard: :cache, role: :writing, prevent_writes: false) do\n     puts SolidCache::Record.connection.preventing_writes?\n  end\nend\nfalse\n=> nil\n>> reload!\nReloading...\n>> ActiveRecord::Base.connected_to(role: ActiveRecord.reading_role, prevent_writes: true) do \n  SolidCache::Record.connected_to(shard: :cache, role: :writing, prevent_writes: false) do\n     puts SolidCache::Record.connection.preventing_writes?\n  end\nend\ntrue\n=> nil\n>>\n```\n\nI can fix this specifically for Solid Cache by preventing `SolidCache::Record` from being reloaded, but this could still be an issue for any application specific connection classes.","closed_by":{"login":"byroot","id":44640,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0NjQw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/44640?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/byroot","html_url":"https://github.com/byroot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/byroot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/byroot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/byroot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/byroot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/byroot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/byroot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/byroot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/byroot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/byroot/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/54343/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/54343/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
