work requires total isolation of our GH accounts so I can't put up a PR for this right now / am not sure when I will have the bandwidth to do so, but if anyone wants an easy win:\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\n<!-- (Guidelines for creating a bug report are [available\r\nhere](https://edgeguides.rubyonrails.org/contributing_to_ruby_on_rails.html#creating-a-bug-report)) -->\r\n[ActionMailer::Base#mail](https://api.rubyonrails.org/v7.0/classes/ActionMailer/Base.html#method-i-mail) accepts a `:date` header argument, but the [rails mailers email template doesn't check the date header and always renders Time.current.rfc2822](https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/ea4c48ad3979c8f6688339c62a4a9c3aea9f9a68/railties/lib/rails/templates/rails/mailers/email.html.erb#L96)\r\n\r\n<!-- Paste your executable test case created from one of the scripts found [here](https://edgeguides.rubyonrails.org/contributing_to_ruby_on_rails.html#create-an-executable-test-case) below: -->\r\n```ruby\r\nclass MyMailerPreview < ActionMailer::Preview\r\n  def preview\r\n    mail = MailKlass.find(params[:id])\r\n\r\n    MyMailer.view_sent(mail)\r\n  end\r\nend\r\n\r\nclass MyMailer < ActionMailer::Base\r\n  def view_sent(email)\r\n    mail(\r\n      to: email.email,\r\n      subject: email.subject,\r\n      date: email.sent_at\r\n    ) do |format|\r\n      format.html { render email.template }\r\n    end\r\n  end\r\nend\r\n```\r\nMy use case is previewing an email that was already sent.\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\n<!-- Tell us what should happen -->\r\nActionMailer template header section should render the value of `@mail.header['date']` (from `mail(date: some_timestamp)`) if the header is present\r\n### Actual behavior\r\n<!-- Tell us what happens instead -->\r\nPreviewed emails always render the result of `Time.current.rfc2822` without checking for the presence of `@email.header['date']`\r\n\r\n### Solution\r\nReplace this\r\nhttps://github.com/rails/rails/blob/ea4c48ad3979c8f6688339c62a4a9c3aea9f9a68/railties/lib/rails/templates/rails/mailers/email.html.erb#L96\r\n\r\nwith this:\r\n```ruby\r\n    <dd id=\"date\"><%= @email.header['date'] || Time.current.rfc2822 %></dd>\r\n```\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n**Rails version**:\r\n7x\r\n**Ruby
