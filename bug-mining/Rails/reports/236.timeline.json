Motivation / Background\r\n\r\nThis Pull Request has been created because #54341 introduced a behavior change for `Enumerable#sole` when the sole element is a tuple.\r\n\r\nPreviously, `Enumerable#sole` would return the full tuple (same as `Enumerable#first`). #54341 changed the behavior so that `Enumerable#sole` only returns the first element of the tuple.\r\n\r\nFixes #55807.\r\n\r\n### Detail\r\n\r\nThis Pull Request changes `Enumerable#sole` to return the full tuple, i.e. the same value as `Enumerable#first`.\r\n\r\n### Additional information\r\n\r\n-\r\n\r\n### Checklist\r\n\r\nBefore submitting the PR make sure the following are checked:\r\n\r\n* [X] This Pull Request is related to one change. Unrelated changes should be opened in separate PRs.\r\n* [X] Commit message has a detailed description of what changed and why. If this PR fixes a related issue include it in the commit message. Ex: `[Fix #issue-number]`\r\n* [X] Tests are added or updated if you fix a bug or add a feature.\r\n* [X] CHANGELOG files are updated for the changed libraries if there is a behavior change or additional feature. Minor bug fixes and documentation changes should not be included.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/55808/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/55808/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":20015933313,"node_id":"REFE_lADNIULOztl8tM8AAAAEqQrngQ","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/events/20015933313","actor":{"login":"byroot","id":44640,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0NjQw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/44640?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/byroot","html_url":"https://github.com/byroot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/byroot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/byroot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/byroot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/byroot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/byroot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/byroot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/byroot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/byroot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/byroot/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"aa0aad654c5e64b059d2f00d8089f1665d64cb86","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/olivier-thatch/rails/commits/aa0aad654c5e64b059d2f00d8089f1665d64cb86","created_at":"2025-09-30T17:41:23Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":20016019632,"node_id":"REFE_lADNIULOztl8tM8AAAAEqQw4sA","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/events/20016019632","actor":{"login":"byroot","id":44640,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0NjQw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/44640?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/byroot","html_url":"https://github.com/byroot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/byroot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/byroot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/byroot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/byroot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/byroot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/byroot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/byroot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/byroot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/byroot/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"34cc80db62722803372b39486a1e1f767fb6c965","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/olivier-thatch/rails/commits/34cc80db62722803372b39486a1e1f767fb6c965","created_at":"2025-09-30T17:46:30Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":20016177602,"node_id":"CE_lADNIULOztl8tM8AAAAEqQ6hwg","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/events/20016177602","actor":{"login":"byroot","id":44640,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0NjQw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/44640?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/byroot","html_url":"https://github.com/byroot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/byroot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/byroot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/byroot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/byroot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/byroot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/byroot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/byroot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/byroot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/byroot/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2025-09-30T17:55:55Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
