Motivation / Background\r\n\r\nFixes https://github.com/rails/rails/issues/52829\r\n\r\nWhen we have a schema file, if we run `db:migrate` before setting up the db, we do not load the schema and then we blow away the contents of the file when we dump the schema after migrations.\r\n\r\nYou can repro by creating a fresh app and running the following commands:\r\n\r\n```\r\nbin/rails g model Post\r\nbin/rails db:migrate\r\nrm -rf db/migrate\r\nbin/rails db:drop\r\nbin/rails db:migrate\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter following these steps, the schema file will be empty and the posts table will not exist.\r\n\r\n### Detail\r\n\r\nWe should make sure the db is setup before we run migrations. This is what we do in the `db:prepare` task. So, I extracted the code from that task and reused it in the migration task.\r\n\r\n### Additional information\r\n\r\n<!-- Provide additional information such as benchmarks, references to other repositories, or alternative solutions. -->\r\n\r\n### Checklist\r\n\r\nBefore submitting the PR make sure the following are checked:\r\n\r\n* [x] This Pull Request is related to one change. Unrelated changes should be opened in separate PRs.\r\n* [x] Commit message has a detailed description of what changed and why. If this PR fixes a related issue include it in the commit message.

an existing app i'm updating to version 1.0.0 and it's sooo confusing.  I notice that you now recommend a separate database for queue tables.  This is fine but the documentation for updating doesn't make any sense.\r\n\r\nIt doesn't explain whether I need a separate data in development. It doesn't explain how to get that etc.\r\n\r\nI've set my DB config to be:\r\n\r\ndefault: &default\r\n  adapter: postgresql\r\n  encoding: unicode\r\n  pool: <%= ENV.fetch(\"RAILS_MAX_THREADS\") { 5 } %>\r\n  <% if ENV[\"DB_HOST\"] %>\r\n  host: <%= ENV[\"DB_HOST\"] %>\r\n  username: postgres\r\n  password: postgres\r\n  <% end %>\r\n\r\ndevelopment:\r\n  <<: *default\r\n  database: family_media_development\r\n\r\ntest:\r\n  <<: *default\r\n  database: family_media_test\r\n\r\nproduction:\r\n  primary: &primary_production\r\n    <<: *default\r\n    url: <%= ENV[\"DATABASE_URL\"] %>\r\n  queue:\r\n    <<: *primary_production\r\n    url: <%= ENV[\"QUEUE_DATABASE_URL\"] %>\r\n    migrations_paths: db/queue_migrate\r\n\r\nI've created a queue DB as configured above but when I run db:prepare it does nothing.  I've connected to the queue DB in TablePlus and it's empty.\r\n\r\nThe documentation makes absolutely no mention of what `migrations_paths: db/queue_migrate` does.  I don't have anything that exists in my app as db/queue_migrate.\r\n\r\nDo I have to make a separate DB in development too?   I'd like both to work in the same way.\r\n\r\nI'm very confused.    The app i've updated is now failing to deploy with the error:\r\n\r\n-----> Running Rails db:migrate\r\n-----> /home/deploy/.asdf/bin/asdf exec bundle exec rake db:migrate\r\nrake aborted!\r\nStandardError: An error has occurred, this and all later migrations canceled: (StandardError)\r\n\r\nPG::UndefinedTable: ERROR:  relation \"solid_queue_processes\" does not exist\r\nLINE 10:  WHERE a.attrelid = '\"solid_queue_processes\"'::regclass\r\n                             ^\r\n\r\n\r\nSorry for the two issues created today.

hope there is a better way to do this that I am not seeing.\r\n\r\nAccording to the read me:\r\n\r\n> Then run db:prepare in production to ensure the database is created and the schema is loaded.\r\n\r\nI am testing this out in staging first. So I ran the following on the server:\r\n```\r\nRAILS_ENV=staging bin/rails db:prepare\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis did nothing to the queue database. Maybe because the queue database already existed? Our deployment process sets up the databases ahead of time. So running this command resulted in zero tables in the queue DB. Plus, db:prepare is not listed as a command for multiple databases. However, db:setup is. So, I ran:\r\n```\r\nRAILS_ENV=staging bin/rails db:setup:queue\r\n```\r\nThis might have worked. However, it tried connecting to the postgres database. Presumably to drop and recreate the database. However, connecting as postgres is not allowed on our staging and production systems.\r\n\r\nSo, I tried db:schema:load:queue (I actually tried this first):\r\n```\r\nRAILS_ENV=staging bin/rails db:schema:load:queue\r\n```\r\nThis resulted in this error:\r\n```\r\nbin/rails aborted!\r\nTypeError: Invalid type for configuration. Expected Symbol, String, or Hash. Got nil (TypeError)\r\n        raise TypeError, \"Invalid type for configuration. Expected Symbol, String, or Hash. Got #{config.inspect}\"\r\n              ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\r\nTasks: TOP => db:schema:load:queue => db:test:purge:queue\r\n```\r\nIt looks like it is doing something with regard to a test DB that does not exist? There is actually an open PR about this: https://github.com/rails/rails/issues/50672.\r\n\r\nThen I started a console in the Staging environment on the server and ran these commands to load the schema in the queue database:\r\n```\r\nActiveRecord::Base.establish_connection(:queue)\r\nload Rails.root.join('db','queue_schema.rb')\r\n```\r\nThis successfully loaded the queue database.\r\n\r\nIs there a better way to do this? I don't remember having to load a schema in Staging or Production before. It seems like an anti-pattern? I started using Solid Queue with version 0.3 and the migrations sure seemed easier. Would it be easier to place the contents of the queue_schema.rb in a single migration file?\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/solid_queue/issues/365/reactions","total_count":20,"+1":20,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/solid_queue/issues/365/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/2442905654","html_url":"https://github.com/rails/rails/issues/52829#issuecomment-2442905654","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/52829","id":2442905654,"node_id":"IC_kwDNIULOkZvINg","user":{"login":"jherdman","id":3300,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzMDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3300?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jherdman","html_url":"https://github.com/jherdman","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jherdman/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jherdman/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jherdman/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jherdman/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jherdman/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jherdman/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jherdman/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jherdman/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jherdman/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-10-29T00:10:38Z","updated_at":"2024-10-29T00:10:38Z","body":"I came here via the noted solid queue issue above.
