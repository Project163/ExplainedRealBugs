https://github.com/rails/rails/issues/54148\r\n\r\nDirectory \"action_text-trix\" contains a gem that is a Rails engine providing Trix assets (js and css files).\r\n\r\nWhen cutting a release, there is a rake task \"sync\" provided by action_text-trix/Rakefile to copy Trix files from the build directory into the gem directory. See action_text-trix/README.md for more information.\r\n\r\nA note on naming: \"trix\" is already taken, as is \"trix-rails\", \"trix_rails\", \"trix_on_rails\", and \"trix-gem\". But also, this gem should really only ever be used as an implicit dependency of Rails and Action Text, so naming is less important than it otherwise might be.\r\n\r\nI've emailed the owner of \"trix\" to see if they would be willing to give up the name, but at this point I think I've decided it doesn't matter a whole lot.\r\n\r\nThe accompanying Rails PR will look something like this:
