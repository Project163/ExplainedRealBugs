#52530\r\n\r\n### Motivation / Background\r\n\r\nThis Pull Request addresses an issue where adding a merge with an `or` condition to a scope in ActiveRecord could unintentionally widen the scope if the scope contains raw SQL strings. The fix ensures that scopes behave as expected, returning only the records that match the intended query criteria.\r\n\r\n### Details\r\n\r\nThis Pull Request includes changes to the `merger.rb` file to properly handle the merging of scopes that involve raw SQL strings. Specifically, the logic was updated as follows:\r\n\r\n- **Conditional Check for Raw SQL**: \r\n  - Added a check to determine if either of the `where` clauses being merged contains raw SQL using the `raw_sql_involved?` method.\r\n- **Proper Handling of `or` Merging**: \r\n  - When raw SQL is involved, the merge is handled with the `merge_with_proper_or_handling` method, which ensures that the conditions are grouped correctly and the scope is not widened unintentionally.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/52550/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/52550/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/2277145991","html_url":"https://github.com/rails/rails/issues/52530#issuecomment-2277145991","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/52530","id":2277145991,"node_id":"IC_kwDNIULOh7p9hw","user":{"login":"Demon-Sheriff","id":142498048,"node_id":"U_kgDOCH5ZAA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/142498048?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Demon-Sheriff","html_url":"https://github.com/Demon-Sheriff","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Demon-Sheriff/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Demon-Sheriff/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Demon-Sheriff/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Demon-Sheriff/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Demon-Sheriff/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Demon-Sheriff/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Demon-Sheriff/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Demon-Sheriff/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Demon-Sheriff/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-08-09T04:48:28Z","updated_at":"2024-08-09T04:48:28Z","body":"> Feel free to work on it!

for contributing to Rails!\r\n\r\nPlease do not make *Draft* pull requests, as they still send\r\nnotifications to everyone watching the Rails repo.\r\n\r\nCreate a pull request when it is ready for review and feedback\r\nfrom the Rails team :).\r\n\r\nIf your pull request affects documentation or any non-code\r\nchanges, guidelines for those changes are [available\r\nhere](https://edgeguides.rubyonrails.org/contributing_to_ruby_on_rails.html#contributing-to-the-rails-documentation)\r\n\r\nAbout this template\r\n\r\nThe following template aims to help contributors write a good description for their pull requests.\r\nWe'd like you to provide a description of the changes in your pull request (i.e. bugs fixed or features added), the motivation behind the changes, and complete the checklist below before opening a pull request.\r\n\r\nFeel free to discard it if you need to (e.g. when you just fix a typo). -->\r\n\r\n### Motivation / Background\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nDescribe why this Pull Request needs to be merged. What bug have you fixed? What feature have you added? Why is it important?\r\nIf you are fixing a specific issue, include \"Fixes #ISSUE\" (replace with the issue number, remove the quotes) and the issue will be linked to this PR.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nFixes https://github.com/rails/rails/issues/52530\r\n\r\n### Detail\r\n\r\nCurrently, when extracting attributes from `Nary` (`And` or `Or`) children for a merge, if the first child yields a valid attribute and the second one doesn't yield anything ([like in the case of an `SqlLiteral`](https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/79df80b45873590f827fdd67b485fda4ad2f58b7/activerecord/lib/arel/nodes/sql_literal.rb#L22-L23)), [we stop iterating through the remaining nodes (`#all?`)](https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/79df80b45873590f827fdd67b485fda4ad2f58b7/activerecord/lib/arel/nodes/nary.rb#L22), and [return the attribute for the first child as the attribute for the entire node](https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/79df80b45873590f827fdd67b485fda4ad2f58b7/activerecord/lib/active_record/relation/where_clause.rb#L142).\r\n\r\nIn the case of the linked issue, this resulted in such attributes being excluded from the current where clause as it was considered to be conflicting with the where clause being merged in, resulting in an incorrect query.\r\n\r\nThis patch ensures that in such cases we also ensure that all nodes have yielded an attribute i.e. the return of `Arel.fetch_attribute` is truthy, similar to [how this is handled when excluding predicates](https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/79df80b45873590f827fdd67b485fda4ad2f58b7/activerecord/lib/active_record/relation/where_clause.rb#L181-L183).\r\n\r\nSeeing as this is the only node type where children are evaluated and that we already return early if the body of `Arel.fetch_attribute` is falsey, I used this as an opportunity to refactor that block so we don't need to explicitly return early when the attribute nodes are different.\r\n\r\n### Checklist\r\n\r\nBefore submitting the PR make sure the following are checked:\r\n\r\n* [x] This Pull Request is related to one change. Unrelated changes should be opened in separate PRs.\r\n* [x] Commit message has a detailed description of what changed and why. If this PR fixes a related issue include it in the commit message. Ex: `[Fix #issue-number]`\r\n* [x] Tests are added or updated if you fix a bug or add a feature.\r\n* [x] CHANGELOG files are updated for the changed libraries if there is a behavior change or additional feature. Minor bug fixes and documentation changes should not be included.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/54167/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/54167/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/2579926154","html_url":"https://github.com/rails/rails/issues/52530#issuecomment-2579926154","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/52530","id":2579926154,"node_id":"IC_kwDNIULOmcaMig","user":{"login":"joshuay03","id":54629302,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0NjI5MzAy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/54629302?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshuay03","html_url":"https://github.com/joshuay03","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshuay03/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshuay03/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshuay03/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshuay03/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshuay03/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshuay03/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshuay03/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshuay03/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshuay03/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-01-09T11:33:36Z","updated_at":"2025-01-09T11:33:36Z","body":"https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/54167","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/2579926154/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"joshuay03","id":54629302,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0NjI5MzAy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/54629302?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshuay03","html_url":"https://github.com/joshuay03","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshuay03/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshuay03/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshuay03/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshuay03/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshuay03/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshuay03/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshuay03/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshuay03/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshuay03/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":15874079400,"node_id":"REFE_lADNIULOkjteeM8AAAADsis6qA","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/events/15874079400","actor":{"login":"joshuay03","id":54629302,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0NjI5MzAy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/54629302?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshuay03","html_url":"https://github.com/joshuay03","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshuay03/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshuay03/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshuay03/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshuay03/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshuay03/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshuay03/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshuay03/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshuay03/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshuay03/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"791b97867fe95d6d3ffa411c6ce45e78633cfc6f","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/joshuay03/rails/commits/791b97867fe95d6d3ffa411c6ce45e78633cfc6f","created_at":"2025-01-09T22:00:43Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
