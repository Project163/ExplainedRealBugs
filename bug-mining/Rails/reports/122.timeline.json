#52089\r\n\r\nFrom what I understand, `path` is only set in the context of `eval`. When explicitly raising `SyntaxError`, `path` is `nil`.\r\n\r\nRegardless of how `SyntaxError` is raised, the \"path\" always exists in `SyntaxError#to_s`. Therefore, we should just use `#to_s`.\r\n\r\nHere is an example of the difference between `path` (when it's present) and `to_s` (the first line is `path`):\r\n\r\n```\r\n\"(eval at /Users/jko/Developer/rails/rails/actionpack/test/dispatch/debug_exceptions_test.rb:106)\"\r\n\"(eval at /Users/jko/Developer/rails/rails/actionpack/test/dispatch/debug_exceptions_test.rb:106):1: syntax error, unexpected end-of-input\\nbroke_syntax =\\n              ^\\n\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nI see no reason to use [the convenience method](https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/19138) `path` and it was [chosen because it's simpler](https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/48957#discussion_r1305358915). \r\n\r\nPerhaps `path` not being populated outside `eval` is a Ruby bug?\r\n\r\n### Checklist\r\n\r\nBefore submitting the PR make sure the following are checked:\r\n\r\n* [x] This Pull Request is related to one change. Unrelated changes should be opened in separate PRs.\r\n* [x] Commit message has a detailed description of what changed and why. If this PR fixes a related issue include it in the commit message. Ex: `[Fix #issue-number]`\r\n* [x] Tests are added or updated if you fix a bug or add a feature.\r\n* [x] CHANGELOG files are updated for the changed libraries if there is a behavior change or additional feature. Minor bug fixes and documentation changes should not be included.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/52099/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/52099/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":13136209552,"node_id":"CE_lADNIULOi-F3tc8AAAADDvqmkA","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/events/13136209552","actor":{"login":"rafaelfranca","id":47848,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3ODQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47848?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelfranca","html_url":"https://github.com/rafaelfranca","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelfranca/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelfranca/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelfranca/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelfranca/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelfranca/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelfranca/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelfranca/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelfranca/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelfranca/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2024-06-12T19:03:21Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":13206872159,"node_id":"REFE_lADNIULOi-F3tc8AAAADEzDgXw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/events/13206872159","actor":{"login":"justinko","id":14007,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MDA3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14007?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinko","html_url":"https://github.com/justinko","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinko/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinko/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinko/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinko/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinko/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinko/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinko/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinko/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinko/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"474961b6480a264761a0b6245ebce2345c752eeb","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/justinko/rails/commits/474961b6480a264761a0b6245ebce2345c752eeb","created_at":"2024-06-18T21:30:40Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":13206997792,"node_id":"REFE_lADNIULOi-F3tc8AAAADEzLLIA","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/events/13206997792","actor":{"login":"justinko","id":14007,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MDA3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14007?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinko","html_url":"https://github.com/justinko","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinko/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinko/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinko/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinko/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinko/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinko/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinko/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinko/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinko/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"4afb7249c4fa7f08ce81bb143c9882996e173ab9","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/justinko/rails/commits/4afb7249c4fa7f08ce81bb143c9882996e173ab9","created_at":"2024-06-18T21:37:33Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"actor":{"login":"justinko","id":14007,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MDA3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14007?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinko","html_url":"https://github.com/justinko","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinko/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinko/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinko/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinko/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinko/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinko/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinko/repos","events_url":"http

#52081\r\n\r\nThis fixes a situation where a join table is missing in the SQL statement for a has/through relationship that utilizes a scope. It can occur when using `joins` in the scope with no where clauses (e.g. `joins(:post).where(posts: {name: \"foo\"})` vs `joins(:post).merge(Post.foo)`). The \"chain\" is cutoff and the join is left behind.\r\n\r\nI'm guessing this bug has lingered because the majority of `joins` also utilize/chain a `where`.\r\n\r\n### Checklist\r\n\r\nBefore submitting the PR make sure the following are checked:\r\n\r\n* [x] This Pull Request is related to one change.
