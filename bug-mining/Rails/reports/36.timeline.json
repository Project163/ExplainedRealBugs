for contributing to Rails!\r\n\r\nPlease do not make *Draft* pull requests, as they still send\r\nnotifications to everyone watching the Rails repo.\r\n\r\nCreate a pull request when it is ready for review and feedback\r\nfrom the Rails team :).\r\n\r\nIf your pull request affects documentation or any non-code\r\nchanges, guidelines for those changes are [available\r\nhere](https://edgeguides.rubyonrails.org/contributing_to_ruby_on_rails.html#contributing-to-the-rails-documentation)\r\n\r\nAbout this template\r\n\r\nThe following template aims to help contributors write a good description for their pull requests.\r\nWe'd like you to provide a description of the changes in your pull request (i.e. bugs fixed or features added), motivation behind the changes, and complete the checklist below before opening a pull request.\r\n\r\nFeel free to discard it if you need to (e.g. when you just fix a typo). -->\r\n\r\n### Motivation / Background\r\n\r\n`ActiveRecord::PredicateBuilder` currently assumes that a column name will only be specified in dot notation with a single period. If a column is specified in dot notation for a table that is namespaced in a schema, it will use the schema name as the table name. This PR allows columns to specified in the format `schema.table.column` as well as `table.column`.\r\n\r\nThis fixes #48172\r\n\r\n### Detail\r\n\r\nThis Pull Request changes the behavior of `ActiveRecord::PredicateBuilder.references` and `ActiveRecord::PredicateBuilder#convert_dot_notation_to_hash`\r\n\r\nI didn't add this to the CHANGELOG, but if a reviewer thinks it's significant enough I'm happy to do so.\r\n\r\n### Checklist\r\n\r\nBefore submitting the PR make sure the following are checked:\r\n\r\n* [x] This Pull Request is related to one change. Changes that are unrelated should be opened in separate PRs.\r\n* [x] Commit message has a detailed description of what changed and why. If this PR fixes a related issue include it in the commit message. Ex: `[Fix #issue-number]`\r\n* [x] Tests are added or updated if you fix a bug or add a feature.\r\n* [x] CHANGELOG files are updated for the changed libraries if there is a behavior change or additional feature. Minor bug fixes and documentation changes should not be included.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/48171/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/48171/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":9195081090,"node_id":"REFE_lADNIULOZWPKD88AAAACJBHNgg","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/events/9195081090","actor":{"login":"sholden","id":8165,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxNjU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8165?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sholden","html_url":"https://github.com/sholden","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sholden/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sholden/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sholden/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sholden/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sholden/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sholden/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sholden/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sholden/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sholden/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"904e3081bbdca2853227a5f42ee3c805b08052a5","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sholden/rails/commits/904e3081bbdca2853227a5f42ee3c805b08052a5","created_at":"2023-05-08T22:50:21Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":9195098358,"node_id":"REFE_lADNIULOZWPKD88AAAACJBIQ9g","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/events/9195098358","actor":{"login":"sholden","id":8165,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxNjU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8165?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sholden","html_url":"https://github.com/sholden","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sholden/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sholden/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sholden/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sholden/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sholden/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sholden/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sholden/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sholden/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sholden/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"0fbcb5195bd0fa7a87bb2c977939cf50ade4fecb","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sholden/rails/commits/0fbcb5195bd0fa7a87bb2c977939cf50ade4fecb","created_at":"2023-05-08T22:55:16Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":9195450366,"node_id":"LE_lADNIULOZWPKD88AAAACJBdv_g","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/events/9195450366","actor":{"login":"yahonda","id":73684,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjczNjg0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/73684?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yahonda","html_url":"https://github.com/yahonda","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yahonda/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yahonda/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yahonda/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yahonda/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yahonda/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yahonda/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yahonda/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yahonda/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yahonda/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2023-05-09T00:24:37Z","label":{"name":"activerecord","color":"0b02e1"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":9195450370,"node_id":"LE_lADNIULOZWPKD88AAAACJBdwAg","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/events/9195450370","actor":{"login":"yahonda","id":73684,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjczNjg0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/73684?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yahonda","html_url":"https://github.com/yahonda","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yahonda/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yahonda/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yahonda/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yahonda/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yahonda/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yahonda/orgs","repos_url":"https:
