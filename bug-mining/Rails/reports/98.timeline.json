Changes that are unrelated should be opened in separate PRs.\r\n* [x] Commit message has a detailed description of what changed and why. If this PR fixes a related issue include it in the commit message. Ex: `[Fix #issue-number]`\r\n* [x] Tests are added or updated if you fix a bug or add a feature.\r\n* [x] CHANGELOG files are updated for the changed libraries if there is a behavior change or additional feature. Minor bug fixes and documentation changes should not be included.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/50804/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/50804/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":11535265537,"node_id":"REFE_lADNIULOfJRqkM8AAAACr44vAQ","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/events/11535265537","actor":{"login":"joshuay03","id":54629302,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0NjI5MzAy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/54629302?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshuay03","html_url":"https://github.com/joshuay03","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshuay03/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshuay03/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshuay03/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshuay03/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshuay03/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshuay03/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshuay03/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshuay03/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshuay03/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"78114561ade0b0e891075ee58993c019421914ee","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/joshuay03/rails/commits/78114561ade0b0e891075ee58993c019421914ee","created_at":"2024-01-19T09:49:33Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":11535273814,"node_id":"REFE_lADNIULOfJRqkM8AAAACr45PVg","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/events/11535273814","actor":{"login":"joshuay03","id":54629302,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0NjI5MzAy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/54629302?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshuay03","html_url":"https://github.com/joshuay03","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshuay03/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshuay03/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshuay03/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshuay03/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshuay03/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshuay03/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshuay03/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshuay03/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshuay03/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"1cb4855aa1f76e0c1682bc071a286784c10accb9","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/joshuay03/rails/commits/1cb4855aa1f76e0c1682bc071a286784c10accb9","created_at":"2024-01-19T09:50:20Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/1900087461","html_url":"https://github.com/rails/rails/issues/50803#issuecomment-1900087461","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/50803","id":1900087461,"node_id":"IC_kwDNIULOcUEIpQ","user":{"login":"joshuay03","id":54629302,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0NjI5MzAy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/54629302?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshuay03","html_url":"https://github.com/joshuay03","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshuay03/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshuay03/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshuay03/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshuay03/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshuay03/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshuay03/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshuay03/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshuay03/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshuay03/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-01-19T09:51:55Z","updated_at":"2024-01-19T09:51:55Z","body":"Addressing
