Motivation / Background\r\n\r\nCloses #49818\r\n\r\n### Detail\r\n\r\nRenames `ActionView::TestCase::Behavior::Content` to\r\n`RenderedViewContent`, with the goal of making it more of an internal\r\nimplementation detail that's unlikely to collide with an\r\napplication-side `::Content` class.\r\n\r\nThe `RenderedView`-prefix mirrors the module's `RenderedViewsCollection`\r\nclass. Since the intention is to treat it as a private implementation\r\ndetail, `RenderedViewContent` is marked with `:nodoc:`.\r\n\r\nAlong with the rename, this commit also modifies the class inheritance,\r\nreplacing the `SimpleDelegator` superclass with `String`. [String.new][]\r\naccepts a `String` positional argument in the same way as\r\n`SimpleDelegator.new` accepts a delegate object positional argument.\r\nSharing the `String` superclass also makes it a good candidate for being\r\npassed to [Capybara.string][] (and [Capybara::Node::Simple.new][]) like\r\nthe documentation suggests.\r\n\r\n[Capybara.string]: https://github.com/teamcapybara/capybara/blob/3.39.2/lib/capybara.rb#L212-L242\r\n[Capybara::Node::Simple.new]: https://github.com/teamcapybara/capybara/blob/3.39.2/lib/capybara/node/simple.rb#L23\r\n[String.new]: https://ruby-doc.org/core/String.html#method-c-new\r\n\r\n### Additional information\r\n\r\nIs this worth backporting into a `7.1` release?\r\n\r\n### Checklist\r\n\r\nBefore submitting the PR make sure the following are checked:\r\n\r\n* [x] This Pull Request is related to one change. Changes that are unrelated should be opened in separate PRs.\r\n* [x] Commit message has a detailed description of what changed and why. If this PR fixes a related issue include it in the commit message. Ex: `[Fix #issue-number]`\r\n* [x] Tests are added or updated if you fix a bug or add a feature.\r\n* [x] CHANGELOG files are updated for the changed libraries if there is a behavior change or additional feature. Minor bug fixes and documentation changes should not be included.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/49856/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/49856/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/1786114210","html_url":"https://github.com/rails/rails/issues/49818#issuecomment-1786114210","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/49818","id":1786114210,"node_id":"IC_kwDNIULOanXwog","user":{"login":"seanpdoyle","id":2575027,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1NzUwMjc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2575027?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanpdoyle","html_url":"https://github.com/seanpdoyle","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanpdoyle/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanpdoyle/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanpdoyle/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanpdoyle/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanpdoyle/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanpdoyle/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanpdoyle/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanpdoyle/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanpdoyle/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-10-30T22:00:46Z","updated_at":"2023-10-30T22:00:46Z","body":"@p8 I like that!
