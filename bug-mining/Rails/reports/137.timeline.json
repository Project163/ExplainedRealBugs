you install Solid Queue, we add a new dedicated schema in db/queue_schema.rb. We also add an empty directory for future migrations in db/queue_migrate. If you run db:prepare, everything works as it should, after we fixed https://github.com/rails/rails/issues/52776. But if you run db:migrate, you get a different version of the same issue. The db/queue_schema.rb is erroneously overwritten with an empty schema. \r\n\r\nMaybe because the queue schema wasn't loaded yet when db:migrate tried to set up the secondary db upon running db:migrate, it may just be creating the empty db, then dumping the schema for that empty db (which is empty). This is not how it works on the primary DB nor of course is how it should work.\r\n\r\nIf on a new app, you have a db/schema.rb and you have an empty db/migrate, you won't get your schema zeroed out when running db:migrate as the first db task.\r\n\r\nSee https://github.com/rails/solid_queue/issues/329\r\n\r\ncc @rafaelfranca \r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/52829/reactions","total_count":4,"+1":4,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/52829/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":14510792730,"node_id":"REFE_lADNIULOlRl7AM8AAAADYOkgGg","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/events/14510792730","actor":{"login":"DanielaVelasquez","id":15008564,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MDA4NTY0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15008564?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/DanielaVelasquez","html_url":"https://github.com/DanielaVelasquez","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DanielaVelasquez/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DanielaVelasquez/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DanielaVelasquez/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DanielaVelasquez/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DanielaVelasquez/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DanielaVelasquez/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DanielaVelasquez/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DanielaVelasquez/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DanielaVelasquez/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"38f5621594afbe03a80f1939ef75a757badbdabb","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DanielaVelasquez/rails/commits/38f5621594afbe03a80f1939ef75a757badbdabb","created_at":"2024-10-03T21:58:56Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
