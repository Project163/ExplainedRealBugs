for the response. I'm still a bit unclear on the rationale behind this change; looking at the reported behaviour in #45668 , it seems to me that we have the same behaviour with other types, not just enums, so not sure where the difference is. \r\nEg if the column is a simple integer and we define `attribute :wrong_attributee` on Post model, we still will not throw on `new_post = Post.create!(wrong_attributee:  2) # column is not in the schema cache, so why no error?` and the Post will not be created with wrong_attributee = 2, just like in the code reported re: enum. (Happy to post a full test example if useful)\r\n\r\nEither way though, I guess it boils down to the statement \r\n\r\n> While it is possible to have attributes without the columns (defined with the [attribute](https://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActiveRecord/Attributes/ClassMethods.html#method-i-attribute) method), the enum (which is also defined by attribute) should always have a corresponding column.\r\n\r\nPerhaps we just need some documentation/explanation of this?","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/1774360470/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"ejskipper","id":40039308,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwMDM5MzA4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/40039308?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ejskipper","html_url":"https://github.com/ejskipper","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ejskipper/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ejskipper/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ejskipper/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ejskipper/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ejskipper/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ejskipper/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ejskipper/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ejskipper/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ejskipper/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/1775013774","html_url":"https://github.com/rails/rails/issues/49717#issuecomment-1775013774","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/49717","id":1775013774,"node_id":"IC_kwDNIULOacyPjg","user":{"login":"jkwuc89","id":1555064,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1NTUwNjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1555064?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkwuc89","html_url":"https://github.com/jkwuc89","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkwuc89/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkwuc89/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkwuc89/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkwuc89/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkwuc89/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkwuc89/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkwuc89/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkwuc89/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkwuc89/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-10-23T11:44:32Z","updated_at":"2023-10-23T11:44:32Z","body":"I also have a project that is being significantly impacted by this.

this.\r\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/1777673783/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"jonathanhefner","id":771968,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc3MTk2OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/771968?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonathanhefner","html_url":"https://github.com/jonathanhefner","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonathanhefner/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonathanhefner/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonathanhefner/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonathanhefner/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonathanhefner/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonathanhefner/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonathanhefner/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonathanhefner/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonathanhefner/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/1777978777","html_url":"https://github.com/rails/rails/issues/49717#issuecomment-1777978777","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/49717","id":1777978777,"node_id":"IC_kwDNIULOafnNmQ","user":{"login":"p8","id":28561,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4NTYx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/28561?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/p8","html_url":"https://github.com/p8","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/p8/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/p8/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/p8/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/p8/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/p8/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/p8/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/p8/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/p8/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/p8/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-10-24T20:23:08Z","updated_at":"2023-10-24T20:23:08Z","body":"@jonathanhefner
