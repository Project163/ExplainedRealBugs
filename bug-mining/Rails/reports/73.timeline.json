This discrepancy was [reported][] to the FFmpeg mailing list, and the [reply][] indicated that the change is intentional.\r\n\r\nFor this test, the exact duration isn't significant.  We merely want to assert that the metadata includes the duration reported by FFmpeg. Therefore, this commit changes the assertion to accomodate the duration reported by FFmpeg 6.0 as well as previous versions.\r\n\r\nFixes #49650.\r\n\r\n[reported]: https://ffmpeg.org/pipermail/ffmpeg-user/2023-October/057067.html\r\n[reply]: http://ffmpeg.org/pipermail/ffmpeg-user/2023-October/057083.html\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/49869/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":1,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/49869/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/1787614399","html_url":"https://github.com/rails/rails/issues/49650#issuecomment-1787614399","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/49650","id":1787614399,"node_id":"IC_kwDNIULOaozUvw","user":{"login":"jonathanhefner","id":771968,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc3MTk2OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/771968?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonathanhefner","html_url":"https://github.com/jonathanhefner","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonathanhefner/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonathanhefner/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonathanhefner/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonathanhefner/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonathanhefner/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonathanhefner/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonathanhefner/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonathanhefner/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonathanhefner/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-10-31T16:56:40Z","updated_at":"2023-10-31T16:56:40Z","body":"The purpose of a197d39e13ea2a52af19fb8c61274e67c2291be7 was to support duration metadata for video formats such as WebM, which store duration in the container rather than the video stream.  The [test for that](https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/a197d39e13ea2a52af19fb8c61274e67c2291be7/activestorage/test/analyzer/video_analyzer_test.rb#L48-L55) still appears to be correct.\r\n\r\nThat change also happened to provide duration metadata for video files that didn't have a video stream (i.e. audio only), which is why a197d39e13ea2a52af19fb8c61274e67c2291be7 had to modify `assert_equal(assert_equal({ \"analyzed\" => true, \"identified\" => true }, metadata)`.  But the specific duration 1.022000 is not important.  We just want to assert that we return the correct duration from FFmpeg.  If FFmpeg now claims the correct duration is 1.000000, then it is okay.\r\n\r\nSo I have submitted #49869 to support the duration reported by FFmpeg 6.0 as well as previous versions.  @yahonda, I have added you as a co-author since you spent time investigating this.  Thank you!
