Pass a custom encryptor (or other context properties) to the `encrypts` helper, e.g.\r\nhttps://github.com/rails/rails/blob/e6d59cdebbd0ddaf88029a7b9f03f5d642780e0a/activerecord/test/cases/encryption/encryption_schemes_test.rb#L198-L202\r\n1. Create a record and test a supposedly encrypted attribute with `encrypted_attribute?`:\r\n\r\n    ```ruby\r\n    author = EncryptedAuthor1.create name: \"1\"\r\n    assert author.encrypted_attribute? :name\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\n\r\nThe attribute is expected to be encrypted, i.e. `encrypted_attribute?` should return `true`.\r\n\r\n### Actual behavior\r\n\r\nThe attribute appears to be unencrypted, i.e. `encrypted_attribute?` returns `false`, despite the actual value being encrypted.\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\n**Rails version**: 7.1.2 / main\r\n**Ruby version**: 3.2.2\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"eileencodes","id":1080678,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwODA2Nzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1080678?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/eileencodes","html_url":"https://github.com/eileencodes","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eileencodes/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eileencodes/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eileencodes/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eileencodes/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eileencodes/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eileencodes/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eileencodes/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eileencodes/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eileencodes/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/48922/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/48922/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
