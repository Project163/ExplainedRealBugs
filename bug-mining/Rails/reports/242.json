Why do you think controller action method names can't start with \"\\_\" ? \n\nWhy do you decide what names are allowed and what aren't? For example, **I use underscores specifically for \"inner\" actions in a controller**.\n\nIn ActionPack:\nactionpack (8.1.0) lib/abstract_controller/base.rb:100:in 'AbstractController::Base#action_methods :\n```ruby\n      def action_methods\n        @action_methods ||= begin\n          # All public instance methods of this class, including ancestors except for\n          # public instance methods of Base and its ancestors.\n          methods = public_instance_methods(true) - internal_methods\n          # Be sure to include shadowed public instance methods of this class.\n          methods.concat(public_instance_methods(false))\n          methods.reject! { |m| m.start_with?(\"_\") }\n          methods.map!(&:name)\n          methods.to_set\n        end\n      end\n```\nPrevious versions didn't have this (```methods.reject! { |m| m.start_with?(\"_\") }```), and then suddenly, bam, it appeared! Why is that?\n\n## Expected behavior\nPlease return everything to how it was before — it's not up to you to decide whether I can use methods with start underscore for actions or not.\n\n### System configuration\n\n**Rails version**: 8.1.0\n\n**Ruby version**: 3.4.7\n","closed_by":{"login":"rafaelfranca","id":47848,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3ODQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47848?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelfranca","html_url":"https://github.com/rafaelfranca","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelfranca/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelfranca/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelfranca/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelfranca/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelfranca/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelfranca/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelfranca/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelfranca/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelfranca/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/55985/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/55985/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
