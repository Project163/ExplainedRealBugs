Motivation / Background\r\n\r\n$ rails new foo --devcontainer --pretend\r\ncurrently fails as the `DevcontainerGenerator` doesn't receive the pretend-option.\r\nThis currently results in a .devcontainer folder being created in CWD, followed by a templating error that halts the process.\r\n\r\nFix #53441\r\n\r\n### Detail\r\n\r\nThis PR passes the pretend-option to the `DevcontainerGenerator` so it won't generate anything (and then blow up), and instead just show the files it would create:\r\n```\r\n...\r\n      create  tmp/storage/.keep\r\n      create  .devcontainer\r\n      create  .devcontainer/devcontainer.json\r\n      create  .devcontainer/Dockerfile\r\n      create  .devcontainer/compose.yaml\r\n      create

Ex: `[Fix #issue-number]`\r\n* [X] Tests are added or updated if you fix a bug or add a feature.\r\n* ~~[ ] CHANGELOG files are updated for the changed libraries if there is a behavior change or additional feature.
