I made the change locally and now all the tests run clean.\r\nHere is an example of the contents of `@bundle_commands` on line 416:\r\n```\r\ninstall\r\nlock --add-platform=x86_64-linux\r\nlock --add-platform=aarch64-linux\r\nexec rails plugin new /Users/fredwillmore/OtherDocuments/ruby_projects/rails/railties/test/fixtures/tmp/bukkits/myproject --main\r\n```\r\nIt looks like a second `lock` command with `--add-platform=aarch64-linux` is at issue here. This command is added here:\r\nhttps://github.com/rails/rails/blob/main/railties/lib/rails/generators/app_base.rb#L690-L691\r\nSo this is a special case for arm64 macs. (I am using an M2 Pro, running macOS 13.6) The solution I used locally would not be suitable for use on any other platform.\r\n\r\n### to reproduce\r\n`bin/test test/generators/plugin_generator_test.rb`\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\ntests pass\r\n\r\n### Actual behavior\r\ntests on matching bundle commands fail\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\nrails 7.2.0.alpha\r\nruby 3.2.2\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"jonathanhefner","id":771968,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc3MTk2OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/771968?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonathanhefner","html_url":"https://github.com/jonathanhefner","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonathanhefner/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonathanhefner/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonathanhefner/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonathanhefner/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonathanhefner/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonathanhefner/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonathanhefner/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonathanhefner/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonathanhefner/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/50168/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/50168/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
