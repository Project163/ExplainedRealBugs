is an inherit complexity with wrapping the Rack body inside Rails which can lead to bugs, like #49588.\r\n\r\nWhile #49616 fixed the bug, it's probably not a good long-term solution.\r\n\r\nIf we go all the way back to 6a89850d, we can see this was the original behavior. However, we were trying to solve a separate issue with streaming bodies during disconnect.\r\n\r\nThe `live_stream_test#test_abort_with_full_buffer` test fails in this PR, but I wanted to raise that maybe this could be handled a different way.\r\n\r\nAlso there are two failures in `response_test` which are questions to me:\r\n\r\n* `ResponseTest#test_[response.to_a].flatten_does_not_recurse_infinitely`\r\n* `ResponseTest#test_compatibility_with_Rack::ContentLength`\r\n\r\nThe first seems it is actually resolved upstream, per this comment: https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/47092#discussion_r1087250243\r\n\r\nThe second means we broke `Rack::ContentLength` and there is a bit on this in #44953.\r\n\r\nFWIW: I'm not proposing this PR exactly, but looking for a path forward and would love some feedback. :bow:\r\n\r\n/cc @ioquatix

to Rails 7.1, returning an Enumerator in a view rendered the content correctly. However, starting from Rails 7.1, it appears to render only the Enumerator's string representation (Enumerator#to_s), resulting in a response like `\"#<Enumerator:0xXXXXXX>\"`.\r\n\r\nSetting `self.response_body = Enumerator.new` in an action works for both 7.0 and 7.1 (fixed in https://github.com/rails/rails/issues/49588).\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\n# frozen_string_literal: true\r\n\r\nrequire \"bundler/inline\"\r\n\r\ngemfile(true) do\r\n  source \"https://rubygems.org\"\r\n\r\n  git_source(:github) { |repo| \"https://github.com/#{repo}.git\" }\r\n\r\n  # gem \"rails\", \"~> 7.0.0\" # => works\r\n  gem \"rails\", \"~> 7.1.0\" # => fails\r\nend\r\n\r\nrequire \"action_controller/railtie\"\r\n\r\nclass TestApp < Rails::Application\r\n  config.root = __dir__\r\n  config.hosts << \"example.org\"\r\n  config.secret_key_base = \"secret_key_base\"\r\n\r\n  config.logger = Logger.new($stdout)\r\n  Rails.logger  = config.logger\r\n\r\n  routes.draw do\r\n    get \"enumerator_in_action\", controller: :test\r\n    get \"enumerator_in_view\", controller: :test\r\n  end\r\nend\r\n\r\nclass TestController < ActionController::Base\r\n  def enumerator_in_action\r\n    self.response_body = Enumerator.new do |buff|\r\n      10.times { buff << _1.to_s }\r\n    end\r\n  end\r\n\r\n  def enumerator_in_view\r\n    render inline: <<~EOS, layout: false, type: :ruby\r\n      Enumerator.new do |buff|\r\n        10.times { buff << _1.to_s }\r\n      end\r\n    EOS\r\n  end\r\nend\r\n\r\nrequire \"minitest/autorun\"\r\nrequire \"rack/test\"\r\n\r\nclass BugTest < Minitest::Test\r\n  include Rack::Test::Methods\r\n\r\n  def test_enumerator_in_action\r\n    get \"/enumerator_in_action\"\r\n    assert_equal \"0123456789\", last_response.body\r\n  end\r\n\r\n  def test_enumerator_in_view\r\n    get \"/enumerator_in_view\"\r\n    assert_equal \"0123456789\", last_response.body\r\n  end\r\n\r\n  private\r\n\r\n    def app\r\n      Rails.application\r\n    end\r\nend\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\n\r\nThe content should be rendered by evaluating the Enumerator.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure whether it is guaranteed behavior in specification when it's returned from view, but I expect it works as was the case until Rails 7.0.\r\n\r\n### Actual behavior\r\n\r\nIt currently renders the Enumerator's string representation, such as \"#<Enumerator:0xXXXXXX>\".\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n**Rails version**: 7.1.3\r\n\r\n**Ruby version**:
