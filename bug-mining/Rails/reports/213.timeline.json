contributors write a good description for their pull requests.\r\nWe'd like you to provide a description of the changes in your pull request (i.e. bugs fixed or features added), the motivation behind the changes, and complete the checklist below before opening a pull request.\r\n\r\nFeel free to discard it if you need to (e.g. when you just fix a typo). -->\r\n\r\n### Motivation /

Unrelated changes should be opened in separate PRs.\r\n* [x] Commit message has a detailed description of what changed and why. If this PR fixes a related issue include it in the commit message. Ex: `[Fix #issue-number]`\r\n* [x] Tests are added or updated if you fix a bug or add a feature.\r\n* [ ] CHANGELOG files are updated for the changed libraries if there is a behavior change or additional feature. Minor bug fixes and documentation changes should not be included.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/52116/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":1,"confused":0,"heart":1,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/52116/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/2165540977","html_url":"https://github.com/rails/rails/issues/52114#issuecomment-2165540977","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/52114","id":2165540977,"node_id":"IC_kwDNIULOgROIcQ","user":{"login":"ccasabona","id":6371874,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzNzE4NzQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6371874?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ccasabona","html_url":"https://github.com/ccasabona","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ccasabona/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ccasabona/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ccasabona/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ccasabona/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ccasabona/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ccasabona/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ccasabona/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ccasabona/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ccasabona/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-06-13T12:39:06Z","updated_at":"2024-06-13T12:39:06Z","body":"This

Just want to check, are there plans on the merging the PR fix provided by @chrisdebruin ? :) \n\nAlso facing the same issue, and IMHO, I think that users of Rails should not have to explicitly handle this error. Similar to errors registered in `ActionDispatch::ExceptionWrapper` is being handled in `actionpack/lib/action_dispatch/middleware/debug_exceptions.rb`. \n\nThanks in advance!","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/2650072229/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":1},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"severedsea","id":5338851,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzMzg4NTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5338851?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/severedsea","html_url":"https://github.com/severedsea","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/severedsea/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/severedsea/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/severedsea/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/severedsea/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/severedsea/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/severedsea/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/severedsea/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/severedsea/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/severedsea/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":16260015465,"node_id":"MEE_lADNIULOjBuIzc8AAAADySwlaQ","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/events/16260015465","actor":{"login":"chrisdebruin","id":289727,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4OTcyNw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/289727?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdebruin","html_url":"https://github.com/chrisdebruin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdebruin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdebruin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdebruin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdebruin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdebruin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdebruin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdebruin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdebruin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdebruin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2025-02-11T08:07:22Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":16260015477,"node_id":"SE_lADNIULOjBuIzc8AAAADySwldQ","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/events/16260015477","actor":{"login":"chrisdebruin","id":289727,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4OTcyNw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/289727?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdebruin","html_url":"https://github.com/chrisdebruin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdebruin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdebruin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdebruin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdebruin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdebruin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdebruin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdebruin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdebruin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrisdebruin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2025-02-11T08:07:22Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":16263331072,"node_id":"SE_lADNIULOjBuIzc8AAAADyV69AA","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/events/16263331072","actor":{"login":"chao-xian","id":424772,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyNDc3Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/424772?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chao-xian","html_url":"https://github.com/chao-xian","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chao-xian/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chao-xian/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chao-xian/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chao-xian/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chao-xian/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chao-xian/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chao-xian/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chao-xian/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chao-xian/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2025-02-11T11:47:03Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/

Motivation / Background\r\n\r\nWe encountered a lot of errors when bots were firing malformed requests at our servers. In query strings, when bad **values** are supplied, these get checked and the request gets killed. However, when bad **keys** are supplied, there will be a 500 error. This pull request fixes #52114 (and replaces #52116)\r\n\nA coleague of mine already attempted a fix in the other repo, but the tests are still failing (didn't fix the issue) so I took another shot at it. Shout out to Chris for pinpointing where in the code I had to look!\n\r\n### Detail\r\n\r\nThis Pull Request add a little encoding check in the parsing of query strings.
