this template\r\n\r\nThe following template aims to help contributors write a good description for their pull requests.\r\nWe'd like you to provide a description of the changes in your pull request (i.e. bugs fixed or features added), motivation behind the changes, and complete the checklist below before opening a pull request.\r\n\r\nFeel free to discard it if you need to (e.g. when you just fix a typo). -->\r\n\r\n### Motivation / Background\r\n\r\n<!-- Describe why this Pull Request needs to be merged. What bug have you fixed? What feature have you added? Why is it important? -->\r\n\r\nThis Pull Request has been created because https://github.com/rails/rails/issues/46239\r\n\r\n### Detail\r\n\r\nThe docs imply that when specified the `on` option of `validates_associated` should be respected by the validated association. Prior to this change the validation context used will simply be the default behavior as if no `on` option were specified. With this change, the validation_context of the parent record is passed to the `valid?` check.\r\n\r\n### Additional information\r\n\r\n<!-- Provide additional information such as benchmarks, reference to other repositories or alternative solutions. -->\r\n\r\n### Checklist\r\n\r\nBefore submitting the PR make sure the following are checked:\r\n\r\n* [x] This Pull Request is related to one change. Changes that are unrelated should be opened in separate PRs.\r\n* [x] There are no typos in commit messages and comments.\r\n* [x] Commit message has a detailed description of what changed and why. If this PR fixes a related issue include it in the commit message. Ex: `[Fix #issue-number]`\r\n* [x] Feature branch is up-to-date with `main` (if not - rebase it).\r\n* [x] Pull request only contains one commit for bug fixes and small features. If it's a larger feature, multiple commits are permitted but must be descriptive.\r\n* [x] Tests are added if you fix a bug or add a feature.\r\n* [x] CHANGELOG files are updated for the changed libraries if there is a behavior change or additional feature. Minor bug fixes and documentation changes should not be included.\r\n* [x] PR is not in a draft state.\r\n* [x] CI is passing.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nNote: Please avoid making *Draft* pull requests, as they still send\r\nnotifications to everyone watching the Rails repo.\r\nCreate a pull request when it is ready for review and feedback\r\nfrom the Rails team :).\r\n\r\nIf your pull request affects documentation or any non-code\r\nchanges, guidelines for those changes are [available\r\nhere](https://edgeguides.rubyonrails.org/contributing_to_ruby_on_rails.html#contributing-to-the-rails-documentation)\r\n\r\nThanks for contributing to Rails!
