is looking at some minor changes to how they parse query strings, but we have learned hard-won lessons about changing even edge case behaviours.\r\n\r\nSimultaneously, this narrow instance has highlighted a more general situation: prior to Rack 3, we always had the option to adopt our own parameter parsing strategy (e.g. if we wanted to invent some meaning for a structured parameter name of `foo[@]/bar` or something). As Rack 3 eliminated the obligation for the input body to be rewindable, only the first-to-read is guaranteed to be able to see the full set of parameters.\r\n\r\nThe Rack side of this has been alleviated via https://github.com/rack/rack/pull/2088 -- it's still true that only the first reader can parse the input, and ecosystem consistency requires that reader to be Rack... but it will now provide a more literal, less processed, view of the parameters it saw.\r\n\r\nHere, we adopt that new raw parameter list (where available), and do the structured parsing for ourselves.\r\n\r\nInterestingly, this allows us to be more direct in getting to a true Rails parameter set: indifferent hash access, nil munging, and string encoding controls can all be applied as we go, instead of through post-processing.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThe intention is that there are no observable behaviour changes here: the only short-term effect will be to insulate us from future-Rack's https://github.com/rack/rack/pull/2098.\r\n\r\nThis PR _will_ result in new/different internal exception classes being raised for various invalid-parameter situations, but apart from changing spelling of some log messages, I'm not sure it's practical, let alone likely, for an application to be seeing/rescuing them: we already translate the Rack exceptions to `ActionController::BadRequest`, and here maintain that translation for the new ones.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/53193/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":1,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/53193/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/2425808058","html_url":"https://github.com/rails/rails/issues/53394#issuecomment-2425808058","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/53394","id":2425808058,"node_id":"IC_kwDNIULOkJbkug","user":{"login":"Earlopain","id":14981592,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0OTgxNTky","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14981592?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Earlopain","html_url":"https://github.com/Earlopain","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Earlopain/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Earlopain/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Earlopain/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Earlopain/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Earlopain/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Earlopain/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Earlopain/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Earlopain/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Earlopain/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-10-21T07:10:52Z","updated_at":"2024-10-21T07:10:52Z","body":"If

my current thought is that the best option might be to silently adopt the Rack 3 behaviour if Rack 3 (or more accurately, not-Rack-2) is present [so we don't regress/change behaviour for people already using Rack 3], but then when Rack 2, use a config setting:\r\n\r\nDefault to `\"&;\"`, `load_defaults` it to `\"&\"`, deprecation warning if the application doesn't set it (and is using Rack 2).\r\n\r\nIf the config is set, we should follow it regardless of Rack version.\r\n\r\nThat way: if someone is already on Rack 3 [or upgrades to Rack 3 at the same time as Rails 8.0], they have already [or will then] follow the Rack 3 upgrade path (silent switch-over, 🤷🏻‍♂️)... but anyone who upgrades to Rails 8.0 while still on Rack 2 will keep the Rack 2 behaviour for now, while we can also proactively nudge them to be explicit about what they want.\r\n\r\n(All the \"middleware/proxies might disagree = danger zone\" stuff applies as soon as Rails and Rack apply different opinions,

folks, wanted to add another example of a regression that appeared after upgrading Rails to include parsing changes.\r\n\r\nIn our case the application started to parse queries with nested structure in a different (broken) way. However while preparing the reproduction script I realized that in our case the same failure happens when using rack `3` which I suppose means that the application is the one that needs to change here as it won't be compatible with rack 3. And the change in Rails just revealed this incompatibility earlier. \r\n\r\nSo I'm mainly sharing for additional and to potentially think of a possibility to provide a better heads-up for applications that may experience the same.\r\n\r\nOn a side note, I'd like to learn if `[cart][apple]=1&[cart][banana]=2\"` format was even officially supported or just happened to work. Because if it was intentionally supported it could mean much higher rate of applications relying on it and breaking in ambiguous ways when migrating to rack3 or next rails version.\r\n**Update**:  https://github.com/rack/rack/issues/2128 this leads me to believe that it should be considered an application problem \r\n\r\n<details>\r\n<summary>Reproduction script</summary>\r\n\r\n  ```ruby\r\n  require \"bundler/inline\"\r\n\r\n  gemfile(true) do\r\n    source \"https://rubygems.org\"\r\n\r\n    # with parsing changes\r\n    gem \"rails\", github: \"rails/rails\", branch: \"main\", ref: \"d64611bc5a71a749d10c4da295e80fe182b5d7ea\"\r\n\r\n    # without parsing changes\r\n    # gem \"rails\", github: \"rails/rails\", branch: \"main\", ref: \"e83cfa5466255d48cf03308dfe5d183eb8444d51\"\r\n\r\n    gem \"rack\", \"~> 2\"\r\n  end\r\n\r\n  require \"action_controller/railtie\"\r\n\r\n  class TestApp < Rails::Application\r\n    config.root = __dir__\r\n    config.hosts << \"example.org\"\r\n    config.secret_key_base = \"secret_key_base\"\r\n\r\n    config.logger = Logger.new($stdout)\r\n    Rails.logger  = config.logger\r\n\r\n    routes.draw do\r\n      get \"/foo\" => \"test#index\"\r\n    end\r\n  end\r\n\r\n  class TestController < ActionController::Base\r\n    include Rails.application.routes.url_helpers\r\n\r\n    def index\r\n      render(plain: params.to_s)\r\n    end\r\n  end\r\n\r\n  require \"minitest/autorun\"\r\n  require \"rack/test\"\r\n\r\n  class BugTest < ActiveSupport::TestCase\r\n    include Rack::Test::Methods\r\n\r\n    QUERIES = [\r\n      \"cart[apple]=1&cart[banana]=2\", # the only format that keeps working against any version rails/rack\r\n      \"[cart][apple]=1&[cart][banana]=2\",\r\n      \"cart%5D%5Bapple%5D=1&%5Bcart%5D%5Bbanana%5D=2\",\r\n    ]\r\n\r\n    def test_controller_returns_success\r\n      expected = %({\"cart\"=>{\"apple\"=>\"1\", \"banana\"=>\"2\"}, \"controller\"=>\"test\", \"action\"=>\"index\"})\r\n      QUERIES.each_with_index do |query, index|\r\n        get(\"/foo?#{query}\")\r\n        assert_equal(expected, last_response.body, \"Query with index #{index} failed.

running under Rack 3, we'll proceed with the new behaviour. That means we won't affect applications that already use Rack 3, but does also mean we can't help an application that is simultaneously bumping Rails and Rack together. 🤷🏻‍♂️\r\n\r\nHowever, with this commit, we at least ensure we maintain compatibility for applications that are currently still on Rack 2 -- and we can help with the transition using deprecation warnings... though there's admittedly a decent chance such warnings will only show up in production.\r\n\r\nFixes
