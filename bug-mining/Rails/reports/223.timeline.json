Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\n1. Use `BroadcastLogger#broadcast_to(logger)` to add a new logger\r\n2. Use `BroadcastLogger#tagged(\"MyTag\")` without a block to return a new tagged logger\r\n3. Try to use that new tagged logger\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\n# frozen_string_literal: true\r\n\r\nrequire \"bundler/inline\"\r\n\r\ngemfile(true) do\r\n  source \"https://rubygems.org\"\r\n\r\n  git_source(:github) { |repo| \"https://github.com/#{repo}.git\" }\r\n\r\n  gem \"rails\", github: \"rails/rails\", branch: \"main\"\r\n  gem \"pry\"\r\nend\r\n\r\nrequire \"active_support\"\r\nrequire \"active_support/core_ext/object/blank\"\r\nrequire \"minitest/autorun\"\r\n\r\nclass BugTest < Minitest::Test\r\n  def test_broadcast_to_multiple_tagged_loggers\r\n    iologger1 = Logger.new($stdout)\r\n    iologger1 = ActiveSupport::TaggedLogging.new(iologger1)\r\n\r\n    logger = ActiveSupport::BroadcastLogger.new(iologger1)\r\n\r\n    # This works fine\r\n    logger.tagged(\"Test1\").info(\"OK\")\r\n\r\n    iologger2 = Logger.new($stderr)\r\n    iologger2 = ActiveSupport::TaggedLogging.new(iologger2)\r\n\r\n    logger.broadcast_to(iologger2)\r\n\r\n    # This works fine\r\n    logger.tagged(\"Test1\") { _1.info \"OK\" }\r\n\r\n    # Now we have a problem. `logger.tagged` returns an Array\r\n    # NoMethodError: undefined method `info' for [#<Logger\r\n    #\r\n    # https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/ca5132b78a44677f708045905dc1b092a02f6b30/activesupport/lib/active_support/broadcast_logger.rb#L242\r\n    logger.tagged(\"Test2\").info(\"OK\")\r\n\r\n    # We'll never get here, but this fails\r\n    assert logger.is_a?(ActiveSupport::BroadcastLogger)\r\n  end\r\nend\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\n\r\nUsing `ActiveSupport::BroadcastLogger#tagged` without a block returns a tagged logger that can be used for logging as normal.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Actual behavior\r\n\r\nWhen broadcasting to more than one logger that supports tagging, an `Array` is returned rather than an object that you can log to directly.\r\n\r\nThe specific use case where this came up: in some tests, I want to capture logs so I can test them. Previously I was replacing `Rails.logger` entirely, but now I tried adding and removing a broadcast target and I noticed this didn't work.\r\n\r\nThis appears to be caused by the `method_missing` implementation:\r\nhttps://github.com/rails/rails/blob/ca5132b78a44677f708045905dc1b092a02f6b30/activesupport/lib/active_support/broadcast_logger.rb#L242\r\n\r\n<!-- Tell us what happens instead -->\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n**Rails version**: 7.1.1\r\n\r\n**Ruby version**: 3.2.2\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/49757/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/49757/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":10753771199,"node_id":"AE_lADNIULOdKH1xM8AAAACgPmGvw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/events/10753771199","actor":{"login":"eileencodes","id":1080678,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwODA2Nzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1080678?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/eileencodes","html_url":"https://github.com/eileencodes","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eileencodes/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eileencodes/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eileencodes/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eileencodes/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eileencodes/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eileencodes/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eileencodes/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eileencodes/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eileencodes/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"assigned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2023-10-24T13:14:29Z","assignee":{"login":"Edouard-chin","id":8122246,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxMjIyNDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8122246?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Edouard-chin","html_url":"https://github.com/Edouard-chin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Edouard-chin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Edouard-chin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Edouard-chin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Edouard-chin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Edouard-chin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Edouard-chin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Edouard-chin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Edouard-chin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Edouard-chin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/1777183797","html_url":"https://github.com/rails/rails/issues/49745#issuecomment-1777183797","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/49745","id":1777183797,"node_id":"IC_kwDNIULOae2sNQ","user":{"login":"eileencodes","id":1080678,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwODA2Nzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1080678?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/eileencodes","html_url":"https://github.com/eileencodes","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eileencodes/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eileencodes/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eileencodes/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eileencodes/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eileencodes/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eileencodes/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eileencodes/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eileencodes/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eileencodes/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-10-24T13:15:01Z","updated_at":"2023-10-24T13:15:13Z","body":"hey @Edouard-chin I saw that you mentioned you saw this one on the other issue so I assigned this to you too.

### Context\r\n\r\n  The Tagged Logging functionality has been a source of a few issues over the years, especially when combined with the broadcasting feature. Initializating a Tagged Logger was also not very intuitive:\r\n\r\n  ```ruby \r\n  logger = Logger.new(STDOUT)\r\n  tagged_logger = ActiveSupport::TaggedLogging.new(logger)\r\n  # Would expect the `tagged_logger` to be an instance of `AS::TaggedLogging` \r\n  # but it's a clone of the `logger`.\r\n\r\n  tagged_logger.formatter = ->(_, _, _, message) do\r\n    { message: message }\r\n  end\r\n  # Modifies the formatter to output JSON formatted logs.\r\n  # This breaks tagged logging.\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n  I believe the main reason of those issues is because tagged logging is implemented at the wrong level.\r\n\r\n  ### Solution\r\n\r\n  I made a proposal on the Ruby logger upstream in ruby/logger#90 to help solve this but it hasn't been reviewed yet. So I thought about adding it here for now. The TL;DR is to decouple formatting and adding extra information to logs (which is what tagged logging does).\r\n\r\n  ### Deprecation\r\n\r\n  Since TaggedLogging will no longer access the formatter, there is a few things I'd like to deprecate such as setting a default formatter https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/d68e43922bc11829c52ad9f736ad5549fc97631b/activesupport/lib/active_support/tagged_logging.rb#L124 but doing so in this PR would increase the size of the diff significantly and would maybe distract for PR reviews.\r\n\r\n  Another thing that I believe should be deprecated is `ActiveSupport::TaggedLogging.new`. Adding tagging functionality to a logger should be done using a more ruby approach such as `logger.extend(AS::TaggedLogging)`.\r\n\r\n-------------------\r\n\r\nFix #49757 \r\nFix #49745 \r\nFix
