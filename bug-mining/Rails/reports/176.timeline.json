Motivation / Background\r\n\r\nIssue #52227 pointed out that any argument error in a template with strict locals would be swallowed and replaced by an exception with unrelated backtrace, which made debugging templates difficult.\r\n\r\nFixes #52227\r\n\r\n\r\n### Detail\r\n\r\nArgument errors related to strict locals in templates now raise an `ActionView::StrictLocalsError`, and all other `ArgumentError` exceptions are reraised as-is.\r\n\r\nPreviously, any `ArgumentError` raised during template rendering was swallowed during strict local error handling, so that an `ArgumentError` unrelated to strict locals (e.g., a helper method invoked with incorrect arguments) would be replaced by a similar `ArgumentError` with an unrelated backtrace, making it difficult to debug templates.\r\n\r\nNow, any `ArgumentError` unrelated to strict locals is reraised, preserving the original backtrace for developers.\r\n\r\nAlso note that `ActionView::StrictLocalsError` is a subclass of `ArgumentError`, so any existing code that rescues `ArgumentError` will continue to work.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Additional information\r\n\r\nIt's not necessary to introduce a new exception type to solve this problem, but doing so encapsulates the \"strict locals\" error message construction nicely, making `ActionView::Base#_run` a bit more readable.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Checklist\r\n\r\nBefore submitting the PR make sure the following are checked:\r\n\r\n* [x] This Pull Request is related to one change. Unrelated changes should be opened in separate PRs.\r\n* [x] Commit message has a detailed description of what changed and why. If this PR fixes a related issue include it in the commit message. Ex: `[Fix #issue-number]`\r\n* [x] Tests are added or updated if you fix a bug or add a feature.\r\n* [x] CHANGELOG files are updated for the changed libraries if there is a behavior change or additional feature. Minor bug fixes and documentation changes should not be included.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/54133/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":1,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/54133/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/2573791799","html_url":"https://github.com/rails/rails/issues/52227#issuecomment-2573791799","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/52227","id":2573791799,"node_id":"IC_kwDNIULOmWjyNw","user":{"login":"flavorjones","id":8207,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgyMDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8207?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/flavorjones","html_url":"https://github.com/flavorjones","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/flavorjones/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/flavorjones/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/flavorjones/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/flavorjones/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/flavorjones/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/flavorjones/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/flavorjones/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/flavorjones/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/flavorjones/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-01-06T19:42:02Z","updated_at":"2025-01-06T19:42:02Z","body":"I've
