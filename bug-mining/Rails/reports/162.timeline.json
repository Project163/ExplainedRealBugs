I've just noticed a similar issue with `select` - if I have a table alias and reference the aliased table in a `where` call, the alias is applied, but if not, then it uses the original table name. This makes conditionally chaining queries annoying depending on what conditions are applied. E.g. in my application, I have different filters applied to a query depending on the user, and then I `select` some additional fields onto the object from the joined relations, but I have to reference the joined table with different names depending on whether the table was referenced in the `where` clauses.\r\n\r\nIn this test case, I have two models, Post, and PostComment, but the relation on Post is just called `comments`. If I add the `where` clause then I can include the joined table fields using the `comments` alias, but otherwise I have to use the original `post_comments` table name.\r\n\r\nI'm seeing this on Rails

by the way, it seems like the latest changes on `main` have broken my [similar test case](https://github.com/rails/rails/issues/53509#issuecomment-2451009352) further - now it turns `select(posts: [\"*\"])` into `SELECT \"posts\".\"*\"` instead of `SELECT posts.*` which fails because `\"*\"` is not a column name. Now, I don't know if it was ever intended for `select` to work that way, I was kind of pleasantly surprised when I wrote that query and it worked, but just wanted to mention it in case that's something that should still be working. Thank you!\r\n\r\nEdit: Ah yeah, even if I remove that \"posts\".\"*\" bit I'm seeing that the other part of the select also no longer works because it's quoted. So maybe we're just not meant to be able to do that with a hash argument to `select` and it was lucky coincidence that it wasn't quoting that column name so that we could do more complex things with it.\r\n\r\nActiveRecord::StatementInvalid: SQLite3::SQLException: no such column: comments.title as comment:\r\n```sql\r\nSELECT \"comments\".\"title as comment\" FROM \"posts\" INNER JOIN
