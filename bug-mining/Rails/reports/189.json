While testing some automatic role-switching middleware and relying on our test suite to detect writes in read-only mode, we encountered a hanging test. We traced the issue to a pessimistic lock being acquired using with_lock (`SELECT ... FOR UPDATE`) while using the reader role, followed by switching to the writer role to update the same row. This resulted in a deadlock, as the `UPDATE` transaction waited on the `SELECT ... FOR UPDATE` lock, and vice versa.\r\n\r\nFrom my understanding, PostgreSQL would have raised an error (`ERROR:  cannot execute SELECT FOR UPDATE in a read-only transaction`) if this had been attempted in a read-only role, as it would in our production environment. Therefore, I believe Rails could potentially raise an error in this scenario as well (maybe with differing behavior based on the adapter).\r\n\r\nPlease let me know if a PR to raise an error in this case would be accepted and I can send one 👍🏽\r\n\r\n<!-- Paste your executable test case created from one of the scripts found [here](https://edgeguides.rubyonrails.org/contributing_to_ruby_on_rails.html#create-an-executable-test-case) below: -->\r\n```ruby\r\n# frozen_string_literal: true\r\n\r\nrequire \"bundler/inline\"\r\n\r\ngemfile(true) do\r\n  source \"https://rubygems.org\"\r\n\r\n  gem \"rails\", github: \"rails/rails\", branch: \"main\"\r\n\r\n  gem \"pg\", \"~> 1.1\"\r\nend\r\n\r\nrequire \"active_record/railtie\"\r\nrequire \"minitest/autorun\"\r\n\r\nActiveRecord::Base.logger = Logger.new(STDOUT)\r\n\r\n# Note: This script requires a local PostgresQL database `primary`\r\nconfig = YAML.load(<<~YAML)\r\n  development:\r\n    primary:\r\n      adapter: postgresql\r\n      database: primary\r\n    replica:\r\n      adapter: postgresql\r\n      database: primary\r\n      replica: true\r\nYAML\r\nActiveRecord::Base.configurations = config\r\n\r\nActiveRecord::Base.establish_connection :primary\r\n\r\nActiveRecord::Schema.define do\r\n  create_table :posts, force: :cascade do |t|\r\n    t.text :title\r\n  end\r\nend\r\n\r\nclass ApplicationRecord < ActiveRecord::Base\r\n  primary_abstract_class\r\n\r\n  connects_to database: { writing: :primary, reading: :replica }\r\nend\r\n\r\nclass Post < ApplicationRecord\r\nend\r\n\r\nclass BugTest < ActiveSupport::TestCase\r\n  def test_pessimistic_lock_with_database_switch\r\n    post = Post.create!(title: \"original\")\r\n    ApplicationRecord.connected_to(role: :reading) do\r\n      post.with_lock do\r\n        ApplicationRecord.connected_to(role: :writing) do\r\n          post.update!(title: \"updated\")\r\n        end\r\n      end\r\n    end\r\n  end\r\nend\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\n<!-- Tell us what should happen -->\r\n\r\nAn error should be raised telling me that a lock cannot be obtained when in readonly mode, similar to: https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/07bf01aba4904ff2f9eb5cfd11b33c5d46db26a8/activerecord/lib/active_record/connection_adapters/abstract_adapter.rb#L208\r\n\r\n### Actual behavior\r\n<!-- Tell us what happens instead -->\r\n\r\nIt hangs indefinitely.\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\n**Rails version**: Edge\r\n\r\n**Ruby version**: 3.4.0preview2","closed_by":{"login":"byroot","id":44640,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0NjQw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/44640?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/byroot","html_url":"https://github.com/byroot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/byroot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/byroot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/byroot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/byroot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/byroot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/byroot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/byroot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/byroot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/byroot/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/53758/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/53758/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
