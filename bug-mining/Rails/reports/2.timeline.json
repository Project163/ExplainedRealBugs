Seed `18309` resulted in no failures, while seed `49319` resulted in failures for all three tests that called `ActionText::Content.new.append_attachables`. \r\n\r\nAfter a little more inspection, I determined that when the failures occurred, both `render` and `default_renderer` were nil in the `ActionText::Rendering` module's `render` method. \r\n\r\n`append_attachables` calls the  `render` method, but as those three failing tests are currently written there's no invocation of a controller preceding the call to `append_attachables`, so there's no chance for the `renderer` or `default_renderer` variables to be set. \r\n\r\nTo confirm that's the case, I can add `controller = MessagesController` to those tests, and all three pass, even with the bad seed. That also works on `bin/test test/integration/mailer_render_test.rb --seed 17477`. \r\n\r\nSo tests that call `render` will pass if they are preceded by tests that set up the controller and the previous renderer, which accounts for the intermittent failures. That also explains why running the whole suite is fine.  \r\n\r\nTo address this problem, the default renderer could be set in `test_helper`:\r\n```ruby\r\nActionText::Content.default_renderer = Class.new(ActionController::Base).renderer\r\n```\r\n\r\nOr the default renderer could be set in the `render` method if it doesn't already exist:\r\n```ruby\r\ndef render(*args, &block)\r\n  default_renderer ||= Class.new(ActionController::Base).renderer\r\n  (renderer || default_renderer).render_to_string(*args, &block)\r\nend\r\n```\r\n\r\nI don't know if either of those proposals are ideal solutions, but I'm happy to make a pull request.

Changes that are unrelated should be opened in separate PRs.\r\n* [ ] There are no typos in commit messages and comments.\r\n* [x] Commit message has a detailed description of what changed and why. If this PR fixes a related issue include it in the commit message. Ex: `[Fix #issue-number]`\r\n* [x] Feature branch is up-to-date with `main` (if not - rebase it).\r\n* [x] Pull request only contains one commit for bug fixes and small features. If it's a larger feature, multiple commits are permitted but must be descriptive.\r\n* [ ] Tests are added if you fix a bug or add a feature.\r\n* [ ] CHANGELOG files are updated for the changed libraries if there is a behavior change or additional feature. Minor bug fixes and documentation changes should not be included.\r\n* [x] PR is not in a draft state.\r\n* [x] CI is passing.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nNote: Please avoid making *Draft* pull requests, as they still send\r\nnotifications to everyone watching the Rails repo.\r\nCreate a pull request when it is ready for review and feedback\r\nfrom the Rails team :).\r\n\r\nIf your pull request affects documentation or any non-code\r\nchanges, guidelines for those changes are [available\r\nhere](https://edgeguides.rubyonrails.org/contributing_to_ruby_on_rails.html#contributing-to-the-rails-documentation)\r\n\r\nThanks for contributing to Rails! -->\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/46129/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/46129/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
