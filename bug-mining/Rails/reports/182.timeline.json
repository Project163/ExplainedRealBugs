We mention how `*_path` works with various examples and suddenly use a code snippet that don't use the `*_path` method.\r\n\r\n  Modified the doc to use `product_path(product.id)`, to make it explicit. While it's longer, it's clearer, especially since we are in the \"getting started guide\"\r\n\r\n  I don't think mentioning how `link_to(product)` works is a good idea in this guide, the `link_to` accepts a crazy amount of different values with many heuristics to determine the url to generate. This is documented in the action view guide and in the API.
