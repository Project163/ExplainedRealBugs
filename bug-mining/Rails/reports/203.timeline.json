Motivation / Background\r\n\r\nFix #54890\r\n\r\n### Detail\r\n\r\n#### Problem\r\n\r\nCalling `polyphormic_url` in a integration test or anywhere else when routes may not be loaded yet will result in either crashing or returning a wrong url.\r\n\r\n#### Details\r\n\r\nWhen the routes are not yet loaded, any `resolve` routes are not taken in consideration when calling `polymorphic_url`.\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\n  # config/routes.rb\r\n  resolve(\"Post\") { \"https://example.org\" }\r\n\r\n  # test.rb\r\n  polymorphic_url(@post) # Crash: `post_url` is not defined.\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Solution\r\n\r\nLoad the routes when `polymorphic_mappings` ultimately gets called by `polymorphic_url` https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/42a71a03a0adb465dc49b4e21dec8e0ea29e8e35/actionpack/lib/action_dispatch/routing/polymorphic_routes.rb#L179\r\n\r\n\r\n### Additional information\r\n\r\nIt's worth to note that `polymorphic_url` was previously overriden to load the routes, but it only worked if one attempted to call it on the singleton route's url_helpers:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\n  class MyTest < ActionDispatch::IntegrationTest\r\n    test \"example\" do\r\n      # Works correctly on main\r\n      Rails.application.routes.url_helpers.polymorphic_url(@post)\r\n\r\n      # Does not work without this patch\r\n      polymorphic_url(@post)\r\n    end\r\n  end\r\n```\r\n\r\nI removed the previous implementation as it was overidden on the wrong methods.\r\n\r\n### Checklist\r\n\r\nBefore submitting the PR make sure the following are checked:\r\n\r\n* [x] This Pull Request is related to one change. Unrelated changes should be opened in separate PRs.\r\n* [x] Commit message has a detailed description of what changed and why. If this PR fixes a related issue include it in the commit message. Ex: `[Fix #issue-number]`\r\n* [x] Tests are added or updated if you fix a bug or add a feature.\r\n* [ ] CHANGELOG files are updated for the changed libraries if there is a behavior change or additional feature. Minor bug fixes and documentation changes should not be included.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/54904/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/54904/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":17216342835,"node_id":"LE_lADNIULOsZIBL88AAAAEAiyLMw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/events/17216342835","actor":{"login":"zzak","id":277819,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3NzgxOQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/277819?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zzak","html_url":"https://github.com/zzak","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zzak/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zzak/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zzak/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zzak/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zzak/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zzak/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zzak/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zzak/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zzak/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2025-04-11T02:00:08Z","label":{"name":"attached
