Generate a new Rails project from master with `rails new testproject --master`\r\n2. Run `rubocop`\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\nRunning Rubocop linter on a new project should not generate any issues\r\n\r\n### Actual behavior\r\nLine 105 of config/environments/production.rb generates an issue by violating the Layout/SpaceInsideArrayLiteralBracket rule\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n**Rails version**: master branch, commit [9716991](https://github.com/rails/rails/commit/97169912f197eee6e76fafb091113bddf624aa67)\r\n\r\n**Ruby version**: 3.3.5\r\n\r\n### Notes\r\nI see four options:\r\n- Un-comment the custom rule from the generated .rubocop.yml that would not make this fail\r\n- Exclude config/environments/production.rb from rubocop linting (of this rule)\r\n- Disable the rule for the line in /config/environments/production.rb\r\n- Use spaces to conform to the rule","closed_by":{"login":"rafaelfranca","id":47848,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3ODQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47848?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelfranca","html_url":"https://github.com/rafaelfranca","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelfranca/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelfranca/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelfranca/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelfranca/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelfranca/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelfranca/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelfranca/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelfranca/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelfranca/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/52986/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/52986/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
