reason to trigger a save on the Picture record when updating a field on CaliforniaEmployee, since the picture record is already correctly pointing at the existing Employee.\r\n\r\n### Actual behavior\r\n<!-- Tell us what happens instead -->\r\n\r\n`inverse_polymorphic_association_changed?` is returning true for this use case causing a subsequent autosave to be triggered on Picture, leading to a failure in both test cases:\r\n\r\n```\r\nFailure:\r\nBugTest#test_association_not_saved_on_update [rails-issue.rb:73]:\r\nExpected: 2\r\n  Actual: 3\r\n\r\nFailure:\r\nBugTest#test_association_saved_on_actual_model_change [rails-issue.rb:85]:\r\nExpected: 3\r\n  Actual: 4\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Additional Context\r\n\r\nThis appears to specifically fail when the has_one is defined on a child class using Single-table Inheritance. If the `has_one` in the test case above is moved up to the `Employee` model, then the expectation will pass.\r\n\r\nThe issue appears to be here: https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/83702d64c80637cc0debc3917c3419d327f8ee1b/activerecord/lib/active_record/autosave_association.rb#L495-L497.\r\n\r\nThat currently reads the class for the record from the `foreign_type` and then attempts to convert it to the right class for polymorphic relationships, but I believe this is unnecessary, since it already would have been converted to the correct type when set.\r\n\r\nInstead `reflection.active_record` should actually be updated to use the `polymorphic_name` otherwise we risk looking at the wrong model name that would be ultimately saved.\r\n\r\nUpdating line 497 to this gets these test cases passing for me:\r\n\r\n```\r\nreflection.active_record.polymorphic_name != class_name\r\n```\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n**Rails version**: 7.1.3.2, main\r\n\r\n**Ruby version**: 3.2.2\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"byroot","id":44640,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0NjQw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/44640?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/byroot","html_url":"https://github.com/byroot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/byroot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/byroot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/byroot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/byroot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/byroot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/byroot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/byroot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/byroot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/byroot/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/51280/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/51280/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
