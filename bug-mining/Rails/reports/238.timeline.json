Motivation / Background\r\n\r\nFixes #55917.\r\n\r\n### Detail\r\n\r\nWhen creating a SQL literal with bind value parameters, `Arel.sql` returns an instance of `Arel::Nodes::BoundSqlLiteral`, which is not currently supported by `#build_with_expression_from_value`.\r\n\r\nThis Pull Request updates the method to accept both `Arel::Nodes::SqlLiteral` and `Arel::Nodes::BoundSqlLiteral`.\r\n\r\n###
