Make a change to `guides/assets/stylesrc/_dark.scss`\r\n2. run `bundle exec rake guides:generate`\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\nI would expect the changes I made to `guides/assets/stylesrc/_dark.scss` to be reflected in\r\n`output/stylesheets/style.css`\r\n\r\n### Actual behavior\r\nThe `process_scss` method of `guides/rails_guides/generator.rb` generates the correct css files\r\nand writes them to `output/stylesheets`.\r\n\r\nThe `copy_assets` method of `generator.rb` then copies the stylesheets from `guides/assets/stylesheets` to `output/stylesheets` overwriting the newly generated stylesheets.\r\n\r\n### Solution\r\n\r\n#51444 added `style.css` and `hilight.css` to the `assets/stylesheets` directory. Either those files should be removed or the `process_scss` method should output to the `assets/stylesheets` directory.","closed_by":{"login":"carlosantoniodasilva","id":26328,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MzI4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26328?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/carlosantoniodasilva","html_url":"https://github.com/carlosantoniodasilva","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/carlosantoniodasilva/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/carlosantoniodasilva/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/carlosantoniodasilva/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/carlosantoniodasilva/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/carlosantoniodasilva/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/carlosantoniodasilva/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/carlosantoniodasilva/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/carlosantoniodasilva/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/carlosantoniodasilva/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/51454/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/51454/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
