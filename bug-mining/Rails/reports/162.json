What we see is that the `order` case _didn't_ use a table alias. This makes constructing filtering and sorting queries difficult, especially when they're created by the user (think a table with filters and optional sorting).\r\n\r\nAn example:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nclass Comment < ApplicationRecord\r\n  scope :order_by_post_title, ->(direction) { joins(:post).order('post.title') }\r\n  scope :with_titled_post, -> { joins(:post).where.not(post: { title: nil }) }\r\nend\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn this case `order_by_post_title` only works when `with_titled_post` is used. The developer might then try...\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nclass Comment < ApplicationRecord\r\n  scope :order_by_post_title, ->(direction) { joins(:post).order('posts.title') }\r\n  scope :with_titled_post, -> { joins(:post).where.not(post: { title: nil }) }\r\nend\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd now the opposite is true!\r\n\r\nThe ideal scenario is that I don't really need to know what ActiveRecord is doing under the hood. The ideal is:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nclass Comment < ApplicationRecord\r\n  scope :order_by_post_title, ->(direction) { joins(:post).order(post: { title: direction }) } # Hash, just like where\r\n  scope :with_titled_post, -> { joins(:post).where.not(post: { title: nil }) }\r\nend\r\n```\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\n**Rails version**: 7.1+ (I've tested on v8 too)\r\n\r\n**Ruby version**: 3.3.4","closed_by":{"login":"kamipo","id":12642,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNjQy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12642?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kamipo","html_url":"https://github.com/kamipo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kamipo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kamipo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kamipo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kamipo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kamipo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kamipo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kamipo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kamipo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kamipo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/53509/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/53509/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
