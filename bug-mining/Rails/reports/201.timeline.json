Motivation / Background\r\n\r\nFix #54830 (This indirectly fix the issue)\r\n\r\n### Problem\r\n\r\nThe `create_or_find_by` method doesn't allow rolling back a transaction. This is a different behaviour `create`. The reason is because we are in the double transaction edge case and the outer transaction doesn't see the rollback.\r\n\r\n### Details\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nclass User < ApplicationRecord\r\n  after_save do\r\n    raise ActiveRecord::Rollback\r\n  end\r\nend\r\n\r\nUser.create(name: \"John\") #=> Correctly rolled back\r\nUser.find_or_create_by(name: \"John\") #=> Correctly rolled back on Rails 7.0, stopped rolling back since commit 023a3eb3c046091a5d52027393a6d29d0576da01\r\nUser.create_or_find_by(name: \"John\") #=> Does not roll back\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Solution\r\n\r\nWe need to be able to know whether the inner transaction succeeded, which is not possible using `.create`, as this method always returns the record (rather than the status of the transaction). https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/1eac7f27748ffa43c5ce91c036c928fc22d4c597/activerecord/lib/active_record/persistence.rb#L39\r\n\r\nUsing `new` followed by a save is equivalent to `create`, but with `save` we get the transaction return status and we can properly rollback the outer transaction.\r\n\r\n### Checklist\r\n\r\nBefore submitting the PR make sure the following are checked:\r\n\r\n* [x] This Pull Request is related to one change. Unrelated changes should be opened in separate PRs.\r\n* [x] Commit message has a detailed description of what changed and why. If this PR fixes a related issue include it in the commit message. Ex: `[Fix #issue-number]`\r\n* [x] Tests are added or updated if you fix a bug or add a feature.\r\n* [x] CHANGELOG files are updated for the changed libraries if there is a behavior change or additional feature. Minor bug fixes and documentation changes should not be included.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/54845/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":1,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/54845/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":17060664140,"node_id":"REFE_lADNIULOsEawK88AAAAD-OUTTA","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/events/17060664140","actor":{"login":"Edouard-chin","id":8122246,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxMjIyNDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8122246?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Edouard-chin","html_url":"https://github.com/Edouard-chin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Edouard-chin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Edouard-chin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Edouard-chin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Edouard-chin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Edouard-chin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Edouard-chin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Edouard-chin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Edouard-chin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Edouard-chin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"9733962f7cb49f516613d7afb61998eb5dc48c1d","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Edouard-chin/rails/commits/9733962f7cb49f516613d7afb61998eb5dc48c1d","created_at":"2025-03-31T16:52:52Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":17091350066,"node_id":"REFE_lADNIULOsEawK88AAAAD-rlOMg","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/events/17091350066","actor":{"login":"Edouard-chin","id":8122246,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxMjIyNDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8122246?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Edouard-chin","html_url":"https://github.com/Edouard-chin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Edouard-chin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Edouard-chin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Edouard-chin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Edouard-chin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Edouard-chin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Edouard-chin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Edouard-chin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Edouard-chin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Edouard-chin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"2a984359016e2275a7ca5d24bc260638884d55da","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Edouard-chin/rails/commits/2a984359016e2275a7ca5d24bc260638884d55da","created_at":"2025-04-02T10:29:30Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":17126807166,"node_id":"LE_lADNIULOsEawK88AAAAD_NZWfg","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/events/17126807166","actor":{"login":"yahonda","id":73684,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjczNjg0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/73684?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yahonda","html_url":"https://github.com/yahonda","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yahonda/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yahonda/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yahonda/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yahonda/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yahonda/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yahonda/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yahonda/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yahonda/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yahonda/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2025-04-04T09:25:37Z","label":{"name":"activerecord","color":"0b02e1"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":17147777054,"node_id":"REFE_lADNIULOsEawK88AAAAD_hZQHg","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/events/17147777054","actor":{"login":"byroot","id":44640,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0NjQw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/44640?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/byroot","html_url":"https://github.com/byroot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/byroot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/byroot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/byroot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/byroot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","su
