However, it should fail validation because it's longer than the byte length limit of bcrypt, as described in the documentation.\r\n\r\nTo be technically correct, it seems the validation should happen on `bytesize`, not `length`. Is this an implementation error or a documentation issue?\r\n\r\nPrevious submissions like #22617, #22870, and #25045 don't seem to have clarified this issue any further.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"guilleiguaran","id":160941,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MDk0MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/160941?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/guilleiguaran","html_url":"https://github.com/guilleiguaran","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guilleiguaran/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guilleiguaran/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guilleiguaran/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guilleiguaran/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guilleiguaran/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guilleiguaran/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guilleiguaran/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guilleiguaran/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guilleiguaran/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/47600/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/47600/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
