Motivation / Background\r\n\r\nThis Pull Request has been created because since #55496, the depreciation message about `raise_on_open _redirects` is shown in newly generated applications.\r\n\r\nThis is because the deprecations is shown when `raise_on_open_redirects` is not null, but the default value of it is `false`. https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/ec4337aae7d358e9d8ae3fc539347a2618b8fbe0/actionpack/lib/action_controller/railtie.rb#L110

checked the key existence for the condition of deprecation message to avoid the deprecation message in newly generated applications.\r\n\r\nFixes #55772.\r\n\r\n### Additional information\r\n\r\n<!-- Provide additional information such as benchmarks, references to other repositories, or alternative solutions. -->\r\n\r\n### Checklist\r\n\r\nBefore submitting the PR make sure the following are
