PR fixes issue #50003 where using `super` after adding relations to the subclass or defining filter attributes in the subclass in the method `self.inherited` lead to warnings and removed previously defined filter_attributes.\r\n\r\n### Motivation / Background\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nDescribe why this Pull Request needs to be merged. What bug have you fixed? What feature have you added? Why is it important?\r\nIf you are fixing a specific issue, include \"Fixes #ISSUE\" (replace with the issue number, remove the quotes) and the issue will be linked to this PR.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nFixes #50003.\r\n\r\n### Detail\r\n\r\nI only added the `||=` to `@filter_attributes` and `@generated_association_methods`, the other 3 variables in this code should not be affected. That way, only two additional `OR` operations are introduced.\r\n\r\n### Additional information\r\n\r\nI added some tests as well, if the tests are run in an environment with [strict warnings enabled](https://edgeguides.rubyonrails.org/contributing_to_ruby_on_rails.html#warnings) it also verifies that the constant mentioned in #50003 is not redefined.\r\n\r\n### Checklist\r\n\r\nBefore submitting the PR make sure the following are checked:\r\n\r\n* [x] This Pull Request is related to one change. Changes that are unrelated should be opened in separate PRs.\r\n* [x] Commit message has a detailed description of what changed and why. If this PR fixes a related issue include it in the commit message. Ex: `[Fix #issue-number]`\r\n* [x] Tests are added or updated if you fix a bug or add a feature.\r\n* [x] CHANGELOG files are updated for the changed libraries if there is a behavior change or additional feature. Minor bug fixes and documentation changes should not be included.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/50012/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/50012/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/1806496068","html_url":"https://github.com/rails/rails/issues/50003#issuecomment-1806496068","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/50003","id":1806496068,"node_id":"IC_kwDNIULOa6zxRA","user":{"login":"Adrian-Hirt","id":13788379,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNzg4Mzc5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13788379?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Adrian-Hirt","html_url":"https://github.com/Adrian-Hirt","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Adrian-Hirt/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Adrian-Hirt/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Adrian-Hirt/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Adrian-Hirt/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Adrian-Hirt/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Adrian-Hirt/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Adrian-Hirt/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Adrian-Hirt/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Adrian-Hirt/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-11-10T22:04:01Z","updated_at":"2023-11-10T22:04:01Z","body":"Thanks,
