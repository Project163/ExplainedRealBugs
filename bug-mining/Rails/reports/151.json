[this change in `InsertAll`](https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/48139/files) the value of a custom `DateTime` attribute is not saved when using an integer timestamp.\n\nThis happens in a specific case when using a custom timestamp attribute, which should save the value as an integer timestamp but behave like a `DateTime` column in Rails.\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\n```ruby\n# frozen_string_literal: true\n\nrequire \"bundler/inline\"\n\ngemfile(true) do\n  source \"https://rubygems.org\"\n  \n  # gem \"rails\"\n  \n  # If you want to test against edge Rails replace the previous line with this:\n  gem \"rails\", github: \"rails/rails\", branch: \"main\"\n  \n  gem \"sqlite3\"\nend\n\nrequire \"active_record\"\nrequire \"minitest/autorun\"\nrequire \"logger\"\n\nActiveRecord::Base.establish_connection(adapter: \"sqlite3\", database: \":memory:\")\nActiveRecord::Base.logger = Logger.new(STDOUT)\nActiveRecord::Base.time_zone_aware_attributes = true\nActiveRecord.default_timezone = :local\n\nActiveRecord::Schema.define do\n  create_table :posts, force: true do |t|\n    t.bigint :expires_at\n  end\nend\n\nclass EpochTimestamp < ActiveRecord::Type::DateTime\n  def deserialize(time_or_int)\n    Time.at(time_or_int).utc if time_or_int\n  end\n  \n  def serialize(time)\n    time.to_i if time\n  end\nend\n\nActiveRecord::Type.register(:epoch_timestamp, EpochTimestamp)\n\nclass Post < ActiveRecord::Base\n  attribute :expires_at, :epoch_timestamp\nend\n\nclass BugTest < ActiveSupport::TestCase\n  def test_custom_timestamp_with_insert_all\n    timestamp = Time.current.utc\n    \n    Post.insert_all!([{expires_at: timestamp.to_i}]) # this will not save the integer timestamp\n    \n    assert_equal timestamp.to_i, Post.last.expires_at.to_i # Post.last.expires_at == nil\n  end\nend\n```\n\nI created this issue to discuss if this is a potential breaking change for more users and if it can be fixed upstream.
