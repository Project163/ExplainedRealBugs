Otherwise, it is treated as an action.\r\n\r\nFor a bit more details, this is how `options` is set for `render \"locals\", locals: { secret: \"area51\" }` in `_normalize_args ` method:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\n{\r\n  :action: \"locals\"\r\n  :layout: #<Proc:0x000000011194d650>\r\n  :locals: {:secret=>\"area51\"}\r\n  :prefixes: [\"render_template/without_layout\"]\r\n  :template: \"locals\"\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd this is how `options` variable is set for `render template: \"locals\", locals: { secret: \"area51\" }`:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\n{\r\n  :layout: #<Proc:0x0000000113156f08>\r\n  :locals: {:secret=>\"area51\"}\r\n  :template:

for contributing to Rails!\r\n\r\nPlease do not make *Draft* pull requests, as they still send\r\nnotifications to everyone watching the Rails repo.\r\n\r\nCreate a pull request when it is ready for review and feedback\r\nfrom the Rails team :).\r\n\r\nIf your pull request affects documentation or any non-code\r\nchanges, guidelines for those changes are [available\r\nhere](https://edgeguides.rubyonrails.org/contributing_to_ruby_on_rails.html#contributing-to-the-rails-documentation)\r\n\r\nAbout this template\r\n\r\nThe following template aims to help contributors write a good description for their pull requests.\r\nWe'd like you to provide a description of the changes in your pull request (i.e. bugs fixed or features added), motivation behind the changes, and complete the checklist below before opening a pull request.\r\n\r\nFeel free to discard it if you need to (e.g. when you just fix a typo). -->\r\n\r\n### Motivation / Background\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nDescribe why this Pull Request needs to be merged. What bug have you fixed? What feature have you added? Why is it important?\r\nIf you are fixing a specific issue, include \"Fixes #ISSUE\" (replace with the issue number, remove the quotes) and the issue will be linked to this PR.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis Pull Request has been created to close https://github.com/rails/rails/issues/46724.\r\n\r\n### Detail\r\n\r\nThis Pull Request updates the `ActionPack` render template with locals tests to:\r\n- Include a `\"with a leading slash\"` test so that these are consistent with the render template directory tests.\r\n- Use the`with_locals_without_key` helper method instead of `with_locals` for the `\"rendering a template with local variables without key\"` test. This method has also been updated to include a slash in the template string as required for path arg normalization when the template key is excluded.\r\n\r\n### Additional information\r\n\r\n<!-- Provide additional information such as benchmarks, reference to other repositories or alternative solutions. -->\r\n\r\nI think the summary in [this section of the guides](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/layouts_and_rendering.html#wrapping-it-up) makes it quite clear that using a path without a slash and without the `template:` key would search for an action in the current controller, and therefore doesn't require updating.\r\n\r\n### Checklist\r\n\r\nBefore submitting the PR make sure the following are checked:\r\n\r\n* [x] This Pull Request is related to one change. Changes that are unrelated should be opened in separate PRs.\r\n* [x] Commit message has a detailed description of what changed and why. If this PR fixes a related issue include it in the commit message. Ex: `[Fix #issue-number]`\r\n* [x] Tests are added or updated if you fix a bug or add a feature.\r\n* [x] CHANGELOG files are updated for the changed libraries if there is a behavior change or additional feature.
