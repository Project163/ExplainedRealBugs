This happens both in the latest Rails (currently 8.0.2) and in `main`.\n\nAs far as I can tell Rails is committed to support whitespace-only passwords (#25373, #16412), and since they trigger actual changes to the password digest I think it would make sense to align the validation logic to this use case (IMHO it would just make a better default).\n\nI've already taken a quick look at the code; I wasn't able to find any tests documenting the current behavior is intended. But I did find a possible fix, so I volunteer to open a PR should the core team approve the change.\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\n<!-- (Guidelines for creating a bug report are [available\nhere](https://edgeguides.rubyonrails.org/contributing_to_ruby_on_rails.html#creating-a-bug-report)) -->\n\n<!-- Paste your executable test case created from one of the scripts found [here](https://edgeguides.rubyonrails.org/contributing_to_ruby_on_rails.html#create-an-executable-test-case) below: -->\n```ruby\n# frozen_string_literal: true\n\nrequire \"bundler/inline\"\n\ngemfile(true) do\n  source \"https://rubygems.org\"\n  gem \"rails\", github: \"rails/rails\", branch: \"main\"\n  gem \"sqlite3\"\n  gem \"bcrypt\", \"~> 3.1.7\"\nend\n\nrequire \"active_record/railtie\"\nrequire \"minitest/autorun\"\n\nENV[\"DATABASE_URL\"] = \"sqlite3::memory:\"\n\nclass TestApp < Rails::Application\n  config.load_defaults Rails::VERSION::STRING.to_f\n  config.eager_load = false\n  config.logger = Logger.new($stdout)\n  config.secret_key_base = \"secret_key_base\"\n\n  config.active_record.encryption.primary_key = \"primary_key\"\n  config.active_record.encryption.deterministic_key = \"deterministic_key\"\n  config.active_record.encryption.key_derivation_salt = \"key_derivation_salt\"\nend\nRails.application.initialize!\n\nActiveRecord::Schema.define do\n  create_table :users, force: true do |t|\n    t.string :password_digest, null: false\n  end\nend\n\nclass User < ActiveRecord::Base\n  has_secure_password\nend\n\nclass BugTest < ActiveSupport::TestCase\n  test \"create new user with whitespace password and wrong password confirmation\" do\n    user = User.new(password: \" \", password_confirmation: \"anything\")\n\n    assert_not user.valid?(:create), \"user should not be valid\"\n  end\n\n  test \"update existing user with whitespace password and wrong password confirmation\" do\n    user = User.create!(password: \"password\", password_confirmation: \"password\")\n\n    user.password = \" \"\n    user.password_confirmation = \"anything\"\n\n    assert_not user.valid?(:update), \"user should not be valid\"\n  end\nend\n```\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nThe validation should fail if the password and the password confirmation strings are different, no matter if the password is a sequence of whitespace-only characters.\n\n### Actual behavior\n\nIf the password is a sequence of whitespace-only characters, the validation succeeds regardless of the contents of the confirmation string.\n\n### System configuration\n\n**Rails version**: 8.0.2, `main@1ac4003547`\n\n**Ruby version**: 3.4.4\n","closed_by":{"login":"byroot","id":44640,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0NjQw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/44640?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/byroot","html_url":"https://github.com/byroot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/byroot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/byroot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/byroot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/byroot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/byroot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/byroot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/byroot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/byroot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/byroot/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/55225/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/55225/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
