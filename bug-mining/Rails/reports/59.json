In [one of the latest PRs](https://github.com/cockroachdb/activerecord-cockroachdb-adapter/pull/284) I have decided to overload the `Arel::Nodes::JoinSource` class to contain a new attribute, hence I also needed to override `==`, `eql?` and `hash`. This lead me to failing this test condition:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/rails/rails/blob/910eb470c5c2f1871117893fc33f5443bde8bf8d/activerecord/test/cases/arel/nodes_test.rb#L23\r\n\r\nLooking at the [commit message](https://github.com/rails/rails/commit/6d225a9870aea1fa25ab71774206d08d5b216355) introducing this condition:\r\n\r\n> * that the class defining all 3 is also a descendant of Node, to avoid the default ones that rely on identity only\r\n\r\nIt feels like the test condition could be changed to something like: `subnode.instance_method(:==).super_method != nil`.\r\n\r\nI can definitely do that in the adapter codebase (and will). But I'm opening this PR for two reasons:\r\n\r\n1. Being sure I'm not overlooking an important aspect of the owner being descendent of `Arel::Nodes::Node`\r\n2. Upstreaming the change to benefit the community if I'm not misleading!\r\n\r\nThank you for the dedication,\r\nUlysse\r\n\r\nP.S: there are plenty of options to loosen this condition, I've chosen one arbitrarily here, but I can look deeper for sure!\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"byroot","id":44640,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0NjQw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/44640?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/byroot","html_url":"https://github.com/byroot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/byroot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/byroot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/byroot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/byroot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/byroot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/byroot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/byroot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/byroot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/byroot/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/49274/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/49274/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
