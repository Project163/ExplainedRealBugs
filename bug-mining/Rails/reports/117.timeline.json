#51914\r\n\r\n### Motivation / Background\r\n\r\nThis change brings `ActionCable::Connection::TestCookieJar` in alignment with `ActionDispatch::Cookies::CookieJar` in regards to setting the cookie value.\r\n\r\nBefore:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\ncookies[:foo] = { value: \"bar\" }\r\nputs cookies[:foo] # => { value: \"bar\" }\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\ncookies[:foo] = { value: \"bar\" }\r\nputs cookies[:foo] # => \"bar\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Additional information\r\n\r\nTechnically this is a breaking change but I don't know why the user would depend on an incorrect interface.\r\n\r\n### Checklist\r\n\r\nBefore submitting the PR make sure the following are checked:\r\n\r\n* [x] This Pull Request is related to one change. Unrelated changes should be opened in separate PRs.\r\n* [x] Commit message has a detailed description of what changed and why. If this PR fixes a related issue include it in the commit message. Ex: `[Fix #issue-number]`\r\n* [x] Tests are added or updated if you fix a bug or add a feature.\r\n* [ ] CHANGELOG files are updated for the changed libraries if there is a behavior change or additional feature. Minor bug fixes and documentation changes should not be included.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/51930/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":1,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/51930/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":12962685596,"node_id":"REFE_lADNIULOihSwJ88AAAADBKLinA","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/events/12962685596","actor":{"login":"rafaelfranca","id":47848,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3ODQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47848?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelfranca","html_url":"https://github.com/rafaelfranca","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelfranca/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelfranca/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelfranca/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelfranca/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelfranca/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelfranca/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelfranca/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelfranca/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelfranca/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"24472e01c184fea7d76c8af49006ddc546c7f16a","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/justinko/rails/commits/24472e01c184fea7d76c8af49006ddc546c7f16a","created_at":"2024-05-28T20:09:46Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":12962834724,"node_id":"CE_lADNIULOihSwJ88AAAADBKUpJA","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/events/12962834724","actor":{"login":"rafaelfranca","id":47848,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3ODQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47848?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelfranca","html_url":"https://github.com/rafaelfranca","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelfranca/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelfranca/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelfranca/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelfranca/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelfranca/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelfranca/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelfranca/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelfranca/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelfranca/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2024-05-28T20:24:16Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":13091796404,"node_id":"REFE_lADNIULOihSwJ88AAAADDFT1tA","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/events/13091796404","actor":{"login":"xjunior","id":8156,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxNTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8156?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xjunior","html_url":"https://github.com/xjunior","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xjunior/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xjunior/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xjunior/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xjunior/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xjunior/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xjunior/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xjunior/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xjunior/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xjunior/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"48360e5aa467f308faaf8757836dcfe17c088575","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/xjunior/rails/commits/48360e5aa467f308faaf8757836dcfe17c088575","created_at":"2024-06-09T15:41:59Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":13417923669,"node_id":"REFE_lADNIULOihSwJ88AAAADH8VEVQ","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/events/13417923669","actor":{"login":"Set2005","id":209831,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwOTgzMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/209831?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Set2005","html_url":"https://github.com/Set2005","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Set2005/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Set2005/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Set2005/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Set2005/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/use
