@collimarco 👋\n\nHave you tried using the [send_early_hints](https://api.rubyonrails.org/v7.2.2.2/classes/ActionDispatch/Request.html#method-i-send_early_hints) helper? For example:\n\n```ruby\n<%= send_early_hints(\n    \"Link\" => \"<#{url_for(@restaurant.cover_image)}>; rel=preload; as=image; fetchpriority=high\"\n  )\n%>\n\n<%= preload_link_tag url_for(@restaurant.cover_image), as: 'image', fetchpriority: 'high' %>\n\n```\n\nAlternatively, you could also achieve the same effect at the CDN level, so the browser can start preloading assets even before Rails renders the page.
