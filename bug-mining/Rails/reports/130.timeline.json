#52588.\r\n\r\n### Motivation / Background\r\n\r\nThis Pull Request has been created because `bin/rails dbconsole` does not work inside a Docker container for sqlite3 apps.\r\n\r\n### Detail\r\n\r\nThis Pull Request changes the `Rails::Generators::Database::SQLite3#base_package` method (ultimately called by the `Dockerfile.tt` template) to use the `sqlite3` package instead of `libsqlite3-0`. `sqlite3` [depends on](https://packages.debian.org/bookworm/sqlite3) `libsqlite3-0`, so everything still works.\r\n\r\n### Checklist\r\n\r\nBefore submitting the PR make sure the following are checked:\r\n\r\n* [x] This Pull Request is related to one change. Unrelated changes should be opened in separate PRs.\r\n* [x] Commit message has a detailed description of what changed and why. If this PR fixes a related issue include it in the commit message. Ex: `[Fix #issue-number]`\r\n* [x] Tests are added or updated if you fix a bug or add a feature.\r\n* [ ] CHANGELOG files are updated for the changed libraries if there is a behavior change or additional feature. Minor bug fixes and documentation changes should not be included.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/52589/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/52589/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":13856629669,"node_id":"REFE_lADNIULOksH9ps8AAAADOetjpQ","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/events/13856629669","actor":{"login":"jeromedalbert","id":236461,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzNjQ2MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/236461?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeromedalbert","html_url":"https://github.com/jeromedalbert","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeromedalbert/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeromedalbert/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeromedalbert/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeromedalbert/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeromedalbert/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeromedalbert/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeromedalbert/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeromedalbert/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeromedalbert/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"6217333f08561348743a6d718f20eb906ec53831","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jeromedalbert/rails/commits/6217333f08561348743a6d718f20eb906ec53831","created_at":"2024-08-13T01:53:38Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":13857312027,"node_id":"LE_lADNIULOksH9ps8AAAADOfXNGw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/events/13857312027","actor":{"login":"skipkayhil","id":6014046,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYwMTQwNDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6014046?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/skipkayhil","html_url":"https://github.com/skipkayhil","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skipkayhil/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skipkayhil/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skipkayhil/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skipkayhil/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skipkayhil/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skipkayhil/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skipkayhil/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skipkayhil/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skipkayhil/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2024-08-13T04:00:33Z","label":{"name":"attached
