Motivation / Background\r\n\r\nFixes #53106\r\n\r\nOmitting the `.tt` extension has the effect that the files (which are bundled with the Rails gem) are treated as Ruby files by editors. This means the code inside them will show up as library code, and can affect editor actions. For example, in RubyMine \"Go to Declaration\" now offers this code as a valid target when trying to navigate to a \"User\" model.\r\n\r\n### Detail\r\n\r\nThis Pull Request changes the authentication generator template files to all have a `.tt` extension.\r\n\r\n### Checklist\r\n\r\nBefore submitting the PR make sure the following are checked:\r\n\r\n* [x] This Pull Request is related to one change. Unrelated changes should be opened in separate PRs.\r\n* [x] Commit message has a detailed description of what changed and why. If this PR fixes a related issue include it in the commit message. Ex: `[Fix #issue-number]`\r\n* [ ] ~~Tests are added or updated if you fix a bug or add a feature.~~\r\n   I haven't updated the tests as the code works both with and without the `.tt` extension; this fix is to address the impact of not having the extension on editors and tooling while working with Rails applications.\r\n* [x] CHANGELOG files are updated for the changed libraries if there is a behavior change or additional feature. Minor bug fixes and documentation changes should not be included.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/53145/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/53145/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":14482755102,"node_id":"CE_lADNIULOmFDofc8AAAADXz1OHg","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/events/14482755102","actor":{"login":"guilleiguaran","id":160941,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MDk0MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/160941?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/guilleiguaran","html_url":"https://github.com/guilleiguaran","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guilleiguaran/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guilleiguaran/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guilleiguaran/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guilleiguaran/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guilleiguaran/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guilleiguaran/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guilleiguaran/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guilleiguaran/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guilleiguaran/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2024-10-02T05:11:43Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":14510793761,"node_id":"REFE_lADNIULOmFDofc8AAAADYOkkIQ","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/events/14510793761","actor":{"login":"DanielaVelasquez","id":15008564,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MDA4NTY0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15008564?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/DanielaVelasquez","html_url":"https://github.com/DanielaVelasquez","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DanielaVelasquez/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DanielaVelasquez/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DanielaVelasquez/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DanielaVelasquez/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DanielaVelasquez/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DanielaVelasquez/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DanielaVelasquez/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DanielaVelasquez/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DanielaVelasquez/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"8910f5ec8520e9b5d8ef7fb207704873f4912cef","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DanielaVelasquez/rails/commits/8910f5ec8520e9b5d8ef7fb207704873f4912cef","created_at":"2024-10-03T21:59:05Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
