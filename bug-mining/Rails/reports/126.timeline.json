However, it's unable to differentiate whether that update happened as a result of a direct validate/save (new regression), or an validate/autosave by the child itself (original issue).\r\n\r\nThis PR ensures that the duplicate validation/autosave of the child is only avoided if it originated from the validating/autosaving of the parent by the child.\r\n\r\n### Additional information\r\n\r\n<!-- Provide additional information such as benchmarks, references to other repositories, or alternative solutions. -->\r\n\r\n### Checklist\r\n\r\nBefore submitting the PR make sure the following are checked:\r\n\r\n* [x] This Pull Request is related to one change. Unrelated changes should be opened in separate PRs.\r\n* [x] Commit message has a detailed description of what changed and why. If this PR fixes a related issue include it in the commit message.
