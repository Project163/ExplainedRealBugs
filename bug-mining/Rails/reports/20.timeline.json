Motivation / Background\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes the [issue](https://github.com/rails/rails/issues/46784) with `request.raw_post` property being empty for chunked requests. (Transfer-Encoding header present and without a Content-Length value). It was inspired from this previous [PR](https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/37423), but without the need of doing a second `rewind` of the request body.\r\n\r\nA similar fix was done on [Puma webserver](https://github.com/puma/puma/pull/2287), but with this fix, `raw_post` will work as expected for any Rack based http server.\r\n\r\n### Detail\r\n\r\nThis pull request changes `ActionDispatch::Request#raw_post` and `ActionDispatch::Request#content_length` methods, to take into account the presence of `Transfer-Encoding` header or not.\r\n\r\nAccording to [HTTP/1.1](https://httpwg.org/specs/rfc9112.html#rfc.section.6.2) RFC, when `Transfer-Encoding` is present, a sender must not send a `Content-Length` header field on a request, so because of that we can't rely on that field when reading the raw request body stream and calculating its content length for the upstream app.\r\n\r\nSo what this change does is to read the entire requests's `body_stream` for `raw_post` instead of using `content_length` as its length when `Transfer-Encoding` header is present.\r\n\r\nAnd it uses the `raw_post#bytesize` value to calculate the request's `content_length` instead of reading this value from the `Content-Length` header, when `Transfer-Encoding` header is present.\r\n\r\n### Additional information\r\n\r\nTo test this case an integration railties test `http_request_test.rb` was used, in order for it to be similar to real use cases.\r\n\r\nIt is also recommended to test this change manually with a real Rails app running on different Rack servers (e.g. Puma, Unicorn, Webrick or Thin)\r\n\r\n### Checklist\r\n\r\nBefore submitting the PR make sure the following are checked:\r\n\r\n* [x] This Pull Request is related to one change. Changes that are unrelated should be opened in separate PRs.\r\n* [x] Commit message has a detailed description of what changed and why.
