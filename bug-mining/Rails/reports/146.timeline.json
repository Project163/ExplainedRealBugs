   belongs_to :left, dependent: :destroy\r\n      belongs_to :right, dependent: :destroy\r\n    end\r\n\r\n    class Right < ActiveRecord::Base\r\n      has_one :middle, dependent: :destroy\r\n      has_one :left, through: :middle\r\n    end\r\n\r\nHowever this only worked from one end.  When destroying the \"non-working\" end, the join model was correctly destroyed but the other end was not.\r\n\r\nIn the example above:\r\n\r\n- `right.destroy` correctly destroys its `middle` and its `left`;\r\n- `left.destroy` destroys its `middle` but not its `right`.\r\n\r\nThe end which worked depended on the order of `belongs_to` statements in the join model.\r\n\r\nThis commit ensures that the no matter which end you destroy, the far end is destroyed (along with the join record).\r\n\r\nFixes #50948.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Checklist\r\n\r\nBefore submitting the PR make sure the following are checked:\r\n\r\n* [x] This Pull Request is related to one change.
