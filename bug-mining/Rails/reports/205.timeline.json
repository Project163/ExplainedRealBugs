Motivation / Background\r\n\r\nFixes https://github.com/rails/rails/issues/54966\r\n\r\n### Detail\r\n\r\nThis Pull Request changes `ActionView::Helpers::Tags::Select#grouped_choices?` to do type checking instead of duck typing.\r\n\r\nThis avoids calling `second` on arbitrary objects.\r\n\r\nIn the issue above, it's calling `.second` on an `ActiveRecord` class, triggering a database call.\r\n\r\n### Additional information\r\n\r\n<!-- Provide additional information such as benchmarks, references to other repositories, or alternative solutions. -->\r\n\r\n### Checklist\r\n\r\nBefore submitting the PR make sure the following are checked:\r\n\r\n* [x] This Pull Request is related to one change. Unrelated changes should be opened in separate PRs.\r\n* [x] Commit message has a detailed description of what changed and why. If this PR fixes a related issue include it in the commit message. Ex: `[Fix #issue-number]`\r\n* [x] Tests are added or updated if you fix a bug or add a feature.\r\n* [ ] CHANGELOG files are updated for the changed libraries if there is a behavior change or additional feature. Minor bug fixes and documentation changes should not be included.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/54967/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/54967/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":17394196811,"node_id":"REFE_lADNIULOs9hWkM8AAAAEDMZhSw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/events/17394196811","actor":{"login":"lavoiesl","id":1216046,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMTYwNDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1216046?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lavoiesl","html_url":"https://github.com/lavoiesl","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lavoiesl/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lavoiesl/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lavoiesl/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lavoiesl/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lavoiesl/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lavoiesl/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lavoiesl/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lavoiesl/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lavoiesl/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"474ff5556f59c47c12e028050f35324400c4dafe","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/lavoiesl/rails/commits/474ff5556f59c47c12e028050f35324400c4dafe","created_at":"2025-04-24T17:01:44Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":17403657110,"node_id":"CE_lADNIULOs9hWkM8AAAAEDVa7lg","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/events/17403657110","actor":{"login":"byroot","id":44640,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0NjQw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/44640?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/byroot","html_url":"https://github.com/byroot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/byroot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/byroot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/byroot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/byroot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/byroot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/byroot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/byroot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/byroot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/byroot/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2025-04-25T09:47:41Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":17403657160,"node_id":"CE_lADNIULOs9hWkM8AAAAEDVa7yA","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/events/17403657160","actor":{"login":"byroot","id":44640,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0NjQw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/44640?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/byroot","html_url":"https://github.com/byroot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/byroot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/byroot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/byroot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/byroot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/byroot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/byroot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/byroot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/byroot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/byroot/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":"474ff5556f59c47c12e028050f35324400c4dafe","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/commits/474ff5556f59c47c12e028050f35324400c4dafe","created_at":"2025-04-25T09:47:41Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"actor":{"login":"tsvallender","id":122306143,"node_id":"U_kgDOB0o-Xw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/122306143?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tsvallender","html_url":"https://github.com/tsvallender","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tsvallender/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tsvallender/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tsvallender/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tsvallender/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tsvallender/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tsvallender/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tsvallender/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tsvallender/events
