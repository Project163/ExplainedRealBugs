for contributing to Rails!\r\n\r\nPlease do not make *Draft* pull requests, as they still send\r\nnotifications to everyone watching the Rails repo.\r\n\r\nCreate a pull request when it is ready for review and feedback\r\nfrom the Rails team :).\r\n\r\nIf your pull request affects documentation or any non-code\r\nchanges, guidelines for those changes are [available\r\nhere](https://edgeguides.rubyonrails.org/contributing_to_ruby_on_rails.html#contributing-to-the-rails-documentation)\r\n\r\nAbout this template\r\n\r\nThe following template aims to help contributors write a good description for their pull requests.\r\nWe'd like you to provide a description of the changes in your pull request (i.e. bugs fixed or features added), the motivation behind the changes, and complete the checklist below before opening a pull request.\r\n\r\nFeel free to discard it if you need to (e.g. when you just fix a typo). -->\r\n\r\n### Motivation / Background\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nDescribe why this Pull Request needs to be merged. What bug have you fixed? What feature have you added? Why is it important?\r\nIf you are fixing a specific issue, include \"Fixes #ISSUE\" (replace with the issue number, remove the quotes) and the issue will be linked to this PR.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis Pull Request has been created because rails created PWA files for API only project which not very useful for API only project, fixes #52570.\r\n\r\n### Detail\r\n\r\nThis Pull Request changes remove PWA files and only generated routes for non API only project. \r\n\r\nI didn't find any tests related to this change. If you could tell me where I need to change the test or add a new test, happy to fix the test.\r\n\r\n### Additional information\r\n\r\n<!-- Provide additional information such as benchmarks, references to other repositories, or alternative solutions. -->\r\n\r\n### Checklist\r\n\r\nBefore submitting the PR make sure the following are checked:\r\n\r\n* [x] This Pull Request is related to one change. Unrelated changes should be opened in separate PRs.\r\n* [x] Commit message has a detailed description of what changed and why. If this PR fixes a related issue include it in the commit message. Ex: `[Fix #issue-number]`\r\n* [ ] Tests are added or updated if you fix a bug or add a feature.\r\n* [ ] CHANGELOG files are updated for the changed libraries if there is a behavior change or additional feature. Minor bug fixes and documentation changes should not be included.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/52571/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/52571/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":13842768767,"node_id":"CE_lADNIULOkp27488AAAADORfjfw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/events/13842768767","actor":{"login":"byroot","id":44640,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0NjQw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/44640?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/byroot","html_url":"https://github.com/byroot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/byroot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/byroot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/byroot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/byroot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/byroot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/byroot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/byroot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/byroot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/byroot/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2024-08-12T07:21:29Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":13842768835,"node_id":"CE_lADNIULOkp27488AAAADORfjww","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/events/13842768835","actor":{"login":"byroot","id":44640,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0NjQw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/44640?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/byroot","html_url":"https://github.com/byroot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/byroot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/byroot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/byroot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/byroot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/byroot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/byroot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/byroot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/byroot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/byroot/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":"a0b9ea4c978e907fb37e4e771009929bdeb17d26","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/commits/a0b9ea4c978e907fb37e4e771009929bdeb17d26","created_at":"2024-08-12T07:21:29Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":14510792096,"node_id":"REFE_lADNIULOkp27488AAAADYOkdoA","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/events/14510792096","actor":{"login":"DanielaVelasquez","id":15008564,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MDA4NTY0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15008564?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/DanielaVelasquez","html_url":"https://github.com/DanielaVelasquez","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DanielaVelasquez/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DanielaVelasquez/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DanielaVelasquez/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DanielaVelasquez/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DanielaVelasquez/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DanielaVelasquez/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DanielaVelasquez/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DanielaVelasquez/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DanielaVelasquez/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"c320a073d5a9a4be4d6944879ebabcd4f606a81b","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DanielaVelasquez/rails/commits/c320a073d5a9a4be4d6944879ebabcd4f606a81b","created_at":"2024-10-03T21:58:51Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
