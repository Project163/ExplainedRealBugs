I've come across an issue that I think is a bug, but could also be configuration not being used as intended.\r\n\r\nRails 7 config:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\n# config/application.rb\r\nconfig.logger = Logist::Logger.new($stdout)\r\nother_logger = AnotherLogger.new\r\n\r\nconfig.logger.extend(ActiveSupport::Logger.broadcast(other_logger))\r\n\r\nconfig.log_level = :info if Rails.env.production?\r\n```\r\n\r\nWith this config, `Rails.logger.debug` does nothing in production. 🟢 \r\n\r\nThe Rails 7 config relied on the private API described in https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/48615, so we have to refactor it for 7.1. 7.1/Edge Rails config:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\n# config/application.rb\r\nconfig.logger = Logist::Logger.new($stdout)\r\nother_logger = AnotherLogger.new\r\n\r\nconfig.logger = ActiveSupport::BroadcastLogger.new(config.logger, other_logger)\r\n\r\nconfig.log_level = :info if Rails.env.production?\r\n```\r\n\r\nWith this config, `Rails.logger.debug` logs in production. 🔴 \r\n\r\nI think the issue comes from https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/49721, since the `log_level` is no longer being assigned to the broadcast loggers. I would expect `config.log_level` to work for whatever you assign `config.logger` too, and if that's changing it seems like a breaking change to me.\r\n\r\nIs the expectation that if you use `BroadcastLogger`, you set the `level` manually on loggers?\r\n\r\ncc @Edouard-chin @andrewn617  @rafaelfranca \r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n**Rails version**: `main`\r\n\r\n**Ruby version**: 3.2\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"byroot","id":44640,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0NjQw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/44640?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/byroot","html_url":"https://github.com/byroot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/byroot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/byroot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/byroot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/byroot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/byroot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/byroot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/byroot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/byroot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/byroot/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/50324/reactions","total_count":4,"+1":4,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/50324/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
