Steps to reproduce\r\nIn Rails 6.0, create a query on a JSON/JSONB column in PostgreSQL using an array of hashes:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nstore_ids = [{ \"store_id\" => 7 }, { \"store_id\" => 8 }]\r\nwhere(dimensions: store_ids) # This works as expected in Rails 6.0\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen, run the same query in Rails 6.1:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nstore_ids = [{ \"store_id\" => 7 }, { \"store_id\" => 8 }]\r\nwhere(dimensions: store_ids) # This returns [] in Rails 6.1\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\nThe query should return the same results in Rails 6.1 as it did in Rails 6.0. The ActiveRecord should convert the array of hashes into a JSON representation that PostgreSQL can understand.\r\n\r\n### Actual behavior\r\nIn Rails 6.1, the query returns an empty array. It appears that ActiveRecord is no longer converting the array of hashes into a JSON representation that PostgreSQL can understand.\r\n\r\nAs a workaround, I've had to convert the store IDs into strings and use PostgreSQL's `->>` operator syntax:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nstore_ids = [7, 8].map(&:to_s)\r\nwhere(\"dimensions->>'store_id' in (?)\", store_ids) # This works as expected in Rails 6.1\r\n```\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n**Rails version**: 6.1\r\n\r\n**Ruby version**:

Motivation / Background\r\nThis PR addresses the issues #48535 and #48072.\r\n\r\nWith the introduction of PR #41068, an unintended behavior surfaced, causing the `proc_for_binds` to apply casting to attributes that were already casted. Consequently, this led to the malfunctioning of queries, as noted in the referenced issues.\r\n\r\nThis commit fixes the issue by replacing the type with `ActiveModel::Type.default_value` so that the 2nd serialization is effectively a no-op. This correction has obviated the need for changes such as \"Fix deterministic queries that were broken after #41068,\" as detailed in [this commit](https://github.com/wbotelhos/rails/commit/37361bfb4222c5d210f11e48ecee46b05ea7d50e). These changes had inadvertently caused the tests initially intended for `proc_for_binds` within `HomogeneousIn` to erroneously evaluate the `proc_for_binds` within `InWithAdditionalValues`. This resulted in false positives whenever adjustments were made to the `proc_for_binds` within `HomogeneousIn`.\r\n\r\nFixes #48072.\r\nFixes #48535.\r\n\r\n### Checklist\r\n\r\nBefore submitting the PR make sure the following are checked:\r\n\r\n* [x] This Pull Request is related to one change. Changes that are unrelated should be opened in separate PRs.\r\n* [x] Commit message has a detailed description of what changed and why. If this PR fixes a related issue include it in the commit message. Ex: `[Fix #issue-number]`\r\n* [x] Tests are added or updated if you fix a bug or add a feature.\r\n* [x] CHANGELOG files are updated for the changed libraries if there is a behavior change or additional feature. Minor bug fixes and documentation changes should not be included.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/49050/reactions","total_count":3,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":3,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/49050/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":10918192820,"node_id":"REFE_lADNIULOZHZl4M8AAAACisZmtA","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/events/10918192820","actor":{"login":"jonathanhefner","id":771968,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc3MTk2OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/771968?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonathanhefner","html_url":"https://github.com/jonathanhefner","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonathanhefner/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonathanhefner/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonathanhefner/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonathanhefner/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonathanhefner/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonathanhefner/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonathanhefner/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonathanhefner/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonathanhefner/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"fb5773b3e825b098fd6920c43342daea0251dd82","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/JohnAnon9771/rails/commits/fb5773b3e825b098fd6920c43342daea0251dd82","created_at":"2023-11-09T21:26:36Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":10918279854,"node_id":"CE_lADNIULOZHZl4M8AAAACise6rg","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/events/10918279854","actor":{"login":"jonathanhefner","id":771968,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc3MTk2OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/771968?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonathanhefner","html_url":"https://github.com/jonathanhefner","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonathanhefner/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonathanhefner/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonathanhefner/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonathanhefner/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonathanhefner/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonathanhefner/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonathanhefner/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonathanhefner/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonathanhefner/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2023-11-09T21:38:23Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":11140245537,"node_id":"REFE_lADNIULOZHZl4M8AAAACmAKoIQ","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/events/11140245537","actor":{"login":"catlee","id":54458,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0NDU4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/54458?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/catlee","html_url":"https://github.com/catlee","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/catlee/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/catlee/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/catlee/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/catlee/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/catlee/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/catlee/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/catlee/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/catlee/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/catlee/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"99af589c2209cf434ff85578a126821ebeb589e0","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Shopify/rails/commits/99af589c2209cf434ff85578a126821ebeb589e0","created_at":"2023-12-04T14:51:05Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":16620117087,"node_id":"REFE_lADNIULOZHZl4M8AAAAD3qLcXw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/events/16620117087","actor":{"login":"yoones","id":1333898,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMzM4OTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1333898?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yoones","html_url":"https://github.com/yoones","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yoones/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yoones/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yoones/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yoones/starred{/owner}{/repo}
