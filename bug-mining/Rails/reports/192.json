Here's how you'd manually emulate it:\n\n```\nclass Current < ActiveSupport::CurrentAttributes\n  attribute :has_permission_to, default: {}\nend\n```\n\nAnywhere really, but in my case this is a method in a model:\n```\ndef has_permission_to(access_type)\n  Current.has_permission_to.fetch access_type do |key|\n      Current.has_permission_to[key] = some_calculation\n  end\nend\n```\n\n### Expected behaviour\n\nSaving code anywhere in the application (triggering a Zeitwerk reload) should reload Current and reinitialise the default value of `Current.has_permission_to` which is an empty hash.\n\n### Actual behaviour\n\nThe first request after a code save (and Zeitwerk reload) where that request accesses the model method `has_permission_to(access_type)` triggers `undefined method 'fetch' for nil` indicating that the default value for `Current.has_permission_to` hasn't been set yet. Reloading the page succeeds and I'm not sure why.\n\n### System configuration\n\n**Rails version**:  `8.0.1`\n\n**Ruby version**: `3.3.7`\n","closed_by":{"login":"byroot","id":44640,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0NjQw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/44640?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/byroot","html_url":"https://github.com/byroot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/byroot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/byroot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/byroot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/byroot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/byroot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/byroot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/byroot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/byroot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/byroot/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/54636/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/54636/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
