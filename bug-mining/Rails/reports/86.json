We've identified the following as the reason why. This [commit](https://github.com/rails/rails/commit/2df70ddb96e7ab0a7c10e411e879ab3a2b1f4d84) changed `send(\"#{attribute}=\")` to use `write_attribute(attribute)` which seemingly ignores our setter.  Ideally we'd continue to call our method. \r\n\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n**Rails version**: 7.1\r\n\r\n**Ruby version**: 3.2.2\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"kamipo","id":12642,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNjQy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12642?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kamipo","html_url":"https://github.com/kamipo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kamipo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kamipo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kamipo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kamipo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kamipo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kamipo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kamipo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kamipo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kamipo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/49874/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/49874/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
