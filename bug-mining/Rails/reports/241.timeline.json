I do. I'm pointing out what I believe is a problem in the design from a design fundamentals perspective. It's surprising, causing friction, inconsistent, and it's a regression of behavior in a minor version release.\n\nIn our case we require railties before we require a common rails configuration. The common rails configuration varies the configuration it emits based on the railties that are enabled. It requires rails itself.\n\nWe didn't need to require `rails` ahead of time until 8.1.0 was released. We can \"work around\" this by changing the order of requires or requiring `rails` ahead of the railtie requires, but as I said, it was surprising and seemed like a defect, especially since Rails itself was internally inconsistent. \n\nIt looked like this:\n\n```\nrequire_relative \"boot\"\n\nrequire \"action_mailer/railtie\"\n\nrequire \"rails_application/development\"\n```\n\nFor us, it works to reorder those two requires... we don't actually have a temporal dependency because we don't check for ActionMailer being defined until rails initialization.

That is correct.\n\nNow, `<frameworks>/railtie` are special like you said. Some people thought they were entrypoints, and so far, they did work being entrypoints. Most of them are implemented as entrypoint (they require the top level file of the framework), and ergonomically I think they should do.\n\nI know what to do with the frameworks inside rails itself, since requiring the top level file of the framework would make it work, but for things like global_id or any other railtie it is hard to make that work since they can't require `active_support/rails`. So, the correct fix is to make the railtie require `rails` before requiring `rails/railtie`. I'll apply to globalid, but I'm sure other gems will not have similar problems.\n\nSo, the safe thing to do in your application is to add `require \"rails\"` before any railtie like we do in `config/application.rb`.\n\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/3433908316/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"rafaelfranca","id":47848,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3ODQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47848?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelfranca","html_url":"https://github.com/rafaelfranca","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelfranca/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelfranca/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelfranca/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelfranca/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelfranca/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelfranca/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelfranca/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelfranca/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelfranca/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/3433949611","html_url":"https://github.com/rails/rails/issues/55970#issuecomment-3433949611","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/55970","id":3433949611,"node_id":"IC_kwDNIULOzK3pqw","user":{"login":"rafaelfranca","id":47848,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3ODQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47848?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelfranca","html_url":"https://github.com/rafaelfranca","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelfranca/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelfranca/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelfranca/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelfranca/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelfranca/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelfranca/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelfranca/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelfranca/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelfranca/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-10-22T19:39:25Z","updated_at":"2025-10-22T19:39:25Z","body":"It is even hard to know what other engines/railties will do because the Rails generator itself don't have any of the requires.
