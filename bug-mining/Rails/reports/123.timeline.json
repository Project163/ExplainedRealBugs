Motivation / Background\r\n\r\nFixes #52098 \r\n\r\nThis Pull Request has been created because I encountered surprising behavior when upgrading a Rails 7 application to Rails 7.1.  In `config/initializers/new_frame_defaults_7_1.rb`, I had\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nRails.application.config.active_record.run_after_transaction_callbacks_in_order_defined = true\r\n```\r\n\r\nbut I was surprised to find that when the application booted\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nActiveRecord.run_after_transaction_callbacks_in_order_defined\r\n=> false\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Detail\r\n\r\nThis Pull Request changes the name of a local variable in the ActiveRecord Railtie's `active_record.set_configs` initializer.  The name change avoids shadowing the `configs` and resetting the local variable that is initialized at the beginning of the initializer.  This way the `after_initialize` hook can run through _all_ of the config values set in `Rails.application.config.active_record` and configure `ActiveRecord` accordingly.\r\n\r\n### Additional information\r\n\r\nI am not certain whether the variable shadowing and resetting was indeed intentional.  It may have been and this solution may introduce other problems 😬 .\r\n\r\nI think this problem only occurs when ActiveRecord happens to be loaded before the `new_framework_defaults` initializer runs.  I would guess that many gems might load ActiveRecord and gem Railties run before files in `config/initializers`.  That is to say that I would guess that loading ActiveRecord in a gem could be fairly commonplace.  Solving such problems may not fall under the domain of Rails, but I figured I would give this PR a try 😃 .\r\n\r\n### Checklist\r\n\r\nBefore submitting the PR make sure the following are checked:\r\n\r\n* [x] This Pull Request is related to one change. Unrelated changes should be opened in separate PRs.\r\n* [x] Commit message has a detailed description of what changed and why. If this PR fixes a related issue include it in the commit message. Ex: `[Fix #issue-number]`\r\n* [x] Tests are added or updated if you fix a bug or add a feature.\r\n* [x] CHANGELOG files are updated for the changed libraries if there is a behavior change or additional feature. Minor bug fixes and documentation changes should not be included.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/52100/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":1,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/52100/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":13136629390,"node_id":"CE_lADNIULOi-6lGM8AAAADDwEOjg","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/events/13136629390","actor":{"login":"rafaelfranca","id":47848,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3ODQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47848?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelfranca","html_url":"https://github.com/rafaelfranca","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelfranca/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelfranca/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelfranca/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelfranca/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelfranca/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelfranca/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelfranca/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelfranca/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelfranca/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2024-06-12T19:44:36Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":13417923992,"node_id":"REFE_lADNIULOi-6lGM8AAAADH8VFmA","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/events/13417923992","actor":{"login":"Set2005","id":209831,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwOTgzMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/209831?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Set2005","html_url":"https://github.com/Set2005","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Set2005/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Set2005/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Set2005/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Set2005/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Set2005/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Set2005/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Set2005/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Set2005/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Set2005/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"1dce699e4e37804c476388efae8c8d4f6c607d2d","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Set2005/fix-association-initialize-order/commits/1dce699e4e37804c476388efae8c8d4f6c607d2d","created_at":"2024-07-08T05:31:30Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":14510790938,"node_id":"REFE_lADNIULOi-6lGM8AAAADYOkZGg","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/events/14510790938","actor":{"login":"DanielaVelasquez","id":15008564,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MDA4NTY0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15008564?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/DanielaVelasquez","html_url":"https://github.com/DanielaVelasquez","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DanielaVelasquez/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DanielaVelasquez/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DanielaVelasquez/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DanielaVelasquez/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DanielaVelasquez/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DanielaVelasquez/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DanielaVelasquez/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DanielaVelasquez/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DanielaVelasquez/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"fddfa63c02790fc89255be1a1b80b4850727d0c1","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DanielaVelasquez/rails/commits/fddfa63c02790fc89255be1a1b80b4850727d0c1","created_at":"2024-10-03T21:58:42Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/2610188902","html_url":"https://github.com/rails/rails/issues/52098#issuecomment-2610188902","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/52098","id":2610188902,"node_id":"IC_kwDNIULOm5RSZg","user":{"login":"TomNaessens","id":915130,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkxNTEzMA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/915130?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/TomNaessens","html_url":"https://github.com/TomNaessens","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TomNaessens/followers","following_url":"
