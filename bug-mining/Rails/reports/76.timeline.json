Motivation / Background\r\n\r\nWhen the `webdrivers` gem is not present (which is the default scenario in Rails 7.1+), the Selenium `driver_path` starts out as `nil`. This means the driver is located lazily, and deferred until a system test is run.\r\n\r\nIf parallel testing is used, this leads to a race condition, where each worker process tries to resolve the driver simultaneously. The result is an error as described in #49906.\r\n\r\n### Detail\r\n\r\nThis commit fixes the race condition by changing the implementation of `Browser#preload`. The previous implementation worked when `driver_path` was set to a Proc by the `webdrivers` gem, but doesn't work when the `webdrivers` gem is not being used and the `driver_path` is `nil`.\r\n\r\nIf the `driver_path` is `nil`, `Browser#preload` will now use the `DriverFinder` utility provided by the `selenium-webdriver` gem to eagerly resolve the driver path. This ensures that `driver_path` is set before parallel test workers are forked.\r\n\r\nFixes #49906.\r\n\r\n### Additional information\r\n\r\nThis solution mimics the code within Selenium that determines the driver executable on demand:\r\n\r\n```\r\nservice.executable_path ||= WebDriver::DriverFinder.path(options, service.class)\r\n```\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/blob/7680b7cf25579217cb62a0893c4b2b69c0186062/rb/lib/selenium/webdriver/common/local_driver.rb#L41\r\n\r\n### Checklist\r\n\r\nBefore submitting the PR make sure the following are checked:\r\n\r\n* [x] This Pull Request is related to one change. Changes that are unrelated should be opened in separate PRs.\r\n* [x] Commit message has a detailed description of what changed and why. If this PR fixes a related issue include it in the commit message. Ex: `[Fix #issue-number]`\r\n* [x] Tests are added or updated if you fix a bug or add a feature.\r\n* [x] CHANGELOG files are updated for the changed libraries if there is a behavior change or additional feature. Minor bug fixes and documentation changes should not be included.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/49908/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/49908/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":10860596578,"node_id":"REFE_lADNIULOddO2088AAAACh1eNYg","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/events/10860596578","actor":{"login":"mattbrictson","id":189693,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4OTY5Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/189693?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattbrictson","html_url":"https://github.com/mattbrictson","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattbrictson/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattbrictson/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattbrictson/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattbrictson/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattbrictson/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattbrictson/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattbrictson/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattbrictson/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattbrictson/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"f60821b481600e0c4b7092f831d3e32b05467b10","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mattbrictson/rails/commits/f60821b481600e0c4b7092f831d3e32b05467b10","created_at":"2023-11-03T21:13:10Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":10860658629,"node_id":"REFE_lADNIULOddO2088AAAACh1h_xQ","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/events/10860658629","actor":{"login":"mattbrictson","id":189693,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4OTY5Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/189693?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattbrictson","html_url":"https://github.com/mattbrictson","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattbrictson/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattbrictson/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattbrictson/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattbrictson/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattbrictson/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattbrictson/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattbrictson/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattbrictson/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattbrictson/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"1c1da2c646ef39133339e1940493fea0778d4ca5","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mattbrictson/rails/commits/1c1da2c646ef39133339e1940493fea0778d4ca5","created_at":"2023-11-03T21:23:15Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":10860905344,"node_id":"LE_lADNIULOddO2088AAAACh1xDgA","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/events/10860905344","actor":{"login":"paulreece","id":96156234,"node_id":"U_kgDOBbs6Sg","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/96156234?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulreece","html_url":"https://github.com/paulreece","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulreece/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulreece/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulreece/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulreece/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulreece/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulreece/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulreece/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulreece/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulreece/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2023-11-03T22:10:47Z","label":{"name":"actionpack","color":"FFF700"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":10860906064,"node_id":"LE_lADNIULOddO2088AAAACh1xGUA","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/events/10860906064","actor":{"login":"paulreece","id":96156234,"node_id":"U_kgDOBbs6Sg","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/96156234?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulreece","html_url":"https://github.com/paulreece","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulreece/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulreece/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulreece/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/us
