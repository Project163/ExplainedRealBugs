pull request Deprecate the `validate: false` option for `foreign_key` and `check_constraint`.\r\n\r\n### Motivation / Background\r\n\r\nThe `foreign_key` and `check_constraint` with `validate: false` option actually create valid constraints\r\nbecause PostgreSQL ignores `NOT VALID` option in `CREATE TABLE` statements.\r\n    \r\nTo enable the `NOT VALID` option, use `add_foreign_key` or `add_check_constraint`, which generate `ALTER TABLE` statements.\r\n    \r\n### Detail\r\nHere are the example of check constraints.\r\n\r\n- `check_constraint` with `validate: false` option creates a valid check constraint\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\ncreate_table :posts, force: true do |t|\r\n  t.check_constraint \"id > 0\", name: \"foo\", validate: false\r\nend\r\n```\r\n\r\n```sql\r\nCREATE TABLE \"posts\" (\"id\" bigserial primary key, CONSTRAINT foo CHECK (id > 0) NOT VALID);\r\nSELECT conname, convalidated FROM pg_constraint WHERE contype = 'c' AND conname = 'foo';\r\n\r\n/*\r\n conname | convalidated\r\n---------+--------------\r\n foo     | t\r\n(1 row)\r\n*/\r\n```\r\n\r\n- `add_check_constraint` with `validate: false` option creates a invalid check constraint\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\ncreate_table :posts, force: true do |t|\r\nend\r\nadd_check_constraint :posts, \"id > 0\", name: \"foo\", validate: false\r\n```\r\n\r\n```sql\r\nCREATE TABLE \"posts\" (\"id\" bigserial primary key);\r\nALTER TABLE \"posts\" ADD CONSTRAINT foo CHECK (id > 0) NOT VALID;\r\nSELECT conname, convalidated FROM pg_constraint WHERE contype = 'c' AND conname = 'foo';\r\n/*\r\n conname | convalidated\r\n---------+--------------\r\n foo     | f\r\n(1 row)\r\n*/\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Additional information\r\nRelated to #53732\r\n\r\nRefer to the following discussion at pgsql-hackers mailing list. https://www.postgresql.org/message-id/202412050936.bse4z5tbmze6%40alvherre.pgsql\r\n\r\n> Maybe it would have been wise to forbid NOT VALID when used with CREATE\r\n> TABLE.  But we didn't.  Should we do that now?  Maybe we can just\r\n> document that you can specify it but it doesn't do anything.\r\n\r\n### Checklist\r\n\r\nBefore submitting the PR make sure the following are checked:\r\n\r\n* [x] This Pull Request is related to one change. Unrelated changes should be opened in separate PRs.\r\n* [x] Commit message has a detailed description of what changed and why. If this PR fixes a related issue include it in the commit message.
