Create a new Rails app with `rails new ...`\r\n2. Create a controller (in this example, `hello`)\r\n3. Type the following code in the action:\r\n```ruby\r\nclass HelloController < ApplicationController\r\n  def index\r\n    raise SyntaxError, \"Some error\"\r\n  end\r\nend\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\nRails should show the normal red error screen with the syntax error, and a stacktrace pointing to `app/controllers/hello:3`\r\n\r\n### Actual behavior\r\nIt shows a Puma generic (blank) error screen with the following message:\r\n\r\n```\r\nPuma caught this error: undefined method `start_with?' for nil (NoMethodError)\r\n/home/mauricio/.asdf/installs/ruby/3.3.1/lib/ruby/gems/3.3.0/gems/activesupport-7.1.3.4/lib/active_support/syntax_error_proxy.rb:62:in `source_location_eval?'\r\n/home/mauricio/.asdf/installs/ruby/3.3.1/lib/ruby/gems/3.3.0/gems/activesupport-7.1.3.4/lib/active_support/syntax_error_proxy.rb:48:in `parse_message_for_trace'\r\n/home/mauricio/.asdf/installs/ruby/3.3.1/lib/ruby/gems/3.3.0/gems/activesupport-7.1.3.4/lib/active_support/syntax_error_proxy.rb:37:in `backtrace_locations'\r\n... only framework trace from now on ...\r\n```\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n**Rails version**: 7.1.3.4\r\n**Ruby version**: 3.3.1\r\n\r\n### Additional info\r\n\r\nDebugging this issue landed me at the `active_support/syntax_error_proxy.rb` file. Just right at the end there's this code:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\n      if SyntaxError.method_defined?(:path) # Ruby 3.3+\r\n        def source_location_eval?\r\n          __getobj__.path.start_with?(\"(eval\")\r\n        end\r\n      else # 3.2 and older versions of Ruby\r\n        def source_location_eval?\r\n          __getobj__.to_s.start_with?(\"(eval\")\r\n        end\r\n      end\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe problem is the line `__getobj__.path.start_with?(\"(eval\")` - because `SyntaxError#path` can be `nil` in certain circumstances, this causes an error in treating the stacktrace (so that it can be rendered in the Rails app). I found this error while debugging an issue using Dry::Schema - it seems that for some invalid DSL they raise a `SyntaxError` and that causes the issue.","closed_by":{"login":"rafaelfranca","id":47848,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3ODQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47848?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelfranca","html_url":"https://github.com/rafaelfranca","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelfranca/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelfranca/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelfranca/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelfranca/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelfranca/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelfranca/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelfranca/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelfranca/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelfranca/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/52089/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":2},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/52089/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
