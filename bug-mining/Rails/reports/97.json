Generate a new rails app with the flag `--skip-test`, or comment out `require \"rails/test_unit/railtie\"` in an existing app's `application.rb` to disable the test framework.\r\n2. Run `bin/rails --tasks` ~(or `bin/rake --tasks`)~\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\nRails outputs a list of available tasks.\r\n\r\n### Actual behavior\r\nRails outputs `Unrecognized command \"default\" (Rails::Command::UnrecognizedCommandError)`\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n**Rails version**: 7.1.2\r\n\r\n**Ruby version**: 3.2\r\n\r\n### Details\r\nHere's the sequence that leads to the bug as I understand it:\r\n1. Rake is invoked without a valid task name so its `top_level_tasks` [only contains the default task](https://github.com/ruby/rake/blob/a7ad109522d38b39024d6dd6b0def75e0eaedf46/lib/rake/application.rb#L791).\r\n2. In Rails, the [default task is set](https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/c66b655bf8948622722c24e6455b9b41febbe3a6/railties/lib/rails/test_unit/testing.rake#L6) in a file loaded by `rails/test_unit/railtie`, which doesn't get loaded if tests are skipped.\r\n3. Rails [raises an UnrecognizedCommandError](https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/c66b655bf8948622722c24e6455b9b41febbe3a6/railties/lib/rails/commands/rake/rake_command.rb#L23) before rake has a chance to [print the list of tasks](https://github.com/ruby/rake/blob/a7ad109522d38b39024d6dd6b0def75e0eaedf46/lib/rake/application.rb#L134).\r\n\r\n### Workaround\r\nAdd the line `task :default` to a .rake file to set an empty default task.","closed_by":{"login":"jonathanhefner","id":771968,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc3MTk2OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/771968?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonathanhefner","html_url":"https://github.com/jonathanhefner","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonathanhefner/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonathanhefner/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonathanhefner/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonathanhefner/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonathanhefner/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonathanhefner/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonathanhefner/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonathanhefner/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonathanhefner/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/50700/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/50700/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
