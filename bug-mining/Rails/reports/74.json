I don't know if this issue is in that category and is an expected shortcoming of `normalizes`, or if this should work and doesn't. Discovered the issue running inside a caching block, but attempted to distill down minimally in case below.\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\nAttempt to cache or just `Marshal.dump` an AR object using `normalizes`. Example:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\n# frozen_string_literal: true\r\n\r\nrequire \"bundler/inline\"\r\n\r\ngemfile(true) do\r\n  source \"https://rubygems.org\"\r\n\r\n  git_source(:github) { |repo| \"https://github.com/#{repo}.git\" }\r\n\r\n  gem \"rails\", github: \"rails/rails\", branch: \"main\"\r\n  gem \"sqlite3\"\r\nend\r\n\r\nrequire \"active_record\"\r\nrequire \"minitest/autorun\"\r\nrequire \"logger\"\r\n\r\n# This connection will do for database-independent bug reports.\r\nActiveRecord::Base.establish_connection(adapter: \"sqlite3\", database: \":memory:\")\r\nActiveRecord::Base.logger = Logger.new(STDOUT)\r\n\r\nActiveRecord::Schema.define do\r\n  create_table :users, force: true do |t|\r\n    t.string :name\r\n  end\r\nend\r\n\r\nclass User < ActiveRecord::Base\r\n  normalizes :name, with: -> { _1.strip.downcase }\r\nend\r\n\r\nclass BugTest < Minitest::Test\r\n  def test_caching_normalized_record\r\n    user = User.create(name: \"First Name    \")\r\n\r\n    assert_equal \"first name\", user.name\r\n    assert_equal user.inspect, Marshal.load(Marshal.dump(user)).inspect\r\n  end\r\nend\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\n\r\nUsing `normalizes` should manipulate values when set, and not impact caching/dumping the object.\r\n\r\n### Actual behavior\r\n\r\nWhen `normalizes` is in use, an error is thrown:\r\n\r\n> TypeError: no _dump_data is defined for class Proc\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n**Rails version**: 7.1 and/or `main` branch\r\n\r\n**Ruby version**: 3.2.2\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"jonathanhefner","id":771968,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc3MTk2OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/771968?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonathanhefner","html_url":"https://github.com/jonathanhefner","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonathanhefner/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonathanhefner/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonathanhefner/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonathanhefner/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonathanhefner/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonathanhefner/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonathanhefner/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonathanhefner/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonathanhefner/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/49871/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":2,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/49871/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
