Motivation / Background\r\n\r\nFixes #54529\r\n\r\nSome Rails installers (like Active Storage and Action Text) create tables with plural names regardless of the `pluralize_table_names` setting. This can cause confusion for users who have set `pluralize_table_names` to `false` expecting all table names to be singular. This PR adds documentation to clearly warn users about this limitation and the necessary manual steps they need to take.\r\n\r\n### Detail\r\n\r\nThis Pull Request adds a warning note in the `config.active_record.pluralize_table_names` section of the configuration guide (`guides/source/configuring.md`).\r\n\r\n### Additional information\r\n\r\nRelated discussions:\r\n- Active Storage plural tables: #52970\r\n- Action Text plural tables: #54529\r\n\r\n### Checklist\r\n\r\nBefore submitting the PR make sure the following are checked:\r\n\r\n* [x] This Pull Request is related to one change. Unrelated changes should be opened in separate PRs.\r\n* [x] Commit message has a detailed description of what changed and why. \r\n* [x] Tests are added or updated if you fix a bug or add a feature.\r\n* [x] CHANGELOG files are updated for the changed libraries if there is a behavior change or additional feature.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/54649/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/54649/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":16657349470,"node_id":"CE_lADNIULOqg6wSM8AAAAD4Nr7Xg","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/events/16657349470","actor":{"login":"Edouard-chin","id":8122246,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxMjIyNDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8122246?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Edouard-chin","html_url":"https://github.com/Edouard-chin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Edouard-chin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Edouard-chin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Edouard-chin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Edouard-chin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Edouard-chin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Edouard-chin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Edouard-chin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Edouard-chin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Edouard-chin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2025-03-10T15:45:09Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":16657349512,"node_id":"CE_lADNIULOqg6wSM8AAAAD4Nr7iA","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/events/16657349512","actor":{"login":"Edouard-chin","id":8122246,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxMjIyNDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8122246?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Edouard-chin","html_url":"https://github.com/Edouard-chin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Edouard-chin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Edouard-chin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Edouard-chin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Edouard-chin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Edouard-chin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Edouard-chin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Edouard-chin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Edouard-chin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Edouard-chin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":"43efe464a52e9f1c9259e6a90c4da9a9163bd762","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/commits/43efe464a52e9f1c9259e6a90c4da9a9163bd762","created_at":"2025-03-10T15:45:10Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
