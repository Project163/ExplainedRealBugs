Generate an app using `rails new` with Rails 7.1.0.beta1\r\n2. Run `RAILS_ENV=production bundle exec puma -C ./config/puma.rb`\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\n\r\nPuma should start.\r\n\r\n### Actual behavior\r\n\r\n```\r\n./config/puma.rb:16:in `block in _load_from': uninitialized constant Puma::DSL::Concurrent (NameError)\r\n\tfrom ./config/puma.rb:16:in `fetch'\r\n\tfrom ./config/puma.rb:16:in `_load_from'\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe problem lies in the `config/puma.rb` file generated by `rails new`, specifically this statement that was added in #46838:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nENV.fetch(\"WEB_CONCURRENCY\") { Concurrent.physical_processor_count }\r\n```\r\n\r\nAt the time Puma evals this statement, `Bundler.require` has not yet been run, and so the `concurrent-ruby` gem has not yet been loaded. That is why the `Concurrent` constant is not defined and we see an `uninitialized constant` error when Puma starts.\r\n\r\n### Workaround\r\n\r\nSet the `WEB_CONCURRENCY` env var or change the `ENV.fetch` statement `config/puma.rb` as follows:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nENV.fetch(\"WEB_CONCURRENCY\") do\r\n  require \"concurrent-ruby\"\r\n  Concurrent.physical_processor_count\r\nend\r\n```\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\n**Rails version**: 7.1.0.beta1\r\n\r\n**Ruby version**: 3.2.2 (2023-03-30 revision e51014f9c0) [x86_64-darwin22]\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"guilleiguaran","id":160941,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MDk0MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/160941?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/guilleiguaran","html_url":"https://github.com/guilleiguaran","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guilleiguaran/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guilleiguaran/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guilleiguaran/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guilleiguaran/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guilleiguaran/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guilleiguaran/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guilleiguaran/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guilleiguaran/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guilleiguaran/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/49323/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/49323/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
