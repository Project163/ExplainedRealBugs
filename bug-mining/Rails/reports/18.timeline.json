Motivation / Background\r\n\r\nCloses https://github.com/rails/rails/issues/47343\r\n\r\nI have found inconsistent behaviour with `SafeBuffer`'s `slice`, `chr`, and `[]` functions.\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nbuffer = ActiveSupport::SafeBuffer.new\r\nbuffer.concat(\"<html>\")\r\n\r\nbuffer[0..0].html_safe? # true\r\nbuffer.slice(0, 1).html_safe? # false\r\n\r\nbuffer[0].html_safe? # true\r\nbuffer.chr.html_safe? # false\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis behaviour was introduced in this [PR](https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/33808), and this has been included in Rails 6.0.0.\r\nAlso, the behaviour of persistently keeping the `html_safe` flag from the `[]` function was introduced in this [commit](https://github.com/rails/rails/commit/8ccaa34103f1c37f7549f7f6c47a21dba21624db) from 2012.  \r\n\r\n### Detail\r\n\r\nSince `String#slice` is an alias method of `String#[]`, I believe `SafeBuffer`'s `slice` and `[]` functions should also have the same parity. \r\n\r\n### Checklist\r\n\r\nBefore submitting the PR make sure the following are checked:\r\n\r\n* [x] This Pull Request is related to one change. Changes that are unrelated should be opened in separate PRs.\r\n* [x] Commit message has a detailed description of what changed and why. If this PR fixes a related issue include it in the commit message. Ex: `[Fix #issue-number]`\r\n* [x] Tests are added or updated if you fix a bug or add a feature.\r\n* [x] CHANGELOG files are updated for the changed libraries if there is a behavior change or additional feature. Minor bug fixes and documentation changes should not be included.\r\n\r\ncc @flavorjones

opening this issue to start a conversation about whether the current html-safety behavior of `ActiveSupport::SafeBuffer` should be considered incorrect or insecure and should be changed.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Context\r\n\r\nThe current (edge) behavior of the `ActiveSupport::SafeBuffer#html_safe?` attribute is to _preserve_ that attribute's value when the string is sliced with many methods:\r\n\r\n``` ruby\r\nstring = \"<div>test</div>\".html_safe\r\n\r\nstring[0..1].html_safe? # => true\r\nstring.slice(0, 1).html_safe? # => true\r\nstring.slice!(0, 1).html_safe? # => true\r\nstring.chr.html_safe? # => true\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis behavior was originally introduced for `#[]` with 2 arguments in 8ccaa341 (Rails 3.2.2), later extended in https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/33808 (Rails 6.0) to any number of arguments, and was later extended again to include `#slice`, `#slice!`, and `#chr` in https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/47344 (Rails 7.1.0.alpha).\r\n\r\n_Note: edited the above section on 2023-02-11 to reflect the first commit to support preserving html-safe in a slice-like method was 8ccaa341_\r\n\r\n## Problem\r\n\r\n[About a year ago](https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/33808#issuecomment-1044647597) I thought the current behavior was fine; but I've learned some painful lessons about sanitization since then and have changed my mind.\r\n\r\nSubstrings of an HTML-safe string are not themselves safe. Prior decisions supporting this statement:\r\n\r\n- 1300c034 (2011) which originally introduced the \"unsafe\" list to ensure `#gsub`, `#chop`, `#chomp`, `#delete`, etc. (and their bang methods) do not return safe buffers\r\n- https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/33990 which applied this \"unsafe\" policy to new Ruby methods `#delete_prefix` and `#delete_suffix`.\r\n\r\nHopefully it's obvious that slice methods like `#[]` and `#slice` can be used to implement the existing unsafe methods, and are therefore equivalent, which means _at best_ SafeBuffer is still inconsistent:\r\n\r\n``` ruby\r\noriginal = \"abcdefghi\".html_safe\r\n\r\noriginal.delete_prefix(\"abc\").tap do |subject|\r\n  subject # => \"defghi\"\r\n  subject.html_safe? # => false\r\nend\r\n\r\noriginal.slice(3..).tap do |subject|\r\n  subject # => \"defghi\"\r\n  subject.html_safe? # => true\r\nend\r\n```\r\n\r\nHere's a contrived example showing that it's possible to construct unsafe strings that are marked \"html safe\" using nothing but a source \"html safe\" string:\r\n\r\n``` ruby\r\nsafe = \"<span>title (critic 1)</span>\".html_safe\r\n\r\n# methods like append do the right thing with unsafe strings, HTML-escapes them\r\nsubject = safe + \"<\" # => \"<span>title (critic 1)</span>&lt;\"\r\nsubject.html_safe? # => true\r\n\r\nsubject = safe + \"<script>alert(1)</script>\" # => \"<span>title (critic 1)</span>&lt;script&gt;alert(1)&lt;/script&gt;\"\r\nsubject.html_safe? # => true\r\n\r\n# but slicing gets around this because it returns strings marked \"safe\"\r\nsubject = safe + safe[0] # => \"<span>title (critic 1)</span><\"\r\nsubject.html_safe? # => true\r\n\r\n# in the absurd extreme\r\nsubject = safe +\r\n          safe[0] + safe[1] + safe[13] + safe[14] + safe[15] + safe[2] + safe[6] + safe[5] +\r\n          safe[3] + safe[9] + safe[10] + safe[14] + safe[6] + safe[12] + safe[20] + safe[21] +\r\n          safe[0] + safe[23] + safe[1] + safe[13] + safe[14] + safe[15] + safe[2] + safe[6] + safe[5]\r\nsubject # => \"<span>title (critic 1)</span><script>alert(1)</script>\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nHere's a much more realistic example that uses the Rails sanitizer and takes advantage of comments being unescaped by HTML parsers:\r\n\r\n``` ruby\r\nclass ViewSanitizer\r\n  include ActionView::Helpers::SanitizeHelper\r\nend\r\n\r\ntags = [\"comment\", \"div\"] # a departure from the default, we'll let comments through\r\noriginal = ViewSanitizer.new.sanitize(\"<div><!-- <script>alert(1)</script> --></div>\", tags: tags)\r\n\r\noriginal # => \"<div><!-- <script>alert(1)</script> --></div>\"\r\noriginal.html_safe? # => true\r\n\r\nsubject = original[10..34] # => \"<script>alert(1)</script>\"\r\nsubject.html_safe? # => true\r\n```\r\n\r\nI would like to note that I commented in https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/33808#issuecomment-1044647597:\r\n\r\n> If you are able to generate a string that, once it's been sanitized and marked safe, would have a\r\n> malicious substring in it, please open an issue so we can discuss?\r\n\r\nThe previous example _is_ that case, and @SampsonCrowley was right that it's probably dangerous to allow this behavior to remain. Also, @ggmichaelgo was right in https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/46259 when he tried to revert #33808.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Short-term suggestion\r\n\r\nI think we need to revert the changes from https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/47344 and https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/33808.\r\n\r\nI'll prepare a PR for folks to review.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Longer-term suggestion\r\n\r\nI think there is a problem with the design used in `SafeBuffer`, which is an [\"unsafe list\"](https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/c88ca3b72083449fd242ed5aaf1b557f88a9e7b2/activesupport/lib/active_support/core_ext/string/output_safety.rb#L20) that names the methods which are unsafe.\r\n\r\nIn the past, this approach has required additional action by Rails maintainers when new unsafe string methods are introduced upstream -- see https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/33990 for an example to make sure `#delete_prefix!` marked the string as unsafe.\r\n\r\nI think a better approach might be to redesign this class to:\r\n\r\n1. avoid exclude lists\r\n2. convert the string to unsafe upon _any_ bang method being invoked\r\n\r\nMy suspicion is that we don't even need an exclude list -- methods like `String#capitalize` will return a new object which will be, by default, `html_safe? == false` (with the exception of empty strings). This assumption will greatly simplify the code.\r\n\r\nI'll schedule some time to work on this in the future.\r\n\r\n## Resources\r\n\r\nRelevant commits / issues / PRs:\r\n\r\n- https://github.com/rails/rails/commit/8ccaa34103f1c37f7549f7f6c47a21dba21624db\r\n- https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/33808\r\n- https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/33990\r\n- https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/46259\r\n- https://github.com/rails/rails/issues/47343\r\n- https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/47344","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/47361/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":1},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/47361/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
