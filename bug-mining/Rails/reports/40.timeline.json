Note that the concept of `html_safe` was not introduced until 94159359 (2009-10-08).\r\n\r\nA reasonable conclusion might be that the decision to preserve the `html_safe` property was not an intentional one, but the existing behavior from 2009 has simply been preserved going forward. There have been quite a few inconsistencies like this raised or fixed in the past few years, see #47361 for a discussion and some links to prior issues and PRs.\r\n\r\nI think it would be appropriate to update the behavior of this method to always return an `html_safe` string, but I'm interested in hearing what the Rails committers think. cc @jhawthorn and @matthewd who have chatted with me about html safety in the past.","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/1555930373/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"flavorjones","id":8207,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgyMDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8207?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/flavorjones","html_url":"https://github.com/flavorjones","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/flavorjones/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/flavorjones/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/flavorjones/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/flavorjones/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/flavorjones/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/flavorjones/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/flavorjones/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/flavorjones/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/flavorjones/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":9294590186,"node_id":"MEE_lADNIULOZmN9xM8AAAACKgAw6g","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/events/9294590186","actor":{"login":"matthewd","id":1034,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMzQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1034?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthewd","html_url":"https://github.com/matthewd","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthewd/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthewd/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthewd/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthewd/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthewd/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthewd/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthewd/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthewd/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthewd/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2023-05-20T14:59:07Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":9294590188,"node_id":"SE_lADNIULOZmN9xM8AAAACKgAw7A","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/events/9294590188","actor":{"login":"matthewd","id":1034,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMzQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1034?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthewd","html_url":"https://github.com/matthewd","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthewd/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthewd/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthewd/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthewd/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthewd/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthewd/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthewd/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthewd/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthewd/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2023-05-20T14:59:07Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":9294590193,"node_id":"MEE_lADNIULOZmN9xM8AAAACKgAw8Q","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/events/9294590193","actor":{"login":"jhawthorn","id":131752,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMTc1Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/131752?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhawthorn","html_url":"https://github.com/jhawthorn","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhawthorn/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhawthorn/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhawthorn/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhawthorn/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhawthorn/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhawthorn/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhawthorn/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhawthorn/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhawthorn/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2023-05-20T14:59:07Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":9294590197,"node_id":"SE_lADNIULOZmN9xM8AAAACKgAw9Q","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/events/9294590197","actor":{"login":"jhawthorn","id"

Motivation / Background\r\n\r\nThis PR updates the behavior of `ERB::Util.html_escape_once` to always return an `html_safe` string.\r\n\r\nThis method previously maintained the `html_safe?` property of a string on the return value. Because this string has been escaped, however, not marking it as `html_safe` causes entities to be double-escaped.\r\n\r\nAs an example, take this view snippet:\r\n\r\n  ```html\r\n  <p><%= html_escape_once(\"this & that &amp; the other\") %></p>\r\n  ```\r\n\r\nBefore this change, that would be double-escaped and render as:\r\n\r\n  ```html\r\n  <p>this &amp;amp; that &amp;amp; the other</p>\r\n  ```\r\n\r\nAfter this change, it renders correctly as:\r\n\r\n  ```html\r\n  <p>this &amp; that &amp; the other</p>\r\n  ```\r\n\r\nFixes #48256\r\n\r\n\r\n### Checklist\r\n\r\nBefore submitting the PR make sure the following are checked:\r\n\r\n* [x] This Pull Request is related to one change. Changes that are unrelated should be opened in separate PRs.\r\n* [x] Commit message has a detailed description of what changed and why. If this PR fixes a related issue include it in the commit message. Ex: `[Fix #issue-number]`\r\n* [x] Tests are added or updated if you fix a bug or add a feature.\r\n* [x] CHANGELOG files are updated for the changed libraries if there is a behavior change or additional feature. Minor bug fixes and documentation changes should not be included.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/48265/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":1,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/48265/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/1555958493","html_url":"https://github.com/rails/rails/issues/48256#issuecomment-1555958493","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/48256","id":1555958493,"node_id":"IC_kwDNIULOXL4K3Q","user":{"login":"flavorjones","id":8207,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgyMDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8207?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/flavorjones","html_url":"https://github.com/flavorjones","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/flavorjones/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/flavorjones/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/flavorjones/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/flavorjones/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/flavorjones/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/flavorjones/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/flavorjones/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/flavorjones/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/flavorjones/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-05-20T17:35:46Z","updated_at":"2023-05-20T17:35:46Z","body":"I've
