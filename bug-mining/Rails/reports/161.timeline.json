Motivation / Background\r\n\r\nAs requested by @AmandaPerino, this PR aims to improve the accessibility of the guides. It continues on the work in #51341 #51372 #51385 and #51444. It also addresses whatever wasn't addressed from https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/51341#issuecomment-2007717282.\r\n\r\n### Detail\r\n\r\nEach commit in the PR has a descriptive title and often a message why the change was made, which I recommend we keep when merging instead of squashing it. Screenshots are listed below. A few of the commits that introduce fixes or features are listed here:\r\n\r\n* [Add label and accessible content](https://github.com/rails/rails/commit/4f2b25ba54d82bc897fb33f681214f5bf05cb0bd) \r\n  \r\n  Having a select element without a label outside a form isn't directly problematic, but the text Version is the label of the select and should act as such.\r\n\r\n  Because the select element is set up to browse to a different page which loses the current focus position, users must be instructed about this context change. It would be much better to display this content to everyone, but having this for screenreaders only is better than not having it at all.\r\n\r\n* [Fix accessible text for voice commands](https://github.com/rails/rails/commit/1863e5590cecac6ecfd0c4c031f1c4c967d0d768) \r\n  \r\n  Using the title attribute means some screenreaders will not be able to show the expanded accessible text at all, but using aria-label loses the hover text currently available.\r\n\r\n  If the title attribute is still used, the accessible label should start with the same content as the visible label. This is necessary for most voice operated tooling which only match starting text.\r\n\r\n  Having \"Return\" as the start of the accessible label and \"Guides\" as the start of the visible label means in most cases users that rely on voice commands will not be able to browse here.\r\n\r\n* [Add landmarks to all guide pages](https://github.com/rails/rails/commit/9669f4be012f34488d52e16d0b6e40a11399e414) \r\n  \r\n  Landmarks such as header, section, footer, article, and the main content landmark help navigating when using assistive tooling.\r\n\r\n  Since each guide is a self-contained article, a header section with the guide introduction and navigation, a footer section which is not part of the content but a call to action, and the rest can be clearly separated, landmarks here are appropriate.\r\n\r\n* [Make back-to-top work without JavaScript](https://github.com/rails/rails/commit/b33278c01384a7612d0adf2270456718181b5acb) \r\n\r\n  By doing feature detection on animation timeline CSS, the graceful degradation can take care of the visibility of the back-to-top button. In case no JavaScript is available, it should always be shown.\r\n\r\n* [Enable back-to-top without JavaScript](https://github.com/rails/rails/commit/430f27c959f0df30b6baeea3d688d8fa5448f842) \r\n\r\n  And add an accessible label to the button. It would be better to just show the text back to top underneath the arrow, but this change is again better than not having it at all.\r\n\r\n* [Consistent scrolling behaviour respecting pref](https://github.com/rails/rails/commit/f2ae0318736a286a13d896cad8527bd2d1443c50) \r\n\r\n  Use the preference to detect if a user wants reduced motion and if not enable smooth scrolling. This takes care of the back-to-top smooth scrolling, and also adds it to anchor links. If this is unwanted, the change can be reverted and a matchmedia check should be done in JavaScript instead before smooth scrolling\r\n\r\n* [Add skip links to quickly navigate past navs](https://github.com/rails/rails/commit/653b292ac26b2df59ebeb44fc9415ebc8130243b) \r\n  \r\n  Skip links are a common practice to allow keyboard and other users to skip past large blocks of content that are present on every page, which in this case are the secondary navigation at the top,\r\nthe version selector, and the chapter navigation.\r\n\r\n  The skip links only show when focused.\r\n\r\n* [Wrap tables to make them responsive](https://github.com/rails/rails/commit/e2cfe8fdfccfcb47aec2f358b0badab79c817981)\r\n\r\n* [Make back-to-top link to skip link](https://github.com/rails/rails/commit/ad966a42de9e166ab33026b28fc8dda64f5fbdd1) \r\n\r\n  This allow screen readers to announce something, because linking to an empty fragment or the body element doesn't announce anything useful.\r\n\r\n* [Add branded selectable color](https://github.com/rails/rails/commit/2557614d872629462e354b2bd1536736aa2077be) \r\n\r\n  Fixes selecting text in dark mode and brands it for both modes.\r\n\r\n* [Make more info and guides index accessible](https://github.com/rails/rails/commit/f9eaeb18d8c5712ae0f2edf351ff9829c996bf78) \r\n\r\n  * Adds aria-controls, which binds the control to the content.\r\n  * Adds aria-expanded, which signals the current expansion state.\r\n  * Adds focus handling, which focuses the first link or the button\r\n    depending on the expansion state.\r\n  * Adds keyboard closing for the more info button.\r\n  * Adds outside click tracking to close the expanded content.\r\n  * Fixes the more info button to not be focusable.\r\n\r\n* [Fix dark mode for guide selector](https://github.com/rails/rails/commit/9c4cfd00492a2bd55db9ed5b5a9a616a962c153a)\r\n\r\n* [Add accessible label for guide navigator](https://github.com/rails/rails/commit/93f9819c62890301f398e752b6083c9d2c9f6c40)\r\n\r\n### Additional information\r\n\r\nPlease note that this PR doesn't necessarily make the guides completely accessible and we should continue to improve on this, but this gets us (a big) part of the way there, together with the changes that were already made prior.\r\n\r\n| Before | After |\r\n| ------ | ----- |\r\n| You could not focus the selector pressing \"Version\" | ![a11y-focusable-label-version](https://github.com/rails/rails/assets/1964376/58f5d1a7-a6ef-47e2-86ac-6e1e0288a18c) |\r\n| The element (version selector) was broken if JavaScript was disabled | ![a11y-no-js-desktop](https://github.com/rails/rails/assets/1964376/0a93871b-c55a-4f9b-a524-86f6024f39b7) |\r\n| The element (version selector) was broken if JavaScript was disabled | ![a11y-no-js-mobile](https://github.com/rails/rails/assets/1964376/5075e1ac-c888-496e-8fa4-4f9066d6aa43) |\r\n| ![a11y-before-table-wrap](https://github.com/rails/rails/assets/1964376/29e41733-60ce-4933-9d4f-36a9fad972e8) | ![a11y-after-table-wrap](https://github.com/rails/rails/assets/1964376/303818b1-d3af-45e3-9ea7-08121c91f04c) |\r\n| You could not skip past the secondary top navigation | ![a11y-main-skip-link](https://github.com/rails/rails/assets/1964376/8d2c1af0-7575-4089-8e89-e7cfb42c8975) |\r\n| You could not skip past the chapter navigation | ![a11y-chapter-skip-link](https://github.com/rails/rails/assets/1964376/87cccb26-f7ae-4ae9-a382-145d6cbd963e) |\r\n| ![a11y-selectable-text-before](https://github.com/rails/rails/assets/1964376/e9e9b56f-08de-45d8-955f-c7884b33a387) | ![a11y-selectable-text](https://github.com/rails/rails/assets/1964376/c938bbde-54ee-480b-b295-6a91bdd8c7e7) |\r\n| There was no label indicating what the select does | ![a11y-guide-selector](https://github.com/rails/rails/assets/1964376/cfaf0501-516b-4ad3-bc30-d77701f01164) |\r\n\r\n### Checklist\r\n\r\nBefore submitting the PR make sure the following are checked:\r\n\r\n* [X] This Pull Request is related to one change.
