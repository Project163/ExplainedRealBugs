#50160\r\n\r\n### Motivation / Background\r\n\r\nThe `object_id` name may be used by polymorphic relations where `object` is the best name, like `notification.object`. In that case two columns are created: `object_id` and `object_type`.\r\n\r\nThis Pull Request has been created because we have a rails application that uses the `object` as the polymorphic relationship name, and it seems to be the best name. It was allowed until rails 7.1 and was not breaking anything.\r\n\r\nUsing the `object_id` as a column name [was explicitly allowed here](https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/38990) \r\n\r\n### Detail\r\n\r\nThis Pull Request removes the `object_id` from the list of not allowed column names. \r\nFor the sake of consitency, the comments and tests are updated where relevant to use the `__id__` method instead.\r\n\r\n### Additional information\r\n\r\nThe method `object_id` [was added to the dangerous method list here](https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/45883)\r\n\r\nUsing the `object_id` as a column name [was previously explicitly allowed here](https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/38990) \r\n\r\n### Checklist\r\n\r\nBefore submitting the PR make sure the following are checked:\r\n\r\n* [x] This Pull Request is related to one change. Changes that are unrelated should be opened in separate PRs.\r\n* [x] Commit message has a detailed description of what changed and why. If this PR fixes a related issue include it in the commit message. Ex: `[Fix #issue-number]`\r\n* [ ] Tests are added or updated if you fix a bug or add a feature.\r\n* [x] CHANGELOG files are updated for the changed libraries if there is a behavior change or additional feature. Minor bug fixes and documentation changes should not be included.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/50162/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/50162/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/1826075673","html_url":"https://github.com/rails/rails/issues/50160#issuecomment-1826075673","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/50160","id":1826075673,"node_id":"IC_kwDNIULObNe0GQ","user":{"login":"byroot","id":44640,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0NjQw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/44640?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/byroot","html_url":"https://github.com/byroot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/byroot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/byroot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/byroot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/byroot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/byroot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/byroot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/byroot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/byroot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/byroot/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-11-24T20:47:51Z","updated_at":"2023-11-24T20:47:51Z","body":"I don't mind allowing it again, but we should find some way to test that active record itself doesn't rely on it :)","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/1826075673/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"byroot","id":44640,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0NjQw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/44640?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/byroot","html_url":"https://github.com/byroot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/byroot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/byroot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/byroot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/byroot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/byroot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/byroot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/byroot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/byroot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/byroot/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/1826089986","html_url":"https://github.com/rails/rails/issues/50160#issuecomment-1826089986","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/50160","id":1826089986,"node_id":"IC_kwDNIULObNfsAg","user":{"login":"fatkodima","id":5657035,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTcwMzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5657035?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fatkodima","html_url":"https://github.com/fatkodima","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fatkodima/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fatkodima/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fatkodima/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fatkodima/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fatkodima/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fatkodima/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fatkodima/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fatkodima/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fatkodima/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-11-24T21:18:20Z","updated_at":"2023-11-24T21:18:20Z","body":"Custom rubocop cop probably.
