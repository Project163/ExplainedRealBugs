This was the case prior to Rails 8.0.3:\n```ruby\nRails::VERSION::STRING\n# => \"8.0.2.1\"\n\nenum = Enumerator.new(1) do |yielder|\n  yielder.yield(1, \"one\")\nend\n\nenum.first\n# => [1, \"one\"]\n\nenum.rewind\n\nenum.sole\n# => [1, \"one\"]\n```\n\n### Actual behavior\n\n#54341 changed the behavior of `Enumerable#sole`, causing it to only return the first element of tuples instead of the full tuple.\n\n### System configuration\n\n**Rails version**: 8.0.3\n\n**Ruby version**: 3.4.4\n","closed_by":{"login":"byroot","id":44640,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0NjQw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/44640?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/byroot","html_url":"https://github.com/byroot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/byroot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/byroot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/byroot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/byroot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/byroot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/byroot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/byroot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/byroot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/byroot/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/55807/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/55807/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
