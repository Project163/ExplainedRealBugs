to #46282.\r\n\r\nThe purpose of the optimization from #46282 is to avoid unnecessary `deserialize` / `cast` / `serialize` calls associated with invoking `value_for_database` on an attribute that has not changed.  `dup`ing the attribute accomplishes that, but `dup`ing the attribute's value is not appropriate for some value types.  For example, a value of the type `ActiveModel::Type::ImmutableString` requires `clone` instead of `dup`, and a value of the type `ActiveRecord::Type::Json` likely requires `deep_dup`.  In some cases the only appropriate method may be `deserialize(serialize(value))`, such as when a serializer for the type `ActiveRecord::Type::Serialized` deserializes `ActiveRecord::Base` instances.  (In that case, `dup`ing the value would clear its `id`, and `clone`ing the value would only produce a shallow copy.)  However, `deserialize(serialize(value))` is expensive and would defeat the purpose of the optimization.\r\n\r\nInstead of `dup`ing the attribute, this commit changes the optimization to use `with_value_from_database(value_before_type_cast)`, which parallels `with_value_from_database(value_for_database)` in the base implementation.  This drops the (cast) value entirely, causing a fresh copy to be deserialized if the attribute is subsequently read.  In cases where the attribute is _not_ subsequently read, this will actually be more efficient since no extra work is performed.

It was extremely helpful! :bow:\r\n\r\nSo, in my opinion, the root problem is that `ActiveModel::Attribute#initialize_dup` assumes that attribute values can be copied simply by calling `dup`:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/rails/rails/blob/e74179654241ff2a7ce3f4861f83a7d073a12ddb/activemodel/lib/active_model/attribute.rb#L155-L159\r\n\r\nThat can cause surprising behavior in other situations too:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nuser = User.create!(name: 'Tom')\r\n\r\nconfiguration = user.create_configuration!\r\nconfiguration.options << Option.create(key: 'key', value: 'secret')\r\n\r\nuser.update!(cached_configuration: configuration)\r\n\r\nuser.cached_configuration.options.size     # => 1\r\nuser.dup.cached_configuration.options.size # => 0\r\n```\r\n\r\nOr, a more simplified example:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nclass MyModel\r\n  include ActiveModel::Attributes\r\n\r\n  attribute :foo, :immutable_string, default: \"foo\"\r\nend\r\n\r\nm = MyModel.new\r\n\r\nm.dup.foo.frozen? # => true\r\nm.foo.frozen?     # => true\r\nm.dup.foo.frozen? # => false\r\n```\r\n\r\n(Though if you are using `ActiveModel::Dirty` — as `ActiveRecord::Base` does — [its `initialize_dup`](https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/e74179654241ff2a7ce3f4861f83a7d073a12ddb/activemodel/lib/active_model/dirty.rb#L248-L256) will cover up the issue with frozen strings.)\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, fixing `ActiveModel::Attribute#initialize_dup` is tricky due to cross-cutting concerns.  I will continue to think about it, but for now I have submitted #49832 to fix this issue specifically.\r\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/1783925595/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"jonathanhefner","id":771968,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc3MTk2OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/771968?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonathanhefner","html_url":"https://github.com/jonathanhefner","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonathanhefner/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonathanhefner/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonathanhefner/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonathanhefner/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonathanhefner/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonathanhefner/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonathanhefner/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonathanhefner/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonathanhefner/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":10798594243,"node_id":"MEE_lADNIULOdSRZis8AAAACg6V4ww","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/events/10798594243","actor":{"login":"fatkodima","id":5657035,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTcwMzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5657035?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fatkodima","html_url":"https://github.com/fatkodima","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fatkodima/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fatkodima/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fatkodima/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fatkodima/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fatkodima/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fatkodima/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fatkodima/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fatkodima/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fatkodima/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2023-10-28T21:34:52Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":10798594245,"node_id":"SE_lADNIULOdSRZis8AAAACg6V4xQ","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/events/10798594245","actor":{"login":"fatkodima","id":5657035,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTcwMzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5657035?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fatkodima","html_url":"https://github.com/fatkodima","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fatkodima/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fatkodima/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fatkodima/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fatkodima/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fatkodima/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fatkodima/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fatkodima/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fatkodima/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fatkodima/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2023-10-28T21:34:52Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":10798601061,"node_id":"CE_lADNIULOdSRZis8AAAACg6WTZQ","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/events/10798601061","actor":{"login":"jonathanhefner","id":771968,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc3MTk2OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/771968?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonathanhefner","html_url":"https://github.com/jonathanhefner","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonathanhefner/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonathanhefner/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonathanhefner/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonathanhefner/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonathanhefner/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonathanhefner/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonathanhefner/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonathanhefner/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jonathanhefner/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2023-10-28T21:41:07Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_gi
