check for `Base.connected?` was added in\r\nhttps://github.com/rails/rails/commit/4ecdf24bdedfdd1cca1f079259ff2490e2074067. At the time this change was made, we were calling\r\n`Base.connection.reset_runtime` so it made sense to check if the database was connected. Since\r\nhttps://github.com/rails/rails/commit/dd61a817dea85990f13664d74bca15bc5796b76e we have stored that information in a thread instead, negating the need to check `Base.connected?`.\r\n\r\nThe problem with checking `Base.connected?` is that in a multi-db application this will return `false` for any model running a query not inheriting from `Base`, leaving the `db_runtime` payload `nil`. Since the information we need is stored in a thread rather than on the connection directly we can remove the `Base.connected?` check.\r\n\r\nFixes #48687","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/48708/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/48708/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":9776611768,"node_id":"CE_lADNIULOausNzs8AAAACRrtBuA","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/events/9776611768","actor":{"login":"eileencodes","id":1080678,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwODA2Nzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1080678?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/eileencodes","html_url":"https://github.com/eileencodes","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eileencodes/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eileencodes/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eileencodes/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eileencodes/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eileencodes/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eileencodes/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eileencodes/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eileencodes/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eileencodes/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2023-07-10T15:44:36Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/1649623406","html_url":"https://github.com/rails/rails/issues/48687#issuecomment-1649623406","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/48687","id":1649623406,"node_id":"IC_kwDNIULOYlNBbg","user":{"login":"pospieszynski","id":15077823,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MDc3ODIz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15077823?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pospieszynski","html_url":"https://github.com/pospieszynski","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pospieszynski/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pospieszynski/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pospieszynski/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pospieszynski/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pospieszynski/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pospieszynski/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pospieszynski/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pospieszynski/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pospieszynski/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-07-25T11:06:28Z","updated_at":"2023-07-25T11:06:28Z","body":"Thank you @eileencodes !
