This resulted in the association writer method defined during the second declaration to get utilised instead of the first (I'm unsure yet if it's duplicated or overridden), which is not surprising considering the ordering, but unexpected if you're unaware that the declaration was duplicated.\r\n\r\n<!-- Paste your executable test case created from one of the scripts found [here](https://edgeguides.rubyonrails.org/contributing_to_ruby_on_rails.html#create-an-executable-test-case) below: -->\r\n```ruby\r\n# frozen_string_literal: true\r\n\r\nrequire \"bundler/inline\"\r\n\r\ngemfile(true) do\r\n  source \"https://rubygems.org\"\r\n\r\n  git_source(:github) { |repo| \"https://github.com/#{repo}.git\" }\r\n\r\n  gem \"rails\", github: \"rails/rails\", branch: \"main\"\r\n  gem \"sqlite3\"\r\nend\r\n\r\nrequire \"active_record\"\r\nrequire \"minitest/autorun\"\r\nrequire \"logger\"\r\n\r\n# This connection will do for database-independent bug reports.\r\nActiveRecord::Base.establish_connection(adapter: \"sqlite3\", database: \":memory:\")\r\nActiveRecord::Base.logger = Logger.new(STDOUT)\r\n\r\nActiveRecord::Schema.define do\r\n  create_table :posts, force: true do |t|\r\n  end\r\n\r\n  create_table :comments, force: true do |t|\r\n    t.integer :post_id\r\n  end\r\nend\r\n\r\nclass Post < ActiveRecord::Base\r\n  has_many :comments\r\n  accepts_nested_attributes_for :comments, update_only: true\r\n  accepts_nested_attributes_for :comments # I feel like this should raise an error on load\r\nend\r\n\r\nclass Comment < ActiveRecord::Base\r\n  belongs_to :post\r\nend\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\n<!-- Tell us what should happen -->\r\n\r\nI think this should raise an error on load.
