When the server boots up, 2 threads hit the same `UnboundTemplate` instance before it has set up `@templates`. Both threads get past the `unless template = @templates[locals]` check because `@templates[locals]` isn't set yet. However, with `@write_lock`, one thread waits while the other one proceeds, setting `@templates` to a frozen hash. The second thread then gets the write lock and tries to modify `@templates` but it has been frozen.\r\n\r\nIt looks to me like it might make sense to move the `@templates[locals.dup] = template` bit into an `else` case below to prevent subsequent threads from trying to modify the hash.\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\nIt's a bit tricky to reproduce, but I think you could do it if you put a binding just after the `unless template = @templates[locals]` and had two processes try to access a template for the first time. When both are there, you could exit the bindings and one process should cause an error.\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\n\r\nIt should not raise an error when templates are loaded and strict locals are in use.\r\n\r\n### Actual behavior\r\n\r\nWe get errors on many of our deploys as the server boots up.\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n**Rails version**: 7.1.2\r\n\r\n**Ruby version**: 3.2.2\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"rafaelfranca","id":47848,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3ODQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47848?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelfranca","html_url":"https://github.com/rafaelfranca","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelfranca/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelfranca/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelfranca/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelfranca/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelfranca/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelfranca/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelfranca/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelfranca/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rafaelfranca/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/50774/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/50774/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
