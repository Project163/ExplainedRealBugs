After digging a little into this issue it became clear that the proxy cache in front of our application has cached a broken image. A cache purge always fixed it. \r\n\r\nAfter digging a little deeper i think i found the source. The proxy cache is getting a `cache-control` header instructing it to do so by the ActiveStorage::Representations::ProxyController!\r\n\r\nIve created a synthetic test which reproduces it. The response is successful with zero length and cache-control header set. The following test falsely passed!\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\n    ActiveStorage::Service::DiskService.any_instance.expects(:download).raises(ActiveStorage::FileNotFoundError)\r\n    \r\n    get active_storage_image_url # \"/rails/active_storage/representations/proxy/...\"\r\n\r\n    assert_response :ok\r\n    assert_equal 'image/png', response.content_type\r\n    assert_equal \"0\", response.headers['Content-Length']\r\n    assert response.headers.key? 'ETag'\r\n    assert_equal \"max-age=3155695200, public\", response.headers['Cache-Control']\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\nOn an error like `ActiveStorage::FileNotFoundError` the response should not be successful nor should it instruct caches to cache that empty response.\r\n\r\n### Actual behavior\r\nOn an error like `ActiveStorage::FileNotFoundError` the response is still successful (Statuscode: 200) and a cache-control header is instructing caches to cache this empty response.\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n**Rails version**: 7.0.8\r\n\r\n**Ruby version**: 3.1.2\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"tenderlove","id":3124,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxMjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3124?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tenderlove","html_url":"https://github.com/tenderlove","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tenderlove/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tenderlove/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tenderlove/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tenderlove/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tenderlove/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tenderlove/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tenderlove/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tenderlove/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tenderlove/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/51284/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/51284/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
