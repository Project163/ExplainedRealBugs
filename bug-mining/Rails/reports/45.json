Write a class MyClass that implements a class method named `permitted?`\r\n2. Write a job BuggyJob with a `perform` method that accepts a class as a parameter\r\n3. Enqueue a BuggyJob job with MyClass as an argument: `BuggyJob.perform_later(MyClass)`\r\n\r\nThe issue seems to be here: https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/main/activejob/lib/active_job/arguments.rb#L93\r\nIt seems in the switch statement to choose the correct serializer for the argument, we attempt to call `serialize_indifferent_hash` on `argument.to_h` if it responds to `permitted?`. I suppose the assumption here is that if the argument responds to `permitted?`, it should be an instance of `ActionController::Parameters`? In our app, we have a module that defines a class method named `permitted?` for some other business logic and it's used in a few classes.\r\n\r\n<!-- Paste your executable test case created from one of the scripts found [here](https://edgeguides.rubyonrails.org/contributing_to_ruby_on_rails.html#create-an-executable-test-case) below: -->\r\n```ruby\r\n# frozen_string_literal: true\r\n\r\nrequire \"bundler/inline\"\r\n\r\ngemfile(true) do\r\n  source \"https://rubygems.org\"\r\n\r\n  git_source(:github) { |repo| \"https://github.com/#{repo}.git\" }\r\n\r\n  # Activate the gem you are reporting the issue against.\r\n  gem \"activejob\", \"~> 7.0.0\"\r\nend\r\n\r\nrequire \"minitest/autorun\"\r\nrequire \"active_job\"\r\n\r\nclass MyClass\r\n  def self.permitted?\r\n    # noop\r\n  end\r\nend\r\n\r\nclass BuggyJob < ActiveJob::Base\r\n  def perform(klass)\r\n    puts \"performed\"\r\n  end\r\nend\r\n\r\nclass BuggyJobTest < ActiveJob::TestCase\r\n  def test_stuff\r\n    error = assert_raises(NoMethodError) { BuggyJob.perform_later(MyClass) }\r\n    assert_match /undefined method `to_h' for MyClass:Class/, error.message\r\n  end\r\nend\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\n<!-- Tell us what should happen -->\r\nA BuggyJob job should successfully be queued, with the MyClass argument serialized using ActiveJob::Serializers::ModuleSerializer.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Actual behavior\r\n<!-- Tell us what happens instead -->\r\nA NoMethodError is raised:\r\n```\r\nFailed enqueuing BuggyJob to DelayedJob(default): NoMethodError (undefined method `to_h' for MyClass:Class\r\nDid you mean?  to_s)\r\n.../ruby/3.0.0/gems/activejob-6.1.7.3/lib/active_job/arguments.rb:120:in `serialize_argument': undefined method `to_h' for MyClass:Class (NoMethodError)\r\nDid you mean?  to_s\r\n```\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n**Rails version**: Tested on 6.1.x, 7.0.x\r\n\r\n**Ruby version**: Tested on 3.0.4\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"guilleiguaran","id":160941,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MDk0MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/160941?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/guilleiguaran","html_url":"https://github.com/guilleiguaran","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guilleiguaran/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guilleiguaran/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guilleiguaran/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guilleiguaran/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guilleiguaran/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guilleiguaran/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guilleiguaran/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guilleiguaran/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guilleiguaran/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/48561/reactions","total_count":3,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":1,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/48561/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
