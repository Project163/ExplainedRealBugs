for contributing to Rails!\r\n\r\nPlease do not make *Draft* pull requests, as they still send\r\nnotifications to everyone watching the Rails repo.\r\n\r\nCreate a pull request when it is ready for review and feedback\r\nfrom the Rails team :).\r\n\r\nIf your pull request affects documentation or any non-code\r\nchanges, guidelines for those changes are [available\r\nhere](https://edgeguides.rubyonrails.org/contributing_to_ruby_on_rails.html#contributing-to-the-rails-documentation)\r\n\r\nAbout this template\r\n\r\nThe following template aims to help contributors write a good description for their pull requests.\r\nWe'd like you to provide a description of the changes in your pull request (i.e. bugs fixed or features added), the motivation behind the changes, and complete the checklist below before opening a pull request.\r\n\r\nFeel free to discard it if you need to (e.g. when you just fix a typo). -->\r\n\r\n### Motivation / Background\r\n\r\nFixes #52742\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nDescribe why this Pull Request needs to be merged. What bug have you fixed? What feature have you added? Why is it important?\r\nIf you are fixing a specific issue, include \"Fixes #ISSUE\" (replace with the issue number, remove the quotes) and the issue will be linked to this PR.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis Pull Request has been created because when dumping a PostgreSQL schema that includes a `float4` column (defined as `float(24)`), the column is represented as `float` in the generated schema dump. However, when loading this schema, the `float4` column is converted to `float8`.\r\n\r\n### Detail\r\n\r\nThis Pull Request fixes https://github.com/rails/rails/issues/52742\r\n\r\n### Checklist\r\n\r\nBefore submitting the PR make sure the following are checked:\r\n\r\n* [x] This Pull Request is related to one change. Unrelated changes should be opened in separate PRs.\r\n* [x] Commit message has a detailed description of what changed and why. If this PR fixes a related issue include it in the commit message. Ex: `[Fix #issue-number]`\r\n* [x] Tests are added or updated if you fix a bug or add a feature.\r\n* [x] CHANGELOG files are updated for the changed libraries if there is a behavior change or additional feature. Minor bug fixes and documentation changes should not be included.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/53107/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/53107/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":14449946869,"node_id":"REFE_lADNIULOlKShIM8AAAADXUiw9Q","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/events/14449946869","actor":{"login":"tnagatomi","id":3647470,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2NDc0NzA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3647470?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tnagatomi","html_url":"https://github.com/tnagatomi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tnagatomi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tnagatomi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tnagatomi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tnagatomi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tnagatomi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tnagatomi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tnagatomi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tnagatomi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tnagatomi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"f39e7563f7376d365eda6a993254b6165aaa7979","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tnagatomi/rails/commits/f39e7563f7376d365eda6a993254b6165aaa7979","created_at":"2024-09-30T06:24:18Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":14449970071,"node_id":"REFE_lADNIULOlKShIM8AAAADXUkLlw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/events/14449970071","actor":{"login":"tnagatomi","id":3647470,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2NDc0NzA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3647470?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tnagatomi","html_url":"https://github.com/tnagatomi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tnagatomi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tnagatomi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tnagatomi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tnagatomi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tnagatomi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tnagatomi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tnagatomi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tnagatomi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tnagatomi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"8c6d6a2978c520be320c8a7ab5fa56e1cfc6cdec","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tnagatomi/rails/commits/8c6d6a2978c520be320c8a7ab5fa56e1cfc6cdec","created_at":"2024-09-30T06:26:40Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":14450807117,"node_id":"CE_lADNIULOlKShIM8AAAADXVXRTQ","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/events/14450807117","actor":{"login":"kamipo","id":12642,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNjQy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12642?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kamipo","html_url":"https://github.com/kamipo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kamipo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kamipo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kamipo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kamipo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kamipo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kamipo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kamipo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kamipo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kamipo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2024-09-30T07:28:45Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":14510793552,"node_id":"REFE_lADNIULOlKShIM8AAAADYOkjUA","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/events/14510793552","actor":{"login":"DanielaVelasquez","id":15008564,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MDA4NTY0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15008564?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/DanielaVelasquez","html_url":"https://github.com/DanielaVelasquez","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DanielaVelasquez/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DanielaVelasquez/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DanielaVelasquez/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DanielaVelasquez/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com
