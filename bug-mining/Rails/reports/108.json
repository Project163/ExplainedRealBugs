There is an open issue addressing that `IPAddr#==` does not work as expected https://github.com/ruby/ipaddr/issues/21\r\n\r\nIt is possible to monkey-patch `ActiveRecord::ConnectionAdapters::PostgreSQL::OID::Cidr` to work as expected:\r\n```\r\nclass ActiveRecord::ConnectionAdapters::PostgreSQL::OID::Cidr\r\n  def changed?(old_value, new_value, _new_value_before_type_cast)\r\n    return old_value.nil? != new_value.nil? || (!old_value.nil? && !old_value.eql?(new_value))\r\n  end\r\nend\r\n```\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n**Rails version**: 7.1.3.2\r\n\r\n**Ruby version**: 3.3.0\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"yahonda","id":73684,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjczNjg0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/73684?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yahonda","html_url":"https://github.com/yahonda","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yahonda/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yahonda/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yahonda/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yahonda/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yahonda/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yahonda/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yahonda/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yahonda/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yahonda/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/51582/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/51582/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
