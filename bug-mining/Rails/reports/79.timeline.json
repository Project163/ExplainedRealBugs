for contributing to Rails!\r\n\r\nPlease do not make *Draft* pull requests, as they still send\r\nnotifications to everyone watching the Rails repo.\r\n\r\nCreate a pull request when it is ready for review and feedback\r\nfrom the Rails team :).\r\n\r\nIf your pull request affects documentation or any non-code\r\nchanges, guidelines for those changes are [available\r\nhere](https://edgeguides.rubyonrails.org/contributing_to_ruby_on_rails.html#contributing-to-the-rails-documentation)\r\n\r\nAbout this template\r\n\r\nThe following template aims to help contributors write a good description for their pull requests.\r\nWe'd like you to provide a description of the changes in your pull request (i.e. bugs fixed or features added), motivation behind the changes, and complete the checklist below before opening a pull request.\r\n\r\nFeel free to discard it if you need to (e.g. when you just fix a typo). -->\r\n\r\n### Motivation / Background\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nDescribe why this Pull Request needs to be merged. What bug have you fixed? What feature have you added? Why is it important?\r\nIf you are fixing a specific issue, include \"Fixes #ISSUE\" (replace with the issue number, remove the quotes) and the issue will be linked to this PR. See #50005 for details.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis Pull Request has been created because the `ActiveStorage::TransformJob` crashes if you want to preprocess a previewable file like a pdf document. \r\n\r\n### Detail\r\n\r\nThis Pull Request changes that by determining if a blob is capable of being previewed. If so, a preview will be generated. \r\n\r\n### Additional information\r\nThe `ActiveStorage::TransformJob` is being used when an attachment has predefined variants with the `preprocessed` option. When you upload a file which is **not** an image but a previewable file like a pdf-document this will fail with `ActiveStorage::InvariableError`.\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n```\r\nhas_one_attached :file do |attachable|\r\n    attachable.preview :thumb, resize_to_limit: [400, 600], preprocessed: true\r\nend\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Checklist\r\n\r\nBefore submitting the PR make sure the following are checked:\r\n\r\n* [x] This Pull Request is related to one change. Changes that are unrelated should be opened in separate PRs.\r\n* [x] Commit message has a detailed description of what changed and why. If this PR fixes a related issue include it in the commit message. Fix #50005\r\n* [x] Tests are added or updated if you fix a bug or add a feature.\r\n* [x] CHANGELOG files are updated for the changed libraries if there is a behavior change or additional feature. Minor bug fixes and documentation changes should not be included.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/50006/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/50006/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":10927694163,"node_id":"LE_lADNIULOdn1Zlc8AAAACi1dhUw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/events/10927694163","actor":{"login":"paulreece","id":96156234,"node_id":"U_kgDOBbs6Sg","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/96156234?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulreece","html_url":"https://github.com/paulreece","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulreece/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulreece/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulreece/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulreece/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulreece/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulreece/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulreece/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulreece/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulreece/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2023-11-10T17:26:59Z","label":{"name":"attached
