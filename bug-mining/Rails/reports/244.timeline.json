generating a Rails app with `rails new folder --name=sample`, the devcontainer's compose.yaml was incorrectly mounting the volume using the app name instead of the actual folder name.

While this improved isolation, it didn't account for cases where the app name and folder name differ.\r\n\r\nFixes
