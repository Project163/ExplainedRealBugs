Motivation / Background\r\n\r\nThis commit brings back #45979 only when RubyGems version is 3.3.13 or higher that includes https://github.com/rubygems/rubygems/pull/5486\r\n\r\nPull request #45979 has been reverted via #47524 because the default versions of RubyGems shipped with Ruby 2.7 and 3.0 are lower than 3.3.13. If users who bumps the RubyGems version or uses Ruby 3.1 or higher, RubyGems version should be satisfied to support prerelease rubies.\r\n\r\nRef #45979 #47524\r\nFix #47542\r\n\r\n### Detail\r\nHere are details of how `Gem.ruby_version` works between RubyGems 3.3.12 and3.3.13. \r\n\r\n- RubyGems 3.3.12` Gem.ruby_version` includes patch level\r\n```ruby\r\n$ gem -v\r\n3.3.12\r\n$ irb\r\nirb(main):001:0> Gem.ruby_version\r\n=> Gem::Version.new(\"3.1.3.p185\")\r\n```\r\n\r\n- RubyGems 3.3.13` Gem.ruby_version` does not include patch level\r\n```ruby\r\n$ gem -v\r\n3.3.13\r\n$ irb\r\nirb(main):001:0> Gem.ruby_version\r\n=> Gem::Version.new(\"3.1.3\")\r\nirb(main):002:0>\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Additional information\r\n\r\n<!-- Provide additional information such as benchmarks, reference to other repositories or alternative solutions. -->\r\n\r\n### Checklist\r\n\r\nBefore submitting the PR make sure the following are checked:\r\n\r\n* [x] This Pull Request is related to one change. Changes that are unrelated should be opened in separate PRs.\r\n* [x] Commit message has a detailed description of what changed and why. If this PR fixes a related issue include it in the commit message.
