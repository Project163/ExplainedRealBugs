The `check_param_encoding` method on https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/main/actionpack/lib/action_dispatch/request/utils.rb#L36 only checks the param **values** and not the **keys**.\n\nChanging L36 from `params.each_value { |value| check_param_encoding(value) }` to `params.each { |value| check_param_encoding(value) }` fixes the problem for me.\n\n### System configuration\n**Rails version**: 7.1.3.4\n\n**Ruby version**: 3.3.1\n\n**Rack version**: 3.1.12","closed_by":{"login":"byroot","id":44640,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0NjQw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/44640?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/byroot","html_url":"https://github.com/byroot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/byroot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/byroot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/byroot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/byroot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/byroot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/byroot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/byroot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/byroot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/byroot/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/52114/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":1},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/52114/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
