 Customizing Form Builders
 -------------------------

Form builders encapsulate the notion of displaying form elements for a single object. While you can write helpers for your forms in the usual way, you can also create a subclass of `ActionView::Helpers::FormBuilder`, and add the helpers there. For example,

 If you reuse this frequently you could define a `labeled_form_with` helper that automatically applies the `builder: LabellingFormBuilder` option:
