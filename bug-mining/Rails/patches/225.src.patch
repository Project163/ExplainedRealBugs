+*   Reverted the incorrect default `config.public_file_server.headers` config.
+
+    If you created a new application using Rails `8.1.0.beta1`, make sure to regenerate
+    `config/environments/production.rb`, or to manually edit the `config.public_file_server.headers`
+    configuration to just be:
+
+    ```ruby
+    # Cache assets for far-future expiry since they are all digest stamped.
+    config.public_file_server.headers = { "cache-control" => "public, max-age=#{1.year.to_i}" }
+    ```

 ## Rails 8.1.0.beta1 (September 04, 2025) ##
 
 *   Add command `rails credentials:fetch PATH` to get the value of a credential from the credentials file.
