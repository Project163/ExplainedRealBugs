The algorithm is fundamentally wrong.  There is already some nice randomized testing but it doesn't test that the range is too wide.  In particular, a -180 to 180 range should be double-checked that picking a longitude at random is always inside one of the shapes.  I added such a test and it fails quickly.\n\nIf we know the shapes are all points, then there's a simple O(N) algorithm I can and should do.  But ShapeCollection isn't yet typed.\n\nI can think of an O(N^2) algorithm which isn't pretty.
