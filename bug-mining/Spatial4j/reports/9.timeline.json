The passed in JTS geometry will in fact be modified if it crosses the dateline.\r\n(B) A bug in Spatial4j's JtsGeometry code, where arguably it ought to not modify it's input JTS Geometry instance.  It will do this if it crosses the dateline.\r\n\r\nGiven dateline crosses are not particularly common, I lean towards fixing
