IMO (which doesn't matter as IANAL) what is currently notice.md wouldn't even be that, it'd be a document named after it's heading \"user-agreement.md\".

This is effectively Spatial4j's dependencies.  Spatial4j only has \"works-with\" dependencies -- which is to say all dependencies are either of a build/test nature (no runtime), or are associated with an \"optional\" feature.  The auto-generated notice only chose \"jackson-databind\" (which is for an \"optional\" feature).  There are two additional dependencies for \"optional\" features (the pom.xml makes it easy to see which dependencies are used how).  Furthermore, jackson-databind also brings along its own transitive dependencies (jackson-core, jackson-annotations) but these aren't listed in pom.xml; maven takes care of the transitive loading.

this?","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/locationtech/spatial4j/issues/comments/373504323/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"dsmiley","id":377295,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3NzI5NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/377295?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsmiley","html_url":"https://github.com/dsmiley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsmiley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsmiley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsmiley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsmiley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsmiley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsmiley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsmiley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsmiley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsmiley/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":1524176605,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MTUyNDE3NjYwNQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/locationtech/spatial4j/issues/events/1524176605","actor":{"login":"waynebeaton","id":555569,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1NTU2OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/555569?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/waynebeaton","html_url":"https://github.com/waynebeaton","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/waynebeaton/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/waynebeaton/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/waynebeaton/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/waynebeaton/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/waynebeaton/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/waynebeaton/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/waynebeaton/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/waynebeaton/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/waynebeaton/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-03-15T20:00:19Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":1524176606,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDE1MjQxNzY2MDY=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/locationtech/spatial4j/issues/events/1524176606","actor":{"login":"waynebeaton","id":555569,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1NTU2OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/555569?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/waynebeaton","html_url":"https://github.com/waynebeaton","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/waynebeaton/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/waynebeaton/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/waynebeaton/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/waynebeaton/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/waynebeaton/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/waynebeaton/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/waynebeaton/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/waynebeaton/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/waynebeaton/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-03-15T20:00:19Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/locationtech/spatial4j/issues/comments/374441720","html_url":"https://github.com/locationtech/spatial4j/issues/157#issuecomment-374441720","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/locationtech/spatial4j/issues/157","id":374441720,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM3NDQ0MTcyMA==","user":{"login":"waynebeaton","id":555569,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1NTU2OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/555569?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/waynebeaton","html_url":"https://github.com/waynebeaton","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/waynebeaton/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/waynebeaton/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/waynebeaton/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/waynebeaton/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/waynebeaton/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/waynebeaton/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/waynebeaton/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/waynebeaton/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/waynebeaton/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public
