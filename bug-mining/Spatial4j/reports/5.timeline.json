But I'm very confident in JtsSpatialContext.getGeometryFrom(circle) working.  If you can submit a pull request for the point-to-line based solution then I'll work with you on that and get it in; otherwise I'll go with the simpler (albeit probably slower route) of JtsSpatialContext.getGeometryFrom(circle).\n\nI want to get a release out in January.  Later this week or next I'm planning to do a spike of activity including adopting Geo3D as an alternative to JTS.  Geo3D should give an accurate answer to this polygon-circle intersection with no projections.
