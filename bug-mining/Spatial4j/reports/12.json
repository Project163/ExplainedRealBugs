When I wrap everything in a shaded jar in the end I get a signature error.\r\n\r\nI think it is because your jar is being signed with the eclipse jar signer plugin.\r\n\r\nSo far I know that bouncy castle signs their jars to make sure that the crypto content isn't modified.\r\n\r\nIs there any such sensitive information in your jar files (eg. crypto implementations)?\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\nHåvard","closed_by":{"login":"dsmiley","id":377295,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3NzI5NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/377295?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsmiley","html_url":"https://github.com/dsmiley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsmiley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsmiley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsmiley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsmiley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsmiley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsmiley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsmiley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsmiley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dsmiley/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/locationtech/spatial4j/issues/168/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/locationtech/spatial4j/issues/168/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
