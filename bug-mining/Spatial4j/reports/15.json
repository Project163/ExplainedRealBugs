Geotools is now using JTS 18.1 and there is an incompatibility compared to JTS 17.0 in spatial4j.\r\nThe InStream in `org.locationtech.spatial4j.io.jts.JtsBinaryCodec.readJtsGeom(DataInput)` has now a return type int instead of void.\r\n\r\nThis should be an easy fix, I will try to provide a PullRequest for that.
