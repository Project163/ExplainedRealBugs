-The facade to all of Spatial4j is the [`SpatialContext`](https://spatial4j.github.io/spatial4j/apidocs/com/spatial4j/core/context/SpatialContext.html). It acts as a factory for shapes and it holds references to most other classes you might use and/or it has convenience methods for them.  For example you can get a [`DistanceCalculator`](https://spatial4j.github.io/spatial4j/apidocs/com/spatial4j/core/distance/DistanceCalculator.html) but if you just want to calculate the distance then the context has a method for that.

-To get a SpatialContext (or just "context" for short), you could use a global singleton `SpatialContext.GEO` or `JtsSpatialContext.GEO` with both use geodesic surface-of-sphere calculations (when available); the JTS one principally adds Polygon support. If you want a non-geodesic implementation or you want to customize one of many options, then instantiate a [`SpatialContextFactory`](https://spatial4j.github.io/spatial4j/apidocs/com/spatial4j/core/context/SpatialContextFactory.html) (or `JtsSpatialContextFactory`), set the options, then invoke `newSpatialContext()`. If you have a set of name-value string pairs, perhaps from a java properties file, then instead use the static `makeSpatialContext(map, classLoader)` method which adds a lot of flexibility to the configuration initialization versus hard-coding it.

 *You should generally avoid calling constructors for anything in Spatial4j except for the `SpatialContextFactory`.* Constructors aren't strictly forbidden but the factories are there to provide an extension point / abstraction, so don't side-step them unless there's a deliberate reason.
