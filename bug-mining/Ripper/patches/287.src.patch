 ### Quick examples comparing tools
 
-This example searches the entire Linux kernel source tree (after running
-`make defconfig && make -j8`) for `[A-Z]+_SUSPEND`, where all matches must be
-words. Timings were collected on a system with an Intel i7-6900K 3.2 GHz, and
-ripgrep was compiled with SIMD enabled.
