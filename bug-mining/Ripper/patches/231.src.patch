 ============
 TODO.
 
+**BREAKING CHANGES**:
+
+* The `avx-accel` feature of ripgrep has been removed since it is no longer
+  necessary. All uses of AVX in ripgrep are now enabled automatically via
+  runtime CPU feature detection. The `simd-accel` feature does remain
+  available, however, it is broken in the latest nightly release of Rust.
+  See [#1175](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/1175) for more
+  info.

 Feature enhancements:
 
 * [FEATURE #1099](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/pull/1099):

 If you have a Rust nightly compiler and a recent Intel CPU, then you can enable
 additional optional SIMD acceleration like so:
 
+**WARNING**: Building with the `simd-accel` feature on the latest Rust nightly

-If your machine doesn't support AVX instructions, then simply remove
-`avx-accel` from the features list. Similarly for SIMD (which corresponds
-roughly to SSE instructions).

-The `simd-accel` and `avx-accel` features enable SIMD support in certain
-ripgrep dependencies (responsible for counting lines and transcoding). They
-are not necessary to get SIMD optimizations for search; those are enabled
-automatically. Hopefully, some day, the `simd-accel` and `avx-accel` features
-will similarly become unnecessary.
