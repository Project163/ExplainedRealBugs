+Why does using a leading `/` on Windows fail?
+</h3>
+
+If you're using cygwin on Windows and try to search for a pattern beginning
+with a `/`, then it's possible that cygwin is mangling that pattern without
+your knowledge. For example, if you tried running `rg /foo` in a cygwin shell
+on Windows, then cygwin might mistakenly perform path translation on `/foo`,
+which would result in `rg C:/msys64/foo` being searched instead.
+
+You can fix this in one of three ways:
+
+1. Stop using cygwin.
+2. Escape the leading slash with an additional slash. e.g., `rg //foo`.
+3. Temporarily disable path translation by setting `MSYS_NO_PATHCONV=1`. e.g.,
+   `MSYS_NO_PATHCONV=1 rg /foo`.
