+#### The special `all` file type
+
+A special option supported by the `--type` flag is `all`. `--type all` looks
+for a match in any of the supported file types listed by `--type-list`,
+including those added on the command line using `--type-add`. It's equivalent
+to the command `rg --type agda --type asciidoc --type asm ...`, where `...`
+stands for a list of `--type` flags for the rest of the types in `--type-list`.
+
+As an example, let's suppose you have a shell script in your current directory,
+`my-shell-script`, which includes a shell library, `my-shell-library.bash`.
+Both `rg --type sh` and `rg --type all` would only search for matches in
+`my-shell-library.bash`, not `my-shell-script`, because the globs matched
+by the `sh` file type don't include files without an extension. On the
+other hand, `rg --type-not all` would search `my-shell-script` but not
+`my-shell-library.bash`.
