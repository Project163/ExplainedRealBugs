+**NOTE:** In the past, ripgrep supported a `simd-accel` Cargo feature when

+Since it required unstable features, this build mode was prone to breakage.
+Because of that, support for it has been removed. If you want SIMD

 Enabling the PCRE2 feature works with a stable Rust compiler and will
 attempt to automatically find and link with your system's PCRE2 library via
 `pkg-config`. If one doesn't exist, then ripgrep will build PCRE2 from source
