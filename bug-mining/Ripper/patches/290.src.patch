@@ -2374,7 +2374,7 @@ Note that PCRE2 is an optional ripgrep feature. If PCRE2 wasn't included in
 your build of ripgrep, then using this flag will result in ripgrep printing
 an error message and exiting. PCRE2 may also have worse user experience in
 some cases, since it has fewer introspection APIs than ripgrep's default regex
-engine. For example, if you use a '\n' in a PCRE2 regex without the
+engine. For example, if you use a '\\n' in a PCRE2 regex without the
 '-U/--multiline' flag, then ripgrep will silently fail to match anything
 instead of reporting an error immediately (like it does with the default
 regex engine).
