+`ripgrep` is a line oriented search tool that combines the usability of The
+Silver Searcher (an `ack` clone) with the raw speed of GNU grep. `ripgrep`
+works by recursively searching your current directory for a regex pattern.
+`ripgrep` has first class support on Windows, Mac and Linux, with binary
+downloads available for
+[every release](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/releases).
+
+ripgrep's regex engine uses finite automata and guarantees linear time
+searching. Because of this, features like backreferences and arbitrary
+lookaround are not supported.
