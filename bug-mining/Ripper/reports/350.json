As `toml::Value` owns strings, it caused a problem.\r\n\r\nIf needed, I can include a MWE (but quite large). \r\n\r\n#### What is the actual behavior?\r\n\r\nWhen parsing some globs, here is the error obtained:\r\n\r\n```\r\nError: TomlDecode(Error { inner: ErrorInner { kind: Custom, line: None, col: 0, at: None, message: \"invalid type: string \\\"src/**.rs\\\", expected a borrowed string\", key: [] } })\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### What is the expected behavior?\r\n\r\nNot sure if it is interesting performance-wise, but using a custom `deserialize_with` function, with `String` instead of `&str`, fixes the problem (`glob.as_str()`) has to be used afterward).\r\n\r\nI can provide tests and make a PR if you are ok with this solution. Otherwise, I am also open to discussions :-)","closed_by":{"login":"BurntSushi","id":456674,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NjY3NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/456674?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi","html_url":"https://github.com/BurntSushi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/2386/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/2386/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
