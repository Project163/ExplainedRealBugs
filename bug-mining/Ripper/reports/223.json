However, it looks like the flag can't be used to make exclusions from the .gitignore case insensitive.\r\n\r\nHere's an example on the Windows command line. You'll notice that `git status` doesn't list `myfile.txt`, but ripgrep does (of course on linux this isn't the case, and the file is listed twice).\r\n\r\n```\r\n> mkdir rgtest\r\n> cd rgtest\r\n> git init\r\n> echo foo > myfile.txt\r\n> echo MYFILE.txt > .gitignore\r\n> git status -s\r\n?? .gitignore\r\n> rg -l foo\r\nmyfile.txt\r\n```\r\n\r\nSorry if I'm missing something obvious, or if this is covered by another issue. I tried searching the man page and didn't find any configuration regarding .gitignore, and found *many* issues related to case insensitive file matching but none as far as I could tell that asked for this specific feature.","closed_by":{"login":"BurntSushi","id":456674,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NjY3NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/456674?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi","html_url":"https://github.com/BurntSushi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/1164/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/1164/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
