Create a file in `/tmp` with some content. I put the following into `/tmp/test_file`:\r\n```\r\nINFO example text\r\nERROR something bad\r\nINFO example text2\r\n```\r\n2. Try to search for `ERROR` using ripgrep: `rg ERROR /tmp/test_file`\r\n3. You should get the output:\r\n```\r\n/tmp/test_file: No such file or directory (os error 2)\r\nNo files were searched, which means ripgrep probably applied a filter you didn't expect. Try running again with --debug.\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### If this is a bug, what is the actual behavior?\r\n\r\nripgrep works for me on other files:\r\n```\r\n$ rg move config\r\n57:# move focused window\r\n58:bindsym $mod+Shift+h move left\r\n...\r\n```\r\n\r\nI have permissions to the `/tmp` file:\r\n```\r\n$ ls -la /tmp\r\ndrwxrwxrwt 15 root        root           139264 Apr 30 10:39 .\r\n...\r\n-rw-rw-r--  1 egoldshtrom egoldshtrom        57 Apr 30 10:32 test_file\r\n...\r\n```\r\n\r\nI can grep the file or if I pipe the contents into ripgrep I can use ripgrep on it:\r\n```\r\n$ grep ERROR /tmp/test_file\r\nERROR something bad\r\n\r\n$ cat /tmp/test_file | rg ERROR\r\nERROR something bad\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut if I try to use ripgrep directly on the file it fails:\r\n```\r\n$ rg ERROR /tmp/test_file\r\n/tmp/test_file: No such file or directory (os error 2)\r\nNo files were searched, which means ripgrep probably applied a filter you didn't expect.
