Basically, ripgrep farms out a lot of the docs for this to `man gitignore`. For example, from the GUIDE:\r\n\r\n> For a more in depth description of how glob patterns in a .gitignore file are interpreted, please see `man gitignore`.\r\n\r\nNow obviously `man gitignore` doesn't mention `.ignore`, so I think we can improve the docs there by essentially mentioning that \"`.ignore` and `.rgignore` work just like `.gitignore`, but with no special connection to git and the presence of `.git` directories.\"\r\n\r\nI don't think I documented this because it never occurred to me that someone would expect the behavior you want. Moreover, the presence of the `--no-ignore-parent` flag (and its docs) implies the behavior that ripgrep has.\r\n\r\n> I was ripgreping for a pattern I knew was in my source, and wasn't getting a result. I immediately checked .gitignore and .ignore files in the current directory and there was nothing that would have filtered out my source. Testing again with --no-ignore showed the content I was expecting.\r\n\r\nI'd strongly recommend that you check out the `--debug` flag. It will tell you what things ripgrep is skipping. That way, you don't have to read gitignore files and apply the matching rules mentally. You can just see exactly what ripgrep is doing.","author_association":"OWNER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/comments/1485926384/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"BurntSushi","id":456674,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NjY3NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/456674?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi","html_url":"https://github.com/BurntSushi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":8858894104,"node_id":"LE_lADOAzJbyc5h7DjxzwAAAAIQB_8Y","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/events/8858894104","actor":{"login":"BurntSushi","id":456674,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NjY3NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/456674?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi","html_url":"https://github.com/BurntSushi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2023-03-27T22:11:03Z","label":{"name":"doc","color":"fbca04"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/comments/1485935670","html_url":"https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/2479#issuecomment-1485935670","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/2479","id":1485935670,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAzJbyc5YkZQ2","user":{"login":"scottchiefbaker","id":3429760,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0Mjk3NjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3429760?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/scottchiefbaker","html_url":"https://github.com/scottchiefbaker","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scottchiefbaker/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scottchiefbaker/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scottchiefbaker/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scottchiefbaker/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scottchiefbaker/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scottchiefbaker/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scottchiefbaker/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scottchiefbaker/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scottchiefbaker/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-03-27T22:19:16Z","updated_at":"2023-03-27T22:19:16Z","body":"My real-world use case for this was that I had a directory `~/html/content/books/2023/` that I was trying to `ripgrep`.

It took me a while to figure out what was going on here. The distinction between `**/node_modules/**` and `**/node_modules/` is pretty subtle, and it's non-obvious how that should affect the behavior of `rg`. If I'm currently *inside* `/node_modules`, my `.ignore` file says to ignore `**/node_modules/**`, and I run a `rg` search, clearly I'm doing something wrong. So maybe `rg` could either (1) ignore my `.ignore` in this case, since I didn't really mean it; or (2) issue a (more specific) warning about what's going on.

by `brew bump`\n\n---\n\nCreated with `brew bump-formula-pr`.<details>\n  <summary>release notes</summary>\n  <pre>ripgrep 14 is a new major version release of ripgrep that has some new\r\nfeatures, performance improvements and a lot of bug fixes.\r\n\r\n> In case you haven't heard of it before, ripgrep is a line-oriented search\r\n> tool that recursively searches the current directory for a regex pattern.\r\n> By default, ripgrep will respect gitignore rules and automatically skip\r\n> hidden files/directories and binary files.\r\n\r\nThe headling feature in this release is hyperlink support. In this release,\r\nthey are an opt-in feature but may change to an opt-out feature in the future.\r\nTo enable them, try passing `--hyperlink-format default`. If you use [VS Code],\r\nthen try passing `--hyperlink-format vscode`. Please [report your experience\r\nwith hyperlinks][report-hyperlinks], positive or negative.\r\n\r\n[VS Code]: https://code.visualstudio.com/\r\n[report-hyperlinks]: https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/discussions/2611\r\n\r\nAnother headling development in this release is that it contains a rewrite of\r\nits regex engine. You generally shouldn't notice any changes, except for some\r\nsearches may get faster. You can read more about the [regex engine rewrite on\r\nmy blog][regex-internals]. Please [report your performance improvements or\r\nregressions that you notice][report-perf].\r\n\r\n[report-perf]: https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/discussions/2652\r\n\r\nFinally, ripgrep switched the library it uses for argument parsing. Users\r\nshould not notice a difference in most cases (error messages have changed\r\nsomewhat), but flag overrides should generally be more consistent. For example,\r\nthings like `--no-ignore --ignore-vcs` work as one would expect (disables all\r\nfiltering related to ignore rules except for rules found in version control\r\nsystems such as `git`).\r\n\r\n[regex-internals]: https://blog.burntsushi.net/regex-internals/\r\n\r\n**BREAKING CHANGES**:\r\n\r\n* `rg -C1 -A2` used to be equivalent to `rg -A2`, but now it is equivalent to\r\n  `rg -B1 -A2`. That is, `-A` and `-B` no longer completely override `-C`.\r\n  Instead, they only partially override `-C`.\r\n\r\nBuild process changes:\r\n\r\n* ripgrep's shell completions and man page are now created by running ripgrep\r\nwith a new `--generate` flag. For example, `rg --generate man` will write a\r\nman page in `roff` format on stdout. The release archives have not changed.\r\n* The optional build dependency on `asciidoc` or `asciidoctor` has been\r\ndropped. Previously, it was used to produce ripgrep's man page. ripgrep now\r\nowns this process itself by writing `roff` directly.\r\n\r\nPerformance improvements:\r\n\r\n* [PERF #1746](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/1746):\r\n  Make some cases with inner literals faster.\r\n* [PERF #1760](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/1760):\r\n  Make most searches with `\\b` look-arounds (among others) much faster.\r\n* [PERF #2591](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/pull/2591):\r\n  Parallel directory traversal now uses work stealing for faster searches.\r\n* [PERF #2642](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/pull/2642):\r\n  Parallel directory traversal has some contention reduced.\r\n\r\nFeature enhancements:\r\n\r\n* Added or improved file type filtering for Ada, DITA, Elixir, Fuchsia, Gentoo,\r\n  Gradle, GraphQL, Markdown, Prolog, Raku, TypeScript, USD, V\r\n* [FEATURE #665](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/665):\r\n  Add a new `--hyperlink-format` flag that turns file paths into hyperlinks.\r\n* [FEATURE #1709](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/1709):\r\n  Improve documentation of ripgrep's behavior when stdout is a tty.\r\n* [FEATURE #1737](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/1737):\r\n  Provide binaries for Apple silicon.\r\n* [FEATURE #1790](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/1790):\r\n  Add new `--stop-on-nonmatch` flag.\r\n* [FEATURE #1814](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/1814):\r\n  Flags are now categorized in `-h/--help` output and ripgrep's man page.\r\n* [FEATURE #1838](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/1838):\r\n  An error is shown when searching for NUL bytes with binary detection enabled.\r\n* [FEATURE #2195](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/2195):\r\n  When `extra-verbose` mode is enabled in zsh, show extra file type info.\r\n* [FEATURE
