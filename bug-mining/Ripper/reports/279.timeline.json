@BurntSushi,\r\n\r\nFirstly, thank you for ripgrep! It's an awesome tool and I'm a long time fan/user.\r\n\r\nI'm working with @JohnC32 on an implementation of this.\r\n\r\nIt was pretty trivial to add a switch to force reading gitignores outside a git repo (basically just an option for the Ignore class).\r\n\r\nHowever, I stumbled across a cleaner (IMHO) way of doing it.\r\n\r\nI noticed you have a \"custom ignore\" functionality baked in, which, if I understand correctly, is being used to read patterns from `.rgignore` files. As far as I can tell, there is no switch that lets the user create new custom ignores.\r\n\r\nWould you be open to adding a switch which allows arbitrary files to be read as ignores (basically just passing them to `add_custom_ignore_filename`)? I believe this is slightly cleaner while still resolving our use case (we can run with `--ignore-file-name .gitignore` which will add `.gitignore` as a custom ignore name, causing it to work outside of a git repository).\r\n\r\nThank you for your time and help! I have a prototype of the `--ignore-file-name` switch, but wanted to reach out to see which solution you thought was cleaner before putting up the PR.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nAlex","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/comments/548056131/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"akarle","id":11901959,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExOTAxOTU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11901959?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/akarle","html_url":"https://github.com/akarle","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akarle/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akarle/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akarle/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akarle/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akarle/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akarle/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akarle/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akarle/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akarle/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":2757210093,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50Mjc1NzIxMDA5Mw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/events/2757210093","actor":{"login":"BurntSushi","id":456674,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NjY3NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/456674?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi","html_url":"https://github.com/BurntSushi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-10-30T18:39:02Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2757210094,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDI3NTcyMTAwOTQ=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/events/2757210094","actor":{"login":"BurntSushi","id":456674,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NjY3NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/456674?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi","html_url":"https://github.com/BurntSushi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-10-30T18:39:02Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2757210097,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50Mjc1NzIxMDA5Nw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/events/2757210097","actor":{"login":"JohnC32","id":18011314,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MDExMzE0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18011314?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JohnC32","html_url":"https://github.com/JohnC32","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JohnC32/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JohnC32/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JohnC32/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JohnC32/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JohnC32/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JohnC32/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JohnC32/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JohnC32/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JohnC32/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-10-30T18:39:02Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2757210098,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDI3NTcyMTAwOTg=","url":"https://api.gith

That is an interesting approach, but it's not quite the same. In particular, `.gitignore` has _lower_ precedence that `.ignore` (and `.rgignore`). This is very much intentional, since it permits users to override `.gitignore` patterns with new patterns in `.ignore`. However, `add_custom_ignore_filename` specifically processes those files with the highest possible precedence, such that patterns in `.ignore` would no longer override it. This would be very confusing for users who would otherwise expect `.ignore` to override `.gitignore`.","author_association":"OWNER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/comments/548081409/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"BurntSushi","id":456674,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NjY3NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/456674?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi","html_url":"https://github.com/BurntSushi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":2757410737,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50Mjc1NzQxMDczNw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/events/2757410737","actor":{"login":"akarle","id":11901959,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExOTAxOTU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11901959?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/akarle","html_url":"https://github.com/akarle","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akarle/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akarle/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akarle/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akarle/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akarle/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akarle/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akarle/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akarle/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akarle/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-10-30T19:45:07Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2757410738,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDI3NTc0MTA3Mzg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/events/2757410738","actor":{"login":"akarle","id":11901959,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExOTAxOTU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11901959?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/akarle","html_url":"https://github.com/akarle","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akarle/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akarle/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akarle/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akarle/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akarle/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akarle/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akarle/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akarle/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akarle/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-10-30T19:45:07Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/comments/548091359","html_url":"https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/1414#issuecomment-548091359","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/1414","id":548091359,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU0ODA5MTM1OQ==","user":{"login":"akarle","id":11901959,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExOTAxOTU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11901959?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/akarle","html_url":"https://github.com/akarle","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akarle/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akarle/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akarle/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akarle/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akarle/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akarle/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akarle/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akarle/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akarle/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-10-30T20:11:10Z","updated_at":"2019-10-30T20:11:10Z","body":"@BurntSushi thank you for the fast response and for the clarification!\r\n\r\nHmm I was aware that it was a higher priority, but hadn't considered the impact of not allowing `.ignore` to override `.gitignore`.\r\n\r\nI had originally assumed that `.ignore` was for a different SCM system (maybe CVS), but I now see that appears to be without merit. Under this assumption, I hadn't considered users of `.gitignore`s to also be using `.ignore`.\r\n\r\nI now see that `.ignore` is a specific file used for search tools exclusively (rather than SCM systems). This makes much more sense, and I can see why we wouldn't want to override them with `--ignore-file-name .gitignore`.\r\n\r\nI'll look back into the original \"pay attention to .gitignore files

ignore crate has the concept of \"custom ignore\" files. These files\r\ntake precedence over all others and can be used to declare arbitrary\r\nfile names as files which should be parsed for ignore patterns.\r\n\r\nThis commit adds the `--ignore-file-name` switch to `ripgrep`, exposing this\r\nfunctionality to the user. For instance, if a user wanted to put their\r\nignores in many files called `.my_ignore` they could:\r\n\r\n    rg --ignore-file-name .my_ignore\r\n\r\nThis can also be used as a hack to honor `.gitignore` files outside .git\r\nrepositories (#1414), which can be useful if a git repo has been copied\r\nsomewhere without the .git directory (i.e. downloaded as a zip from\r\nGitHub) or for SCM systems like Perforce which allow `.gitignore` files\r\nbut are not valid git repositories. Note, however, that this tactic\r\ngives `.gitignore` precedence over `.ignore` and `.rgignore`, so consider\r\nusing multiple flags:\r\n\r\n    rg --ignore-file-name .ignore --ignore-file-name .gitignore\r\n\r\n-------\r\n\r\nAside: this is discussed in #1414 .\r\n\r\n@BurntSushi : I have another branch on my fork, [ignore_outside](https://github.com/akarle/ripgrep/commit/efbed3298e9a5c2383c91e084012e0cbbda9e2ff), that implements the other possible way we discussed of solving this (via a `--force-gitignore` flag, which I called `--ignore-outside-git`, but am happy to change to whatever we find appropriate).\r\n\r\nI also came up with a **third** solution that would work for our use-case: creating a `--alt-git-root-file` switch which specifies a token that is determined to indicate the root of a git repo. This is the most intrusive implementation though (getting into the guts of the `ignore` crate), and I found my knowledge of asynchronous rust didn't cut it :)\r\n\r\nI'm proposing we merge the `--ignore-file-name` switch, even though it is the most hacky solution to #1414 , because it is the least change to the code, and could have other benefits / be considered a feature. However, I'm happy to go with either the `--ignore-outside-git` or `--alt-git-repo-files` solutions if you deem them more appropriate for the project.\r\n\r\nRust is not my strongest language, so I appreciate any and all pointers / tips / corrections!\r\n\r\nThanks for your time and help!\r\nAlex","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/1416/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/1416/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":3044952760,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDMwNDQ5NTI3NjA=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/events/3044952760","actor":{"login":"BurntSushi","id":456674,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NjY3NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/456674?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi","html_url":"https://github.com/BurntSushi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"d0659282e65dde46e0b5f373d89042b2fe1d4884","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/commits/d0659282e65dde46e0b5f373d89042b2fe1d4884","created_at":"2020-02-17T20:36:24Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3045136796,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MzA0NTEzNjc5Ng==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/events/3045136796","actor":{"login":"BurntSushi","id":456674,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NjY3NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/456674?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi","html_url":"https://github.com/BurntSushi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":"711426a632aee0affb7009cd8e3492c4ff7273e8","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/commits/711426a632aee0affb7009cd8e3492c4ff7273e8","created_at":"2020-02-17T22:16:40Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/comments/1126852943","html_url":"https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/1414#issuecomment-1126852943","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/1414","id":1126852943,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAzJbyc5DKmlP","user":{"login":"Freed-Wu","id":32936898,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyOTM2ODk4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/32936898?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Freed-Wu","html_url":"https://github.com/Freed-Wu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Freed-Wu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Freed-Wu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Freed-Wu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Freed-Wu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Freed-Wu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Freed-Wu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Freed-Wu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Freed-Wu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Freed-Wu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-05-15T03:42:51Z","updated_at":"2022-05-15T03:42:51Z","body":"I try to compile rg and found it will test failure in no_require_git.

Problem\n\nClaude Code's Grep tool doesn't respect `.gitignore` files in Mercurial repositories because ripgrep by default only honors `.gitignore` when a `.git` directory is present.\n\nThis causes large amounts of unwanted results from directories like `node_modules/`, `vendor/`, `dist/`, etc. that would normally be filtered by `.gitignore` patterns.\n\n## Impact\n\nIn large monorepos (like Meta's fbsource which uses Mercurial) that uses .gitignore files, Grep searches return massive results from ignored directories:\n- Searches that should return ~10 files return 1000+ files\n- Search results include minified JavaScript, build artifacts, vendored code\n- This significantly impacts usability and performance\n\n## Root Cause\n\nRipgrep's default behavior requires a `.git` directory to respect `.gitignore` files. From the ripgrep documentation:\n\n> By default, ripgrep will only respect filter rules from source control ignore files when ripgrep detects that the search is executed inside a source control repository. For example, when a .git directory is observed.\n\nMercurial uses `.hg` directories, not `.git`, so `.gitignore` files are ignored.\n\n## Solution\n\nRipgrep added the `--no-require-git` flag specifically for this use case (see [ripgrep#1414](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/1414)).\n\nFrom ripgrep's help:\n```\n--no-require-git\n    When this flag is given, source control ignore files such as .gitignore\n    are respected even if no git repository is present.\n```\n\nClaude Code should pass `--no-require-git` when invoking ripgrep to support:\n1. Mercurial repositories that use `.gitignore` files\n2. Git repositories that have been archived/copied without `.git` directory\n3. Perforce repositories using `.gitignore` files\n4. Any repository structure using `.gitignore` for filtering\n\n## Workaround\n\nUsers can create a `.rgignore` file at the repository root with the same patterns as `.gitignore`. Ripgrep always respects `.rgignore` files regardless of repository type.\n\nHowever, this requires duplicating ignore rules and isn't a sustainable solution for large repositories with many `.gitignore` files.\n\n## Implementation\n\nThe fix should be straightforward - add `--no-require-git` to the ripgrep invocation in Claude Code's Grep tool.\n\n## Environment\n\n- Claude Code version: 2.0.13\n- Bundled ripgrep version: 14.1.1\n- Repository type: Mercurial (`.hg`)\n- Uses `.gitignore` files: Yes","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/anthropics/claude-code/issues/9411/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/anthropics/claude-code/issues/9411/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
