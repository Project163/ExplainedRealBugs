Haha aww shucks. FWIW, clap is unbelievably well maintained. I hadn't looked at it for a while, but when I checked it the other day I was completely blown away.\n\nTo give you more context: you probably won't notice much of a difference in standard usage. The problem appears specifically when there's a long list of positional file arguments. Docopt struggles with this because it uses a weird backtracking algorithm to match `argv` against its matcher. When `argv` is large, there's a _significant_ slow down. I doubt clap will even notice it at all.\n\nConverting `ripgrep` over to clap seems like a largeish undertaking, so please don't kill yourself over it! (In the sense that there's a lot of options, not in the sense that Docopt weirdness is spread throughout ripgrep.) I do kind of want to do it myself as a forcing function to get more familiar with clap, but I won't stop you. :-) I will note that this is kind of high on my priority list because it's really easy to provoke
