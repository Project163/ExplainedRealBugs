There's 2 concerns with this: 1) when using ripgrep, I don't really care about its opinion on the .gitignore files of another project 2) I'm assuming this means there's a behavior difference between real git and ripgrep's gitignore parsing.\r\n\r\nExamples:\r\n\r\n```\r\n./external/glide/.gitignore: line 24: error parsing glob '**local.properties': invalid use of **; must be one path component\r\n\r\n./external/chromium-trace/catapult/telemetry/bin/.gitignore: line 2: error parsing glob '!**.sha1': invalid use of **; must be one path component\r\n```\r\n\r\nI'm not sure what the correct solution here should be, but these error messages are not useful and obscure the real output.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/945/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/945/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
