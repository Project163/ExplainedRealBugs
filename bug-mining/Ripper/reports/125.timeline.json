to #568\r\n\r\nThis makes it so that options that take arguments which might conceivably begin with a leading hyphen actually accept arguments with leading hyphens. And it adds a test to make sure that works.\r\n\r\nIMO, `clap`'s default behaviour here is really undesirable. I guess it works the way it does because it wants to detect when a user might have given an option without giving a required argument to the previous one, but there's not really any reliable way to discern the user's intent. You're trading one assumption (the POSIX-style assumption that `-1` in `rg -C -1` is simply a bad argument to `-C`) for another one (the assumption that the user tried to use `-C` without giving it an argument at all). Neither one is more reliable than the other, but the POSIX-style assumption is more consistent and less surprising, i think.\r\n\r\nTo that end i tried simply setting [`AppSettings::AllowLeadingHyphen`](https://docs.rs/clap/2.24.0/clap/enum.AppSettings.html#variant.AllowLeadingHyphen) on the app to always override that behaviour, but it caused bizarre errors — for example, when i'd run `rg -M20 -C1` it would interpret `-C1` as the pattern operand for some reason.\r\n\r\nSo... as a compromise, i added the `ArgSettings` version to all of the options that accept an arbitrary string.
