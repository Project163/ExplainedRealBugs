You can see that some of the ^K's were counted as extra LF's (using rg.exe from ripgrep-0.2.1-x86_64-pc-windows-gnu.zip):\n\n```\n>\\Utils\\grep\\rg.exe -n x really_text.txt not_really_text.txt\nnot_really_text.txt\n8:x\n\nreally_text.txt\n5:x\n```\n\nI believe this problem can only happen on files with ^K in them.
