For example:\n\n```\n$ TERM=foobar rg --color=always PATTERN --debug\n```\n\nColors no longer work. The `--debug` flag might show a lot of other junk, but in my case, I do see this:\n\n```\nDEBUG:rg::out: error loading terminfo for coloring: could not find a terminfo entry for this terminal\n```\n\nIf I try this with GNU grep, colors still work, even if my `TERM` setting is nonsensical:\n\n```\nTERM=foobar grep --color=always PATTERN *\n```\n\nSo this could be one possible explanation. There may be other problems. For example, if `TERM` is unset:\n\n```\n$ unset TERM\n$ rg --color=always PATTERN --debug\n```\n\nIn the debug output, I see:\n\n```\nDEBUG:rg::out: error loading terminfo for coloring: TERM environment variable unset, unable to detect a terminal\n```\n\nOnce again, GNU grep still works. It seems GNU grep will fall back to some default settings that `ripgrep` doesn't do, and maybe we should do that. In the mean time, my strong suspicion is that something about your environment isn't configured correctly and GNU grep is bailing you out.\n\nSo, can you run `rg` with `--debug` and see if you can find the relevant error message? If not, you can just post the entire output. If that doesn't turn up anything, what is the value of `TERM` when `rg` is run? What about `TERMINFO`?\n\nThanks!\n","author_association":"OWNER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/comments/253984469/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"BurntSushi","id":456674,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NjY3NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/456674?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi","html_url":"https://github.com/BurntSushi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/comments/253985043","html_url":"https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/182#issuecomment-253985043","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/182","id":253985043,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI1Mzk4NTA0Mw==","user":{"login":"xuchunyang","id":4550353,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NTAzNTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4550353?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuchunyang","html_url":"https://github.com/xuchunyang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuchunyang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuchunyang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuchunyang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuchunyang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuchunyang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuchunyang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuchunyang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuchunyang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuchunyang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-10-15T13:43:28Z","updated_at":"2016-10-15T13:43:28Z","body":"`M-!

guess).\n","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/comments/254043067/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"ticki","id":13349091,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMzQ5MDkx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13349091?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ticki","html_url":"https://github.com/ticki","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ticki/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ticki/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ticki/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ticki/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ticki/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ticki/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ticki/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ticki/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ticki/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":825090086,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50ODI1MDkwMDg2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/events/825090086","actor":{"login":"BurntSushi","id":456674,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NjY3NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/456674?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi","html_url":"https://github.com/BurntSushi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2016-10-16T12:05:07Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":825090087,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDgyNTA5MDA4Nw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/events/825090087","actor":{"login":"BurntSushi","id":456674,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NjY3NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/456674?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi","html_url":"https://github.com/BurntSushi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2016-10-16T12:05:07Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/comments/254048312","html_url":"https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/182#issuecomment-254048312","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/182","id":254048312,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI1NDA0ODMxMg==","user":{"login":"BurntSushi","id":456674,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NjY3NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/456674?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi","html_url":"https://github.com/BurntSushi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-10-16T13:54:17Z","updated_at":"2016-10-16T13:54:17

Got ya. Given that every other tool in this space seems to not care about `TERMINFO`, it seems OK for `ripgrep` to do the same. With that in mind, I'd like to switch Unix handling to using `termion`, which I think should be straight-forward.\n\nI would definitely recommend treading carefully with Windows. For Windows, you need to make _synchronous_ API calls to the console you're writing to, which means that you can't really implement Windows support in some arbitrary formatter that can write to anything. For `ripgrep`, this is particularly bad because we want to write matches to an in memory buffer and only actually print them later. There are a couple ways of doing this, including writing an ANSI interpreter, but I opted for something simpler but just as hacky: https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/blob/master/src/terminal_win.rs\n\nWhat I'm saying is: as a future user of `termion`, I don't expect you to support Windows for this. I expect to be subjected to grueling pain. :-)\n","author_association":"OWNER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/comments/254048312/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"BurntSushi","id":456674,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NjY3NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/456674?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi","html_url":"https://github.com/BurntSushi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":825111112,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50ODI1MTExMTEy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/events/825111112","actor":{"login":"ticki","id":13349091,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMzQ5MDkx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13349091?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ticki","html_url":"https://github.com/ticki","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ticki/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ticki/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ticki/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ticki/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ticki/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ticki/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ticki/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ticki/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ticki/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2016-10-16T13:54:17Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":825111113,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDgyNTExMTExMw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/events/825111113","actor":{"login":"ticki","id":13349091,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMzQ5MDkx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13349091?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ticki","html_url":"https://github.com/ticki","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ticki/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ticki/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ticki/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ticki/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ticki/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ticki/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ticki/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ticki/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ticki/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2016-10-16T13:54:17Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/comments/254065103","html_url":"https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/182#issuecomment-254065103","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/182","id":254065103,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI1NDA2NTEwMw==","user":{"login":"ticki","id":13349091,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMzQ5MDkx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13349091?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ticki","html_url":"https://github.com/ticki","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ticki/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ticki/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ticki/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ticki/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ticki/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ticki/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ticki/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ticki/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ticki/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-10-16T18:37:45Z","updated_at":"2016-10-16T18:37:45Z","body":"@BurntSushi I agree with that.
