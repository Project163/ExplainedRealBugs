All it does is control the number of times it descends into a directory. If the value is zero, then it will _never_ descend into any directories.

know of at least one Windows user who wants this pretty badly. (cc @retep998) It sounds like the claim is that, on Windows at least, defining aliases and/or wrapper scripts is neither common nor convenient to do. Is this others' experience as well? Could someone please outline exactly what one has to do on Windows to create a wrapper script? Is it really an unreasonable expectation?\r\n\r\nIf we go down this path, we should consider the following:\r\n\r\n* Whether `clap` can give this to us for free some day: https://github.com/kbknapp/clap-rs/issues/748\r\n* If clap doesn't, then we need to come up with our own specification.\r\n* For example, where are config files read from? On *nix, I'm familiar with the xdg basedir specification, so we could follow that, but I don't know what the idioms are on Windows.\r\n* We may need to solve problems like \"I set `--context 5` in my config file, but I want to override occasionally with `--context 0` on the command line.\" We can't just trivially merge the config with the CLI parameters since `rg --context 5 --context 0 foo` is illegal today. This is probably true of several other flags, and many other flags probably need the opposites added. e.g., If `--no-ignore` is in the config file, how does a user re-enable ignore functionality?\r\n\r\nIMO, the above implies *significant* complexity and likely an easy source of bugs. If we moved forward with this, I think I'd have to demand a rock solid specification (which I'm not inclined to work on any time soon) or some kind of conscious concessions at least (like, \"not every option is overridable,\" for example, which seems like bad UX honestly).","author_association":"OWNER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/comments/262853109/reactions","total_count":6,"+1":6,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"BurntSushi","id":456674,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NjY3NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/456674?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi","html_url":"https://github.com/BurntSushi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":871520359,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50ODcxNTIwMzU5","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/events/871520359","actor":{"login":"retep998","id":666308,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2NjMwOA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/666308?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/retep998","html_url":"https://github.com/retep998","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/retep998/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/retep998/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/retep998/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/retep998/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/retep998/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/retep998/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/retep998/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/retep998/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/retep998/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2016-11-24T22:49:29Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":871520360,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDg3MTUyMDM2MA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/events/871520360","actor":{"login":"retep998","id":666308,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2NjMwOA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/666308?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/retep998","html_url":"https://github.com/retep998","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/retep998/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/retep998/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/retep998/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/retep998/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/retep998/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/retep998/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/retep998/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/retep998/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/retep998/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2016-11-24T22:49:29Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"actor":{"login":"BurntSushi","id":456674,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NjY3NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/456674?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi","html_url":"https://github.com/BurntSushi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-11-24T22:51:39Z","updated_at":"2016-11-24T22:51:39Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/clap-rs/clap/issues/748","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/clap-rs/clap","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/clap-rs/clap/issues/748/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/clap-rs
