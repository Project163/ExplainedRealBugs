Both `ag` and `ack` have `-L`/`--files-without-matches` (effectively the opposite of `-l`/`--files-with-matches`).\n\nOne minor problem here is that `rg -L` is already taken for following symlinks.\n\nCuriously, `ag -lv` appears to be a synonym of `-L`. I'm not sure whether this is intentional or not, but it seems like a perfectly reasonable approach to me — in fact, years ago, before I knew of `-L`, this is actually what I first tried with `ack`, and got bogus results (it interprets this combo as \"list all files that have at least one line that does not match the given expression\", like ripgrep does today). Personally, I don't think I've ever had a use case for this.\n","closed_by":{"login":"BurntSushi","id":456674,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NjY3NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/456674?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi","html_url":"https://github.com/BurntSushi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/138/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/138/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
