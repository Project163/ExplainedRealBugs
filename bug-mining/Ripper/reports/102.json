In my estimation, this is probably good enough for the vast majority of use cases.\n\nHowever, it may be useful to search other encodings. I don't think I'd be willing to, say, modify the regex engine itself to support other encodings, but if it were easy to do transcoding on the fly, then I think it wouldn't add too much complexity. The [`encoding_rs`](https://github.com/hsivonen/encoding_rs) project in particular appears to support this type of text decoding.\n\nSome thoughts/concerns:\n- Transcoding would require using the incremental searcher as opposed to the memory map searcher. (Which is fine.)\n- Transcoding requires picking a source encoding, and doing this seems non-trivial. You might imagine the CLI growing a new flag that specifies a text encoding, but what happens if you want to search directories containing files with many different types of text encodings? Do we need a more elaborate system? I'm inclined towards not, since I think the juice probably isn't worth the squeeze.\n","closed_by":{"login":"BurntSushi","id":456674,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NjY3NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/456674?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi","html_url":"https://github.com/BurntSushi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/1/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/1/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
