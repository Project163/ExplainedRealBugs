GNU grep has this\r\n\r\n```\r\n       -b, --byte-offset\r\n              Print the 0-based byte offset within the  input  file  before  each  line  of  output.   If  -o\r\n              (--only-matching) is specified, print the offset of the matching part itself.\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nI have a process that generates terabytes of diagnostic output daily. I desire to scan all that\r\nfor certain patterns and then to have a script read forward from the lines the patterns are on.\r\nIt would be much faster to fseek() to the offset of each matching line than to read all the data\r\ncounting lines. rg would be the perfect tool for generating the list of interesting offsets if it offered\r\nthat functionality.
