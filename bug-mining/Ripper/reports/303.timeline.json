you can see that when you run in the MSYS shell, that the _actual_ regex that ripgrep searches is `C:/msys64/example`, despite the fact that you typed in `/example`.\r\n\r\nAs far as I'm concerned, this is just crazy behavior from MSYS in assuming that any argument given to a command line program is a file path, and I don't see any reasonable way for ripgrep to fix this.\r\n\r\nIt is interesting to me that grep doesn't exhibit the same behavior, but your version of grep is likely bundled with MSYS in a way that makes it play nice with this automatic path translation behavior. I don't see an easy way for ripgrep to play along here.\r\n\r\nUnfortunate, but this is a `wontfix`. As a workaround, I believe you can use `//example` as a way to \"escape\" the
