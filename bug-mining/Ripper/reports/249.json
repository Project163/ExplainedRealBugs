I created an UTF-16 LE file with text `test` (hexdump)\r\n```\r\n00000000: fffe 7400 6500 7300 7400 0a00            ..t.e.s.t...\r\n```\r\nGiven that there are 00 bytes inside I'm issuing a command `rg -cuuu '(?-u:\\x00)'` but get no results at all. It works for searching for `t`, like \r\n```\r\nrg -cuuu '(?-u:\\x73)'\r\ntest.txt:1\r\n```\r\nFrom my understanding the `-uuu` flag along with some UTF escaping should do the trick. It works fine for non-zero bytes. It also works for binary files (tried with a file comprising of a single 00 byte). Am I missing something?","closed_by":{"login":"BurntSushi","id":456674,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NjY3NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/456674?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi","html_url":"https://github.com/BurntSushi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/1207/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/1207/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
