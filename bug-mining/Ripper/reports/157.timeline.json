That is, shutting TBM off fixes the issue. The above unit test was derived by widdling down the example corpus given in https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/781\r\n\r\nI've tried to fix this myself, but the code is dense. As best I can tell, the md2 shift is wrong, or this is hitting up into a boundary condition with respect to the backstop (more likely?). That is, this particular case enters the `memchr` skip routine, which uses `_` as its guard char. This takes `window_end` from `12` to `44`, which is positioned at the `l` in `clone_created`. This then fails `check_match` (which seems correct), but this in turn causes the `md2_shift` (which is `12`) to get added to the `window_end` index, which causes the code to skip ahead too far and miss the match.\r\n\r\nThe part that doesn't make sense to me here is the relationship between `check_match` and the `md2_shift`. Namely, `check_match` appears to be used as a guard against whether `md2_shift` is used. If the match fails, then the code assumes we can skip `md2_shift` bytes. It almost seems like the case analysis is a little off. For example, this code seems to fix this particular bug:\r\n\r\n```rust\r\n                if self.check_match(haystack, window_end) {\r\n                    return Some(window_end - (self.pattern.len() - 1));\r\n                } else if window_end + self.md2_shift >= backstop {\r\n                    break;\r\n                } else {\r\n                    window_end += self.md2_shift;\r\n                    continue;\r\n                }\r\n```\r\n\r\nbut I didn't arrive to this code in a principled way, so I'm not confident in it. It feels like to me the very fact that the `md2_shift` could overshoot the match is the problem, but it's less clear how to fix that.\r\n\r\n@ethanpailes Do you have any ideas here? I am probably going to disable TBM for now  because of this bug. Would it make sense to use a more traditional TBM variant where we don't use frequency analysis but instead always skip based on the last byte?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/regex/issues/446/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/regex/issues/446/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":1465697108,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MTQ2NTY5NzEwOA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/events/1465697108","actor":{"login":"BurntSushi","id":456674,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NjY3NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/456674?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi","html_url":"https://github.com/BurntSushi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":"8e93fa0e7fecf375e03d398660eb0e9ba7cf3473","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/commits/8e93fa0e7fecf375e03d398660eb0e9ba7cf3473","created_at":"2018-02-08T23:26:51Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
