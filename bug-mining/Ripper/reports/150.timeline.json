#761\r\n\r\nThis is kind of a scary change, but it *seems* right...?\r\n\r\nPer the unit tests, the `ignore` crate assumes that `bar/*.rs` should match both `bar/main.rs` and `foo/bar/main.rs`. However, the `gitignore` documentation seems to state very clearly that it should *not* behave this way:\r\n\r\n>Otherwise [if the pattern contains a slash], Git treats the pattern as a shell glob suitable for consumption by fnmatch(3) with the FNM_PATHNAME flag: wildcards in the pattern will not match a / in the pathname. **For example, \"Documentation/*.html\" matches \"Documentation/git.html\" but not \"Documentation/ppc/ppc.html\" or \"tools/perf/Documentation/perf.html\".**\r\n\r\nThe real-world behaviour of git 2.16.1 is consistent with this.\r\n\r\nLooking at the `ignore` unit tests, the test patterns borrowed from [behnam/gitignore-test](https://github.com/behnam/gitignore-test) seem to have made this assumption as well:\r\n\r\n```\r\n# NO_MATCH\r\ndir_deep_02/*\r\n\r\n# NO_MATCH\r\ndir_deep_03/**\r\n```\r\n\r\nBoth patterns say `NO_MATCH`, but the unit tests designed for them *do* in fact expect a match. I don't see any comments anywhere that explain why it should be different, so i'm guessing it wasn't an intentional design decision or anything.\r\n\r\nAnyway, *without* this change, if you check out the `gitignore-test` repo, build the file tree, and then compare `rg --files` to `git add . && git status`, you'll see that `rg` is missing the two matches for those directories. *With* the change, they both match exactly the same files.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/762/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":1,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/762/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":1447033455,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MTQ0NzAzMzQ1NQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/events/1447033455","actor":{"login":"BurntSushi","id":456674,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NjY3NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/456674?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi","html_url":"https://github.com/BurntSushi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-01-29T19:11:00Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":1447033510,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDE0NDcwMzM1MTA=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/events/1447033510","actor":{"login":"BurntSushi","id":456674,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NjY3NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/456674?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi","html_url":"https://github.com/BurntSushi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"51864c13fc329332b9ebcf2a7e45e7b6aadeedbd","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/commits/51864c13fc329332b9ebcf2a7e45e7b6aadeedbd","created_at":"2018-01-29T19:11:02Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"actor":{"login":"BurntSushi","id":456674,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NjY3NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/456674?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi","html_url":"https://github.com/BurntSushi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-02-22T22:25:32Z","updated_at":"2018-02-22T22:25:32Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/830","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/830/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/830/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/830/events","html_url":"https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/830","id":299499612,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWUyOTk0OTk2MTI=","number":830,"title":"rg
