Unfortunately, the current binaries don't include an ARM compatible release. Additionally, the process for cross-compiling with Rust from OSX to ARM seems [more complicated than I anticipated](https://github.com/Ragnaroek/rust-on-raspberry-docker) (at least compared to Go), and installing Rust on the Pi seems like a little more work than I'd hope for just to be able to install ripgrep.\r\n\r\nIf there's any way the `armv7-unknown-linux-gnueabihf` target could be added as one of the binaries you provide for easy download, I bet it would see a decent amount of use from fellow Raspberry Pi users.  As someone unfamiliar with Rust, trying to figure out rustup and cross compiling is currently taking up a lot of my day, and a simple `wget` and `tar xzf` certainly sounds appealing.","closed_by":{"login":"BurntSushi","id":456674,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NjY3NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/456674?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi","html_url":"https://github.com/BurntSushi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/676/reactions","total_count":8,"+1":8,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/676/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
