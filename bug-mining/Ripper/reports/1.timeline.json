What version of ripgrep are you using?\r\nripgrep 0.10.0 (rev 8a7db1a918)\r\n-SIMD -AVX (compiled)\r\n+SIMD +AVX (runtime)\r\n\r\n#### How did you install ripgrep?\r\n\r\nPrecompiled msvc binary for Windows-x64\r\n\r\n#### What operating system are you using ripgrep on?\r\n\r\nWindows 7, some current pach level\r\n\r\n#### Describe your question, feature request, or bug.\r\n\r\nIf I redirect the ripgrep output to a file on windows, the memory usage of `rg.exe` increases slowly but steady, probably with each found element.\r\nAfter a few GB, `rg.exe` then crashes with a segmentation fault.\r\nInside `procmon`, I see the results seem to only be flushed to the file after the crash.\r\nA workaround is to force single threading with `-j1`. This seems to be directly related to [this old issue](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/4) \r\n\r\nOr are the reads and hits simply too fast to be written to disk if multi threaded?\r\n\r\n#### If this is a bug, what are the steps to reproduce the behavior?\r\n\r\nTrying to extract all mail addresses from a large current password leak with 130k files, 8k folders and 1.62TB in total (with different filessizes) crashes rg.\r\n\r\nInside git bash, run:\r\n```\r\n$ ./rg.exe -uu --no-filename -o '[a-zA-Z0-9.%&’*+/=?^_`{}~-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9-]+(?:\\.[a-zA-Z0-9-]+)*' ./Passwords/ > all_mails.txt\r\n```\r\nFor obvious reasons, I cannot include the corpus here.\r\n\r\n#### If this is a bug, what is the actual behavior?\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ ./rg.exe --debug -uu --no-filename -o '[a-zA-Z0-9.%&’*+/=?^_`{}~-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9-]+(?:\\.[a-zA-Z0-9-]+)*' ./Passwords/ > all_mails.txt\r\nDEBUG|grep_regex::literal|grep-regex\\src\\literal.rs:110: required literal found: \"@\"\r\nDEBUG|globset|globset\\src\\lib.rs:429: built glob set; 0 literals, 0 basenames, 8 extensions, 0 prefixes, 0 suffixes, 0 required extensions, 0 regexes\r\nDEBUG|globset|globset\\src\\lib.rs:429: built glob set; 0 literals, 0 basenames, 8 extensions, 0 prefixes, 0 suffixes, 0 required extensions, 0 regexes\r\nDEBUG|globset|globset\\src\\lib.rs:429: built glob set; 0 literals, 0 basenames, 8 extensions, 0 prefixes, 0 suffixes, 0 required extensions, 0 regexes\r\nDEBUG|globset|globset\\src\\lib.rs:429: built glob set; 0 literals, 0 basenames, 8 extensions, 0 prefixes, 0 suffixes, 0 required extensions, 0 regexes\r\nDEBUG|globset|globset\\src\\lib.rs:429: built glob set; 0 literals, 0 basenames, 8 extensions, 0 prefixes, 0 suffixes, 0 required extensions, 0 regexes\r\nmemory allocation of 5795684597665262959 bytes failedSegmentation fault\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### If this is a bug, what is the expected behavior?\r\n\r\nThe user should be able to `rg` multi-threaded on any kind of large dataset.\r\nMaybe a synchronization point when the buffer gets too big or the choice to disable caching (I don't need the output in order, for example) could be options.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/1189/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/1189/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
