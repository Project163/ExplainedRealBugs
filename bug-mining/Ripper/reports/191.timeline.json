If you only care about supporting Windows 10 or newer, then you have a lot more choices.\r\n\r\n> For discoverability, should termcolor move to a separate repository?\r\n\r\nNot sure. The issue volume for termcolor is quite low. The reason why it (and the other crates) are in the ripgrep repo is because it simplifies maintenance for me, which I attach a lot of value to.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure that there's too much else left to do for termcolor anyway. It will never grow beyond very basic color/styling support. It's probably ripe for a 1.0 release.","author_association":"OWNER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/comments/390755494/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"BurntSushi","id":456674,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NjY3NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/456674?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi","html_url":"https://github.com/BurntSushi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":1637734785,"node_id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDE2Mzc3MzQ3ODU=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/events/1637734785","actor":{"login":"BurntSushi","id":456674,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NjY3NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/456674?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi","html_url":"https://github.com/BurntSushi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-05-21T19:22:15Z","label":{"name":"question","color":"cc317c"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/comments/398818385","html_url":"https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/924#issuecomment-398818385","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/924","id":398818385,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM5ODgxODM4NQ==","user":{"login":"gilescope","id":803976,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgwMzk3Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/803976?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gilescope","html_url":"https://github.com/gilescope","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gilescope/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gilescope/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gilescope/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gilescope/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gilescope/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gilescope/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gilescope/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gilescope/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gilescope/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-06-20T16:45:42Z","updated_at":"2018-06-20T16:45:42Z","body":"I was using ripgrep on the default powershell terminal which has a blue background.
