small outputs it looks like `rg` can write all of it's output to `less`' buffer and exit. If the full output is too large `rg` seems to spin waiting for `less` to allocate a larger buffer. If you run to the end of the output and leave `less` running `rg` will exit and of course CPU usage drops off.\r\n\r\nEDIT: Could it also be very long lines in the output?

turns out that \"noodling\" on this problem was exactly what was needed.\r\n\r\nI ended up figuring out how to produce this. Basically, it happens whenever you:\r\n\r\n1. Pipe the output of ripgrep into a pager (or otherwise cause writes to `stdout` to block).\r\n2. The number of directories to search is less than the number of threads ripgrep uses.\r\n\r\nThe issue here is that when one thread blocks on writing to `stdout` *and* there is no more work to be done, then the rest of the worker threads will *spin* on the multi-producer multi-consumer queue and therefore burn the CPU. (We don't use a blocking queue because we don't really know when directory traversal is finished.) I fixed this by inserting a very short sleep whenever a worker can't get work from the queue. This still pegs the CPU a bit, but it is much much less than before.\r\n\r\nThis also caused me to realized another shortcoming of the existing iterator. It was running searches for all direct children of a directory in the same thread. So if you ran ripgrep on a single directory with lots of files, you wouldn't get any parallelism!
