If you run rg with --no-mmap (--mmap does\nthe opposite) then it will avoid using memory maps and instead use standard\nfile APIs. Linux, for example, has an issue where virtual files can't be\nmemory mapped. ripgrep detects this by looking at file size. If the size is\nzero (which is what virtual files like /proc/cpuinfo report), then it\nforcefully disables use of memory maps and everything works.\n\nIf memory maps are indeed the problem, and if there is a way to tell that\nmemory maps won't work with a stat call or similar then we can change\nripgrep's heuristics on Windows.\n\nIf this isn't the problem, then I personally would probably try to\nreproduce the problem using a minimal Rust program, and then start\ndiagnosing from there. If it comes to that, how easy would it be for me to\nreproduce the bug on my own Windows machine?\n\nOn Dec 3, 2017 9:58 PM, \"Rob Lourens\" <notifications@github.com> wrote:\n\n> Ref: Microsoft/vscode#35433\n> <https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/35433>\n>\n> Files On Demand is a new OneDrive feature that only downloads files to the\n> local disk when needed.

this would fix https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/46484\r\n\r\nThe current iteration of this PR should not cause existing code to break, but instead merely improves handling around reparse points. Specifically...\r\n\r\n* Reparse points are considered to be symbolic links if they have the name surrogate bit set. Name surrogates are reparse points that effectively act like symbolic links, redirecting you to a different directory/file. By checking for this bit instead of specific tags, we become much more general in our handling of reparse points, including those added by third parties.\r\n* If something is a reparse point but does not have the name surrogate bit set, then we ignore the fact that it is a reparse point because it is actually a file or directory directly there, despite having additional handling by drivers due to the reparse point.\r\n* For everything which is not a symbolic link (including non-surrogate reparse points) we report whether it is a directory or a file based on the presence of the directory attribute bit.\r\n* Notably this still preserves invariant that when `is_symlink` returns `true`, both `is_dir` and `is_file` will return `false`. The potential for breakage was far too high.\r\n* Adds an unstable `FileTypeExt` to allow users to determine whether a symbolic link is a directory or a file, since `FileType` by design is incapable of reporting this information.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/47956/reactions","total_count":37,"+1":8,"-1":0,"laugh":20,"hooray":5,"confused":0,"heart":4,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rust-lang/rust/issues/47956/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/comments/363313008","html_url":"https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/705#issuecomment-363313008","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/705","id":363313008,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM2MzMxMzAwOA==","user":{"login":"roblourens","id":323878,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyMzg3OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/323878?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/roblourens","html_url":"https://github.com/roblourens","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roblourens/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roblourens/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roblourens/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roblourens/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roblourens/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roblourens/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roblourens/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roblourens/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roblourens/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":true},"created_at":"2018-02-06T05:12:12Z","updated_at":"2018-02-06T05:12:24Z","body":"This works great.
