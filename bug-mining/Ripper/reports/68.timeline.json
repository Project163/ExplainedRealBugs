It seems like this is intended behaviour, at least to some extent, but it's undeniably unintuitive that `somelink` and `somelink/` act differently. Maybe a fix would be to traverse symbolic links for all input paths, but then respect `--follow` when walking the resultant paths, but that might not play nice with globbing (like, you might accidentally end up traversing symlinks and causing a loop, and have no way to disable that without manually excluding the path).\r\n\r\nI'd just make it so that it displays a better message, something like `somelink: is a symlinked directory - run again with --follow to traverse symbolic links`.

Yeah, I'll get on it now. I was wondering whether you'd hang on opening if you had a recursive set of links (i.e. not a directory that _contains_ a link to itself, but a link that transitively links to itself) but it looks like the Linux kernel just throws an exception. I don't know what the behaviour is on other operating systems (*BSD, Windows, OS X) but I'd guess that at best it's the same and at worst it's not considered to be a problem for the application developer.
