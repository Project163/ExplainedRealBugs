\"right\" and who should be providing these completions:\r\n\r\n- I'm guessing it should be ripgrep...\r\n- ... but fish providing the completions means users with improper ripgrep installations (for example users who just dropped the binary in $PATH) will still get completions.\r\n- If fish keeps shipping completions, a simple \"fix\" for the AUR package would be to add to `package()` a little `rm \"$pkgdir/usr/share/fish/completions/rg.fish\"`\r\n\r\nAnyway, you already provide tons of completions, so I guess you already know what's the right thing to do here.

Do you really think it's worth needling me about how I schedule my free time to do a release? I don't. I mean, I wrote the policy. I linked the FAQ entry. Obviously I'm telling you that it applies. Moreover, this isn't some written-in-stone-law that I have to obey. I made the language in the FAQ purposely vague to try to avoid people trying to lawyer me over it. I've now made it even more vague: https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/commit/ecec6147d117da638c933cf103a3ea14ce87102d\r\n\r\nIn any case, no, I do not see this as a high impact bug. First of all, this isn't a regression. Nothing changed in the last release that made this a problem. Something else outside of my control appears to have changed. Second of all, my fix _only_ applies to the ripgrep binary Debian package that I distribute. This fix does nothing to resolve any problems ripgrep may or may not have with other packages. If you all of a sudden can't install the binary Debian package, then you can download the generic binary releases until the next release comes out. Or build the binary Debian package from source. Or, if you're using Debian, use whatever release of ripgrep is in the Debian repos. Or, it looks like @zanchey posted a work-around (thank you for that).","author_association":"OWNER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/comments/589960154/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"BurntSushi","id":456674,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NjY3NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/456674?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi","html_url":"https://github.com/BurntSushi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":3062749178,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MzA2Mjc0OTE3OA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/events/3062749178","actor":{"login":"zanchey","id":520741,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyMDc0MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/520741?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zanchey","html_url":"https://github.com/zanchey","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zanchey/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zanchey/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zanchey/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zanchey/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zanchey/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zanchey/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zanchey/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zanchey/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zanchey/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-02-22T14:15:19Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3062749180,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDMwNjI3NDkxODA=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/events/3062749180","actor":{"login":"zanchey","id":520741,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyMDc0MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/520741?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zanchey","html_url":"https://github.com/zanchey","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zanchey/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zanchey/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zanchey/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zanchey/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zanchey/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zanchey/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zanchey/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zanchey/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zanchey/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-02-22T14:15:19Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3062749181,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MzA2Mjc0OTE4MQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/events/3062749181","actor":{"login":"thernstig","id":30827238,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwODI3MjM4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/30827238?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/thernstig","html_url":"https://github.com/thernstig","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thernstig/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thernstig/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thernstig/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thernstig/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thernstig/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thernstig/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thernstig/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thernstig/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thernstig/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-02-22T14:15:19Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3062749182,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDMwNjI3NDkxODI=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi
