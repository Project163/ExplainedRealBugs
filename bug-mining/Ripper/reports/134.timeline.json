This is definitely a bug. But I don't think it has anything to do with *precedence* specifically. For example:\r\n\r\n```\r\n[andrew@Cheetah ripgrep-402] cat > rgtest.txt <<EOF\r\n> a\r\n> b\r\n> c\r\n> d\r\n> e\r\n> a\r\n> b\r\n> c\r\n> d\r\n> e\r\n> EOF\r\n[andrew@Cheetah ripgrep-402] rg -C2 c -m1 rgtest.txt\r\n1-a\r\n2-b\r\n3:c\r\n[andrew@Cheetah ripgrep-402] rg -C2 c -m2 rgtest.txt\r\n1-a\r\n2-b\r\n3:c\r\n4-d\r\n5-e\r\n6-a\r\n7-b\r\n8:c\r\n```\r\n\r\nNotice that in the last example, the \"after\" context for the first match is printed correctly. Only the last match loses it.\r\n\r\nThis is probably just a bug in the search code where it neglects to print the context after the last match if it decides to quit early. I'll note that `grep` handles this correctly:\r\n\r\n```\r\n[andrew@Cheetah ripgrep-402] grep -C2 c -m2 rgtest.txt\r\na\r\nb\r\nc\r\nd\r\ne\r\na\r\nb\r\nc\r\nd\r\ne\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis _could_ be a little tricky to fix.

sure.","author_association":"OWNER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/comments/285650985/reactions","total_count":3,"+1":3,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"BurntSushi","id":456674,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NjY3NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/456674?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi","html_url":"https://github.com/BurntSushi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":994774547,"node_id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDk5NDc3NDU0Nw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/events/994774547","actor":{"login":"BurntSushi","id":456674,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NjY3NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/456674?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi","html_url":"https://github.com/BurntSushi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2017-03-10T11:54:39Z","label":{"name":"bug","color":"fc2929"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":994774548,"node_id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDk5NDc3NDU0OA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/events/994774548","actor":{"login":"BurntSushi","id":456674,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NjY3NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/456674?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi","html_url":"https://github.com/BurntSushi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2017-03-10T11:54:39Z","label":{"name":"libripgrep","color":"e99695"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":994774581,"node_id":"MDE1Ok1pbGVzdG9uZWRFdmVudDk5NDc3NDU4MQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/events/994774581","actor":{"login":"BurntSushi","id":456674,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NjY3NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/456674?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi","html_url":"https://github.com/BurntSushi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"milestoned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2017-03-10T11:54:41Z","

What version of ripgrep are you using?\r\n\r\nripgrep 11.0.2\r\n-SIMD -AVX (compiled)\r\n+SIMD -AVX (runtime)\r\n\r\n#### How did you install ripgrep?\r\n\r\nGithub binary release\r\n\r\n#### What operating system are you using ripgrep on?\r\n\r\nLinux, RHEL 7.7\r\n\r\n#### Describe your question, feature request, or bug.\r\n\r\nUnexpected behavior when combining --max-count with --context, if there are additional matches in the context. This is not really a bug, more like inconsistent behavior.\r\n\r\nI am searching for the first match in one file and want to print the next _n_ lines.\r\nIf there are no additional matches in the context, then the search output stops after the first result and prints the next _n_ lines.\r\nIf there is an additional match within the next _n_ lines, then (it seems like) rg treats this as a match and restarts its internal context line counter, printing an additional _n_ lines. \r\n\r\nI am aware that --max-count is a limit on per-line matches. But it _works_ for some input files and it does not work for some other files, which is unexpected. Also, it appears somewhat similar to #402.\r\n\r\n#### If this is a bug, what are the steps to reproduce the behavior?\r\n```\r\n> cat rgtest.txt\r\na\r\nb\r\nc\r\nd\r\ne\r\nd\r\ne\r\nd\r\ne\r\nd\r\ne\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### If this is a bug, what is the actual behavior?\r\n\r\nWorking as expected: Print first result and next line:\r\n```\r\n> rg -m 1 -A 1 d rgtest.txt\r\n4:d\r\n5-e\r\n```\r\nWorking as expected: Do \"print first result and next line\" twice:\r\n```\r\n> rg -m 2 -A 1 d rgtest.txt\r\n4:d\r\n5-e\r\n6:d\r\n7-e\r\n```\r\n\r\nUnexpected: Print first result and next two lines\r\n```\r\n> rg -m 1 -A 2 d rgtest.txt\r\n4:d\r\n5-e\r\n6:d\r\n7-e\r\n8:d\r\n9-e\r\n10:d\r\n11-e\r\n12-\r\n```\r\nExpected result:\r\n```\r\n4:d\r\n5-e\r\n6:d\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### If this is a bug, what is the expected behavior?\r\nNot a bug, but a wish for consistency (i.e. _please fix it for my specific use case_)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/1380/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/1380/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
