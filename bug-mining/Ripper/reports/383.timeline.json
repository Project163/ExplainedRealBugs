by `brew bump`\n\n---\n\nCreated with `brew bump-formula-pr`.<details>\n  <summary>release notes</summary>\n  <pre>ripgrep 14 is a new major version release of ripgrep that has some new\r\nfeatures, performance improvements and a lot of bug fixes.\r\n\r\n> In case you haven't heard of it before, ripgrep is a line-oriented search\r\n> tool that recursively searches the current directory for a regex pattern.\r\n> By default, ripgrep will respect gitignore rules and automatically skip\r\n> hidden files/directories and binary files.\r\n\r\nThe headling feature in this release is hyperlink support. In this release,\r\nthey are an opt-in feature but may change to an opt-out feature in the future.\r\nTo enable them, try passing `--hyperlink-format default`. If you use [VS Code],\r\nthen try passing `--hyperlink-format vscode`. Please [report your experience\r\nwith hyperlinks][report-hyperlinks], positive or negative.\r\n\r\n[VS Code]: https://code.visualstudio.com/\r\n[report-hyperlinks]: https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/discussions/2611\r\n\r\nAnother headling development in this release is that it contains a rewrite of\r\nits regex engine. You generally shouldn't notice any changes, except for some\r\nsearches may get faster. You can read more about the [regex engine rewrite on\r\nmy blog][regex-internals]. Please [report your performance improvements or\r\nregressions that you notice][report-perf].\r\n\r\n[report-perf]: https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/discussions/2652\r\n\r\nFinally, ripgrep switched the library it uses for argument parsing. Users\r\nshould not notice a difference in most cases (error messages have changed\r\nsomewhat), but flag overrides should generally be more consistent. For example,\r\nthings like `--no-ignore --ignore-vcs` work as one would expect (disables all\r\nfiltering related to ignore rules except for rules found in version control\r\nsystems such as `git`).\r\n\r\n[regex-internals]: https://blog.burntsushi.net/regex-internals/\r\n\r\n**BREAKING CHANGES**:\r\n\r\n* `rg -C1 -A2` used to be equivalent to `rg -A2`, but now it is equivalent to\r\n  `rg -B1 -A2`. That is, `-A` and `-B` no longer completely override `-C`.\r\n  Instead, they only partially override `-C`.\r\n\r\nBuild process changes:\r\n\r\n* ripgrep's shell completions and man page are now created by running ripgrep\r\nwith a new `--generate` flag. For example, `rg --generate man` will write a\r\nman page in `roff` format on stdout. The release archives have not changed.\r\n* The optional build dependency on `asciidoc` or `asciidoctor` has been\r\ndropped. Previously, it was used to produce ripgrep's man page. ripgrep now\r\nowns this process itself by writing `roff` directly.\r\n\r\nPerformance improvements:\r\n\r\n* [PERF #1746](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/1746):\r\n  Make some cases with inner literals faster.\r\n* [PERF #1760](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/1760):\r\n  Make most
