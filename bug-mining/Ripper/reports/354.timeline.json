bit of history:\r\nThe WIN32 API was created for Windows 95. In Windows 95, the FAT32 file system was limited to 260 characters paths. When they introduced the NTFS file system in NT, even though this file system had no such limitation anymore,  for backwards compatibility reasons, they kept that 260-character limitation in the WIN32 APIs. (Educated guess: Some old version of Word broke due to fixed size buffers overflowing when longer pathnames were encountered?)\r\nStill, to allow long-path-aware programs to use pathname longer than that, they documented that these programs should prefix pathnames with the special string \"\\\\\\\\?\\\\\".\r\n\r\nThis is a real problem: I have many systems at work with deep directory trees, with paths longer than 260 characters. Most publicly available WIN32 ports of Unix tools (like find or ag) break on these systems. (And as an aside, they usually also break on pathnames containing Unicode characters > \\u00FF; And misbehave if there are symbolic links.)\r\n\r\nMy MsvcLibX library redefines open(), fopen(), exec(), etc, and prepends that special \"\\\\\\\\?\\\\\" string to all pathnames it receives, before passing it on the Windows' CreateFile(). It also defines Standard C library directory access routines missing in MS libc.\r\nI use it for all my system management tools, and this ensures they work reliably on all our systems at work. Including the ones with deep directory trees. Including the ones localized in Russian or Chinese. Including the new ones with symbolic links. Including the old XP systems that do NOT support the symbolic link APIs. Etc.\r\n\r\nGive me a few days: I'll try to build ripgrep with MsvcLibX, and I'll report about the difficulties and benefits.\r\n","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/comments/280010360/reactions","total_count":5,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":5,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"JFLarvoire","id":18487015,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NDg3MDE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18487015?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JFLarvoire","html_url":"https://github.com/JFLarvoire","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JFLarvoire/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JFLarvoire/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JFLarvoire/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JFLarvoire/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JFLarvoire/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JFLarvoire/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JFLarvoire/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JFLarvoire/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JFLarvoire/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/comments/280012296","html_url":"https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/364#issuecomment-280012296","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/364","id":280012296,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI4MDAxMjI5Ng==","user":{"login":"BurntSushi","id":456674,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NjY3NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/456674?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi","html_url":"https://github.com/BurntSushi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-02-15T13:37:23Z","updated_at":"2017-02-15T13:37:50Z","body":"@JFLarvoire Thanks for the explanation!

investigating a report that listing files (`--files`) on Windows when following symlinks (`--follow`) takes much more time than without symlinks.\r\n\r\nIt appears that in some cases `cnpm` (an `npm` replacement) uses symlinks to organize the `node_modules` folder and that then slows down ripgrep. (https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/35659#issuecomment-335535129 has an example `package.json` that when installed using `cnpm i` reproduces the problem.)\r\n\r\nLooking at the trace in Process Monitor I see many files being opened for reading metadata in `DirEntryRaw:from_link` and to detect loops in same_file's `Handle::from_path`.\r\n\r\nOne area where this might be improved is where `check_symlink_loop()` loops over parent directories of each symlinked directory, causing is_same_file to open the same parent directory once for each of its symlinked subdirectories. Maybe a directory's id could be cached for the duration of its content being traversed?\r\n\r\n/cc @roblourens","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/633/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/633/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/comments/362246526","html_url":"https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/364#issuecomment-362246526","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/364","id":362246526,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM2MjI0NjUyNg==","user":{"login":"BurntSushi","id":456674,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NjY3NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/456674?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi","html_url":"https://github.com/BurntSushi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-02-01T12:06:20Z","updated_at":"2018-02-01T12:06:20Z","body":"@chrmarti @roblourens Do either of you know how to enable long path name support on a per-application basis?
