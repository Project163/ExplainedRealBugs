agreed. My feeling is that this should get lumped into #196 (where I also left a [comment explaining some things just now](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/196#issuecomment-314943495)), although I can appreciate that these are really two orthogonal issues. It just so happens that persistent config is blocked on it. But we can make your situation better without needing to finish persistent config, and this issue is thorny enough that I think giving it its own ticket is a good idea.\r\n\r\nAs a possible work-around until this is fixed properly, if you prefix your command with `\\` (e.g., `\\rg -S pattern`), then your shell should ignore any aliases you have set up and invoke the command directly.\r\n\r\n> This is undesirable behavior both when writing scripts and when trying to use aliases as defaults. Both scripts and aliases face the same problem: building up a complex command line by nesting contexts. This rule means that this process needs to be globally aware of all the outer contexts.\r\n\r\nI think you might find that you have this problem regardless, although I can agree that the particular version of the problem you have might be the most annoying version of it. In particular, if you write a script that assumes your default config, then it might fail when the default config isn't present (on a different machine) or if it changes over times as your preferences evolve. My \"answer\" to that is to avoid using custom defaults inside scripts.","author_association":"OWNER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/comments/314944294/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"BurntSushi","id":456674,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NjY3NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/456674?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi","html_url":"https://github.com/BurntSushi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":1161769799,"node_id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDExNjE3Njk3OTk=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/events/1161769799","actor":{"login":"BurntSushi","id":456674,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NjY3NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/456674?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi","html_url":"https://github.com/BurntSushi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2017-07-13T01:34:20Z","label":{"name":"enhancement","color":"84b6eb"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":1161769801,"node_id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDExNjE3Njk4MDE=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/events/1161769801","actor":{"login":"BurntSushi","id":456674,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NjY3NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/456674?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi","html_url":"https://github.com/BurntSushi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2017-07-13T01:34:20Z","label":{"name":"question","color":"cc317c"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/comments/314944864","html_url":"https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/553#issuecomment-314944864","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/553","id":314944864,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMxNDk0NDg2NA==","user":{"login":"sarahgerweck","id":3421345,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MjEzNDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3421345?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarahgerweck","html_url":"https://github.com/sarahgerweck","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarahgerweck/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarahgerweck/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarahgerweck/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarahgerweck/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarahgerweck/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarahgerweck/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarahgerweck/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sarahgerweck/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github

I don't think i like the suggested solution (it should be the default behaviour, you shouldn't have to write a bunch of code for every single option) but that's where the immediate fix would come from i think.\r\n\r\ntbh, these sorts of problems are common to almost every library that tries to provide a more 'modern' approach to argument-handling than `getopt(3)`/`getopt_long(3)`. Python's `argparse` (and `optparse` before it), Swift's Commander, PHP's Symfony Console and Zend Console, &c. — they all have really frustrating limitations when it comes to dealing with options that appear multiple times or whose position in the argument list is supposed to be meaningful.\r\n\r\n`clap` is actually really functionally advanced compared to all of those, but you still run up against some fundamental issues that would be very simple to deal with if the library would just give you back the list of arguments so you could handle them yourself with a `for` loop.\r\n\r\nGiven all of what `clap` already does, though, this *particular* issue doesn't seem like it'd be too difficult to solve. Probably just a matter of time and priorities.","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/comments/314951362/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"okdana","id":122095,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMjA5NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/122095?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/okdana","html_url":"https://github.com/okdana","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/okdana/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/okdana/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/okdana/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/okdana/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/okdana/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/okdana/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/okdana/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/okdana/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/okdana/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"actor":{"login":"lilyball","id":714,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcxNA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/714?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lilyball","html_url":"https://github.com/lilyball","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lilyball/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lilyball/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lilyball/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lilyball/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lilyball/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lilyball/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lilyball/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lilyball/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lilyball/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-08-04T19:19:33Z","updated_at":"2017-08-04T19:19:33Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/clap-rs/clap/issues/976","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/clap-rs/clap","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/clap-rs/clap/issues/976/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/clap-rs/clap/issues/976/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/clap-rs/clap/issues/976/events","html_url":"https://github.com/clap-rs/clap/issues/976","id":232109882,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWUyMzIxMDk4ODI=","number":976,"title":"Support

PR fixes both #196 and #553. The commit messages have most of the details (including some goodies like a 2x decrease in release build time), but the TL;DR is that ripgrep now recognizes a `RIPGREP_CONFIG_PATH` environment variable. When set and non-empty, ripgrep will read shell arguments from it (one per line) and prepend them to whatever explicit CLI arguments have been given. A new flag, `--no-config`, prevents any sort of configuration from being loaded from a file.\r\n\r\nThis does not add any support for auto-loading config files from pre-determined locations like one's `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME` directory.
