When I'm searching through my source files, I often not only want to find all occurrences, but when multiple hits are involved, I also want to find the most recent modification (by mtime). It would be nice to be able to sort output files (*with context*), sorted by time and reverse time.\r\n\r\nAfaik, none of the various searching tools allow to do this. Not easily at least.\r\n\r\nTo do it currently, I actually do two passes:\r\n\r\n- find file candidates fist\r\n- sort files by mtime\r\n- search within files\r\n\r\nThis is necessary as I obviously like to see the match context as well (otherwise I could stop at step 2). But having to find candidates first introduces extra overhead that cannot be avoided.\r\n\r\nThis requires buffering matches before showing the output, of course, but the search can be ran in parallel still.","closed_by":{"login":"BurntSushi","id":456674,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NjY3NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/456674?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi","html_url":"https://github.com/BurntSushi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/404/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/404/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
