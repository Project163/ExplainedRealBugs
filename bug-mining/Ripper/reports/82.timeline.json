So for example, if you did this: `--type-add 'foo:*.foo' --type-include 'bar:foo' --type-add 'foo:*.wat'`, then it's not exactly clear what `bar` should contain. We can either process all includes after all additions, or all includes before any additions. Neither are necessarily intuitive.\n\nWe have the same problem with --type-clear, but I'm hesitant to make it worse until we either decide to live with it, or fix it. So I'm going to let this one linger for now.\n\nThe other potential relief is that I expect `rg` to gain support for an RC file or similar.\n","author_association":"OWNER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/comments/249438306/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"BurntSushi","id":456674,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NjY3NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/456674?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi","html_url":"https://github.com/BurntSushi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":801578022,"node_id":"MDE3OlJlbmFtZWRUaXRsZUV2ZW50ODAxNTc4MDIy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/events/801578022","actor":{"login":"BurntSushi","id":456674,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NjY3NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/456674?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi","html_url":"https://github.com/BurntSushi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"renamed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2016-09-25T19:03:55Z","rename":{"from":"It

I'd like to propose a specification for this so we can move forward. Here are a couple key design constraints that I've imposed:\n1. Do not add any additional flags for the reasons pointed out above. Therefore, this feature has to be made available in an existing flag like `--type-add` (which is really the only sensible choice).\n2. Do not break any existing uses.\n\nOK, now for the spec. The documentation for `--type-add` should be modified to include:\n\n`--type-add` can also be used to include rules from other types with the special `include` directive. The `include` directive permits specifying one or more other type names (separated by a comma) that have been defined and its rules will automatically be imported into the type specified. For example, to create a type called `src` that matches C++, Python and Markdown files, one can use:\n\n```\n--type-add 'src:include:cpp,py,md'\n```\n\nAdditional glob rules can still be added to the `src` type by using the `--type-add` flag again:\n\n```\n--type-add 'src:include:cpp,py,md' --type-add 'src:*.foo'\n```\n\nNote that type names must consist only of Unicode letters. Punctuation characters are not allowed.\n\n---\n\nIf someone has thoughts on the above or would like to implement it, I'd be happy to mentor it. I think it is a relatively isolated change and should probably only require modifying the implementation of [`TypesBuilder::add_def`](https://docs.rs/ignore/0.1.5/ignore/types/struct.TypesBuilder.html#method.add_def) in the [`ignore` crate](https://docs.rs/ignore).\n","author_association":"OWNER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/comments/261718292/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"BurntSushi","id":456674,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NjY3NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/456674?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi","html_url":"https://github.com/BurntSushi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":865358695,"node_id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDg2NTM1ODY5NQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/events/865358695","actor":{"login":"BurntSushi","id":456674,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NjY3NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/456674?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi","html_url":"https://github.com/BurntSushi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2016-11-19T14:53:12Z","label":{"name":"help
