In particular, when multiline mode is enabled,\r\n           ripgrep requires that each file it searches is laid out contiguously in\r\n           memory (either by reading it onto the heap or  by  memory-mapping  it).\r\n           Things  that  cannot  be memory-mapped (such as stdin) will be consumed\r\n           until EOF before searching can begin. In general, ripgrep will only  do\r\n           these  things when necessary.  Specifically, if the -U/--multiline flag\r\n           is provided but the regex does not contain patterns that would match \\n\r\n           characters, then ripgrep will automatically  avoid  reading  each  file\r\n           into  memory before searching it.  Nevertheless, if you only care about\r\n           matches spanning at most one line, then it is always better to  disable\r\n           multiline mode.\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd sure enough:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ cat file.txt \r\nstart end\r\nstart end\r\n\r\n$ rg --count-matches \"start|end\" file.txt \r\n4\r\n\r\n$ rg --count \"start|end\" file.txt \r\n2\r\n\r\n$ rg --count --multiline \"start|end\" file.txt \r\n2\r\n\r\n$ rg --count --multiline \"^start|end$\" file.txt \r\n4\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn words: when the regex doesn't contain `^` or `$`, ripgrep notices that multiline mode is useless and runs the normal, non-multiline mode, but then this changes the semantics of `--count`.","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/comments/2227503952/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"jeanas","id":37271310,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3MjcxMzEw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/37271310?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeanas","html_url":"https://github.com/jeanas","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeanas/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeanas/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeanas/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeanas/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeanas/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeanas/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeanas/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeanas/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeanas/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/comments/2302858095","html_url":"https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/2852#issuecomment-2302858095","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/2852","id":2302858095,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAzJbyc6JQtNv","user":{"login":"meedstrom","id":68893079,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4ODkzMDc5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/68893079?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/meedstrom","html_url":"https://github.com/meedstrom","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/meedstrom/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/meedstrom/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/meedstrom/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/meedstrom/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/meedstrom/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/meedstrom/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/meedstrom/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/meedstrom/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/meedstrom/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-08-21T19:26:23Z","updated_at":"2024-08-21T19:26:23Z","body":"Could
