again for the bug report! It turns out that musl's allocator was slowing ripgrep down quite a bit. i.e., Building ripgrep 0.10.0 with a newer version of Rust with musl exhibits the same performance regression, and profiling shows a lot of time being spent in musl's allocator. This popped up as a regression in ripgrep 11 because Rust recently stopped bundling jemalloc by default, and is instead now using the system allocator by default.\r\n\r\nI've pushed a fix which goes back to using jemalloc when building ripgrep with musl. I'll consider putting out a patch release at some point soon, since this is a pretty bad performance regression.\r\n\r\nThanks so much for noticing and for providing a reproducible bug report!","author_association":"OWNER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/comments/486432534/reactions","total_count":5,"+1":5,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"BurntSushi","id":456674,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NjY3NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/456674?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi","html_url":"https://github.com/BurntSushi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/comments/486434295","html_url":"https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/1268#issuecomment-486434295","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/1268","id":486434295,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ4NjQzNDI5NQ==","user":{"login":"ulchie","id":328091,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyODA5MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/328091?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ulchie","html_url":"https://github.com/ulchie","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ulchie/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ulchie/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ulchie/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ulchie/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ulchie/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ulchie/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ulchie/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ulchie/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ulchie/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-04-24T21:29:37Z","updated_at":"2019-04-24T21:29:48Z","body":"No problem!

thought I was linking statically against musl when building the [precompiled binary](https://github.com/rmcolq/pandora/tree/master/scripts/portable_binary_builder). Brice and me found out I was actually not. I was statically linking glibc, and [this is not good for several reasons](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57476533/why-is-statically-linking-glibc-discouraged). \r\n\r\nIn [this commit](https://github.com/leoisl/pandora/commit/f24df667e599ae14ae46ed689c6520b60cda1785), where the main change is changing the base image of the container to alpine, we necessarily link against musl, but some dependencies are not straightforward to get working in alpine. In this case, the `backward` lib was a bit complicated to get compiled in alpine, and this just provides meaningful stacktraces in case of errors, which can help a little bit debugging. Usually debugging is a bit more involved, having to debug the execution step-by-step in an IDE with a MWE. What I mean is by producing a binary that is totally portable, linked statically against musl, we will lose the ability to produce meaning stacktraces in case of errors, but I don't think such stacktraces are very useful anyway. It is a cost that is ok to pay for me. I am just checking with you if it is also. If yes, I will create a PR and release a minor version with this small fix.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/iqbal-lab-org/pandora/issues/289/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/iqbal-lab-org/pandora/issues/289/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"actor":{"login":"tavianator","id":1692591,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2OTI1OTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1692591?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tavianator","html_url":"https://github.com/tavianator","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tavianator/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tavianator/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tavianator/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tavianator/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tavianator/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tavianator/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tavianator/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tavianator/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tavianator/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-03-08T15:51:32Z","updated_at":"2022-03-08T15:51:32Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sharkdp/fd/issues/980","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sharkdp/fd","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sharkdp/fd/issues/980/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sharkdp/fd/issues/980/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sharkdp/fd/issues/980/events","html_url":"https://github.com/sharkdp/fd/issues/980","id":1162212193,"node_id":"I_kwDOBWllys5FRfNh","number":980,"title":"3x~10x
