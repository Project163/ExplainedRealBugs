That isn't actually enough to reproduce the full issue, because it doesn't demonstrate that `**.txt` is actually recognized by `git`:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ git init\r\nInitialized empty Git repository in /tmp/ripgrep-373/.git/\r\n$ touch hi.txt\r\n$ git status\r\nOn branch master\r\n\r\nInitial commit\r\n\r\nUntracked files:\r\n  (use \"git add <file>...\" to include in what will be committed)\r\n\r\n        hi.txt\r\n\r\nnothing added to commit but untracked files present (use \"git add\" to track)\r\n$ echo '**.txt' > .gitignore\r\n$ git status\r\nOn branch master\r\n\r\nInitial commit\r\n\r\nUntracked files:\r\n  (use \"git add <file>...\" to include in what will be committed)\r\n\r\n        .gitignore\r\n\r\nnothing added to commit but untracked files present (use \"git add\" to track)\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut according to the specification that I actually implemented (see `man gitignore`), the `**.txt` construction is actually invalid:\r\n\r\n```\r\nTwo consecutive asterisks (\"**\") in patterns matched against full pathname may\r\nhave special meaning:\r\n\r\n  * A leading \"**\" followed by a slash means match in all directories. For\r\n    example, \"**/foo\" matches file or directory \"foo\" anywhere, the same as\r\n    pattern \"foo\". \"**/foo/bar\" matches file or directory \"bar\" anywhere that\r\n    is directly under directory \"foo\".\r\n\r\n  * A trailing \"/**\" matches everything inside. For example, \"abc/**\" matches\r\n    all files inside directory \"abc\", relative to the location of the\r\n    .gitignore file, with infinite depth.\r\n\r\n  * A slash followed by two consecutive asterisks then a slash matches zero or\r\n    more directories. For example, \"a/**/b\" matches \"a/b\", \"a/x/b\", \"a/x/y/b\"\r\n    and so on.\r\n\r\n  * Other consecutive asterisks are considered invalid.\r\n```\r\n\r\nI'm not sure what to do here. Either `git` has a bug in their specification or their implementation is non-conforming. If it's the former, then ripgrep should probably implement `**.txt`. If it's the latter, then ripgrep should continue to recognize `**.txt` as invalid.","author_association":"OWNER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/comments/290129485/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"BurntSushi","id":456674,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NjY3NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/456674?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi","html_url":"https://github.com/BurntSushi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":1020693308,"node_id":"MDEzOlJlb3BlbmVkRXZlbnQxMDIwNjkzMzA4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/events/1020693308","actor":{"login":"BurntSushi","id":456674,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NjY3NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/456674?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi","html_url":"https://github.com/BurntSushi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"reopened","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2017-03-29T15:46:38Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/comments/290752485","html_url":"https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/373#issuecomment-290752485","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/373","id":290752485,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI5MDc1MjQ4NQ==","user":{"login":"derimagia","id":999489,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk5OTQ4OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/999489?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/derimagia","html_url":"https://github.com/derimagia","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/derimagia/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/derimagia/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/derimagia/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/derimagia/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/derimagia/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/derimagia/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/derimagia/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/derimagia/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/derimagia/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-03-31T15:56:01Z","updated_at":"2017-03-31T15:56:01Z","body":"Had the same issue, I always thought git used `fnmatch` for this.
