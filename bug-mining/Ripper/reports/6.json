If I change the pattern to `**/target/` then `rg` works as expected, but `ag` stops ignoring all `target` directories. In both cases `git` ignores both the top level directory and the subdirectories.\n\nHere's a shell session to illustrate the issue:\n\n```\n/p/tmp> rg --version\n0.1.16\n/p/tmp> git init abc\nInitialized empty Git repository in /private/tmp/abc/.git/\n/p/tmp> cd abc/\n/p/t/abc> mkdir ghi\n/p/t/abc> mkdir -p def/ghi\n/p/t/abc> echo ghi/ > .gitignore\n/p/t/abc> echo xyz > ghi/toplevel.txt\n/p/t/abc> echo xyz > def/ghi/subdir.txt\n/p/t/abc> ag xyz\n/p/t/abc> rg xyz\ndef/ghi/subdir.txt\n1:xyz\n/p/t/abc> git status\nOn branch master\n\nInitial commit\n\nUntracked files:\n  (use \"git add <file>...\" to include in what will be committed)\n\n        .gitignore\n\nnothing added to commit but untracked files present (use \"git add\" to track)\n/p/t/abc> echo '**/ghi/' > .gitignore\n/p/t/abc> ag xyz\ndef/ghi/subdir.txt\n1:xyz\n\nghi/toplevel.txt\n1:xyz\n/p/t/abc> rg xyz\nNo files were searched, which means ripgrep probably applied a filter you didn't expect.
