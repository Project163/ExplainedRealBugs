This deb package is generated using the helpful [`cargo-deb`](https://github.com/mmstick/cargo-deb) tool. This tool basically \"just works\": I run it in the root of the ripgrep repo and out pops a deb package that can be installed in any Debian or Ubuntu system. This approach isn't idiomatic in the sense that every dependency of ripgrep is individually packaged, but the idiomatic approach is **extremely costly**. So costly, in fact, that I could never personally do it. But I can run `cargo deb`.\r\n\r\nThere is a small problem: the deb package doesn't contain a man page. I suspect the right answer here is to somehow teach `cargo deb` how to bundle a man page with the package it produces.","closed_by":{"login":"BurntSushi","id":456674,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NjY3NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/456674?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi","html_url":"https://github.com/BurntSushi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/842/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/842/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
