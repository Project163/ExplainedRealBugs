In the long ago, ripgrep (formerly called `rep`) was my playground for testing the regex library. I initially tried to move all search code into a separate `grep` crate, but couldn't quite figure out how to do it. So I ended up splitting a good chunk of it back out into ripgrep proper, and probably just forgot to get rid of the `memmap` dependency.\r\n\r\nI am planning on moving the search code back into the `grep` crate, at which point, the `memmap` dependency may return. (What I know now that I was missing before is that the search code needs to be abstract over a sink/printer interface.)","author_association":"OWNER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/comments/269380775/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":1,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"BurntSushi","id":456674,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NjY3NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/456674?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi","html_url":"https://github.com/BurntSushi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":906003551,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50OTA2MDAzNTUx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/events/906003551","actor":{"login":"Dr-Emann","id":1153779,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTM3Nzk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1153779?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Dr-Emann","html_url":"https://github.com/Dr-Emann","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Dr-Emann/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Dr-Emann/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Dr-Emann/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Dr-Emann/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Dr-Emann/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Dr-Emann/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Dr-Emann/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Dr-Emann/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Dr-Emann/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2016-12-27T20:49:16Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":906003552,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDkwNjAwMzU1Mg==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/events/906003552","actor":{"login":"Dr-Emann","id":1153779,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTM3Nzk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1153779?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Dr-Emann","html_url":"https://github.com/Dr-Emann","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Dr-Emann/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Dr-Emann/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Dr-Emann/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Dr-Emann/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Dr-Emann/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Dr-Emann/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Dr-Emann/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Dr-Emann/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Dr-Emann/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2016-12-27T20:49:16Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
