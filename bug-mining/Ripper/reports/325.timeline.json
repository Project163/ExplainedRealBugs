up on #1842, it could be great and very useful if, in addition to the current flags introduced in #1871:\r\n\r\n    --field-match-separator\r\n    --field-context-separator\r\n\r\nthere were, in addition, also:\r\n\r\n    --field-match-separator-postfix\r\n    --field-match-separator-prefix\r\n    --field-context-separator-prefix\r\n    --field-context-separator-postfix\r\n\r\nThis would help when invoking ripgrep in an IDE, such as Visual Studio Code (VSC), to allow clicking on links detected in terminals. This is because with the defaulf of `rg` default, e.g.:\r\n\r\n    .bazelrc:4:common --enable_bzlmod\r\n\r\nlink detection does not work. Using `--field-match-separator=\": \"` or `--field-match-separator=\" :\"` isn't right and doesn't work either.\r\n\r\nWhat one would ideally want is (something like): `--field-match-separator-prefix=\":\" --field-match-separator-postfix=\" \"` so that it would print:\r\n\r\n    .bazelrc:4 common --enable_bzlmod\r\n\r\nPS: I guess one could work around this either by post-processing `rg` output, or perhaps with [a custom problem matcher in VSC](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/tasks#_defining-a-problem-matcher), but the flags would be neat.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/2464/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/2464/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"not_planned"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":11794052166,"node_id":"REFE_lADOAzJbyc4ypM4YzwAAAAK--vRG","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/events/11794052166","actor":{"login":"vors","id":816680,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxNjY4MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/816680?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vors","html_url":"https://github.com/vors","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vors/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vors/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vors/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vors/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vors/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vors/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vors/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vors/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vors/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"578e1992fa21d3612d3e613d8869dbbb16e33cbe","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vors/ripgrep/commits/578e1992fa21d3612d3e613d8869dbbb16e33cbe","created_at":"2024-02-13T21:15:49Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
