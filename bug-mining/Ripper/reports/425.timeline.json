some more thoughts.\n\nSeems like `--max-count`, which is later referred as `max_matches` in the code is only used in the sink. But if we merge matches together sink can't control how many matches will be passed to it and can only react to the sinked matches. So if we go over the limit, there is nothing that sink can do here.\n\nOne way to tackle this issue would be to expose `max_matches` to the `MultiLine` Searcher object, count matches there as well and stop early when we reached `max_matches` even though there might be some more matches on the next line.\n\nThis approach should work, but I'm not sure if it is a good idea from the design point of view. \n\nExample fix:

https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/3076\r\n\r\nWhen we have matches on adjacent lines using multiline searcher we group them together before passing them to the sink. This behaviour allows replacement logic to work correctly, when we try to replace \"\\n\" with something else (see https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/1311 for more details).\r\n\r\nHowever, this also means that the `--max-count` option is not respected when grouping matches together, because max count is only enforced in a sink. And if we have multiple matches on adjacent lines they will be passed to the sink together, potentially going over the limit.\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes that by also calculating the number of matches in the searcher itself and breaking early in case max count is reached during the search. This way we make sure we don't overcount the matches.\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ cat file\r\nline 2\r\nline 3 x\r\nline 2\r\nline 3\r\n$ target/debug/rg --max-count=1 -U \"line 2\\nline 3\" file --stats

The\r\ncommit message has the details for why we're doing this, but the short\r\nstory is to fix #3076 without other regressions.\r\n\r\nNote that this is a breaking change for `grep-printer`, so this will\r\nrequire a semver incompatible release.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/3166/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/3166/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":20096394238,"node_id":"REFE_lADOAzJbyc69GC-RzwAAAASt1qP-","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/events/20096394238","actor":{"login":"BurntSushi","id":456674,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NjY3NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/456674?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi","html_url":"https://github.com/BurntSushi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"9d8016d10c94a5af2768eb6dd0440386a7d317a0","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/commits/9d8016d10c94a5af2768eb6dd0440386a7d317a0","created_at":"2025-10-04T13:19:54Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"actor":{"login":"moonfruit","id":1070090,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNzAwOTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1070090?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/moonfruit","html_url":"https://github.com/moonfruit","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moonfruit/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moonfruit/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moonfruit/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moonfruit/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moonfruit/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moonfruit/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moonfruit/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moonfruit/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/moonfruit/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-10-16T06:51:09Z","updated_at":"2025-10-16T06:51:09Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Homebrew/homebrew-core/issues/249827","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Homebrew/homebrew-core","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Homebrew/homebrew-core/issues/249827/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Homebrew/homebrew-core/issues/249827/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Homebrew/homebrew-core/issues/249827/events","html_url":"https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core/pull/249827","id":3520560062,"node_id":"PR_kwDOAyaC3M6uBGdF","number":249827,"title":"ripgrep

release of ripgrep that mostly has bug fixes,\r\nsome minor performance improvements and minor new features.\r\n\r\n> In case you haven't heard of it before, ripgrep is a line-oriented search\r\n> tool that recursively searches the current directory for a regex pattern.\r\n> By default, ripgrep will respect gitignore rules and automatically skip\r\n> hidden files/directories and binary files.\r\n\r\nHere are some highlights:\r\n\r\n* Several bugs around gitignore matching have been fixed. This includes\r\n  a commonly reported bug related to applying gitignore rules from parent\r\n  directories.\r\n* A memory usage regression when handling very large gitignore files has been\r\n  fixed.\r\n* `rg -vf file`, where `file` is empty, now matches everything.\r\n* The `-r/--replace` flag now works with `--json`.\r\n* A subset of Jujutsu (`jj`) repositories are now treated as if they were git\r\n  repositories. That is, ripgrep will respect `jj`'s gitignores.\r\n* Globs can now use nested curly braces.\r\n\r\nPlatform support:\r\n\r\n* `aarch64` for Windows now has release artifacts.\r\n* `powerpc64` no longer has release artifacts generated for it. The CI\r\n  release workflow stopped working, and I didn't deem it worth my time to\r\n  debug it. If someone wants this and can test it, I'd be happy to add it\r\n  back.\r\n* ripgrep binaries are now compiled with full LTO enabled. You may notice\r\n  small performance improvements from this and a modest decrease in binary\r\n  size.\r\n\r\nPerformance improvements:\r\n\r\n* [PERF #2111](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/2111):\r\n  Don't resolve helper binaries on Windows when `-z/--search-zip` isn't used.\r\n* [PERF #2865](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/pull/2865):\r\n  Avoid using path canonicalization on Windows when emitting hyperlinks.\r\n* [PERF #3184](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/pull/3184):\r\n  Improve performance of large values with `-A/--after-context`.\r\n\r\nBug fixes:\r\n\r\n* [BUG
