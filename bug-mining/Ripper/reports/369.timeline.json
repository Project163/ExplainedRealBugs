ripgrep respects `$HOME/.gitconfig` and `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/git/config`, but not `.git/config` (the \"local\" or \"project\" config). Git makes it such that `.git/config` overrides the other two options, while still respecting the `./.gitignore`. This commit brings this functionality to ripgrep (while also cleaning a few repetitive segments of code).\r\n\r\nTo demonstrate with a reproducible example (of course, be careful with overriding any files):\r\n```sh\r\n$ mkdir test && cd test\r\n$ touch file file.customexclude file.globalignore file.pwdignore\r\n$ echo '*.pwdignore' > .gitignore\r\n$ mkdir -p /tmp/tempdir && echo

ignored](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8801729/is-it-possible-to-have-different-git-configuration-for-different-projects) when a `.git/config` exists (as demonstrated by the output of

backup\r\n# backup.sql\r\n# global_gitignore\r\n# included_gitconfig\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### What is the expected behavior?\r\n`backup.sql` shouldn't have been listed, it is ignored by the global ignore file `./global_gitignore` that is set as `core.excludesfile` in `./included_gitconfig`, which in turn is included into `~/.gitconfig` using the `include.path` mechanism.\r\n\r\nTo me it looks like

like to take a look into fixing this since it looks like a pretty straight forward task. From what I was able to gather, this seems to be a problem when .gitconfig files have double quotes surrounding the value for `excludesFile`. If this is a small change to the regex under [ripgrep/crates/ignore/src/gitignore.rs](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/blob/bc5504932764d8d4735bf955f6f7e04a95f151b8/crates/ignore/src/gitignore.rs#L600), then we probably might be able to get away with adding the double quote character to a character set along with whitespaces. So the new regex would look

Issue: #2392 \r\n\r\n# Summary of problem:\r\nIn a .gitconfig file, a user may specify additional file patterns they may want to ignore when committing changes by using the `core.excludesFile` setting. RipGrep respects these file patterns as well. \r\n\r\nGit also handles file paths that are surrounded by double quotes like\r\n```\r\n[core]\r\n    excludesFile = \"~/foo/bar\"\r\n```\r\nRipGrep's logic does not handle for double quotes. \r\n\r\n# Changes\r\nThe regex used to parse the `excludesFile` section of the .gitconfig adds double quotes (\\x22)  as a part of the parsing pattern.\r\n\r\n# Tests\r\nWrote `parse_excludes_file4`  for unit testing\r\n\r\nManually tested from issue's example:\r\n```\r\n$ mkdir rg_global_gitignore\r\n$ cd rg_global_gitignore\r\n$ git init\r\n\r\n# adding the config this way will strip the quotation marks\r\n# git config --global core.excludesFile \"~/.gitignore\"\r\n\r\n# open ~/.gitconfig and add:\r\n#\r\n# [core]\r\n# \texcludesFile = \"~/.gitignore\"\r\n\r\n$ echo \"*.sql\" > ~/.gitignore\r\n\r\n$ touch backup backup.sql backup123.sql db_backup.sql\r\n$ <path>/ripgrep/target/release/rg --files

by `brew bump`\n\n---\n\nCreated with `brew bump-formula-pr`.<details>\n  <summary>release notes</summary>\n  <pre>ripgrep 14 is a new major version release of ripgrep that has some new\r\nfeatures, performance improvements and a lot of bug fixes.\r\n\r\n> In case you haven't heard of it before, ripgrep is a line-oriented search\r\n> tool that recursively searches the current directory for a regex pattern.\r\n> By default, ripgrep will respect gitignore rules and automatically skip\r\n> hidden files/directories and binary files.\r\n\r\nThe headling feature in this release is hyperlink support. In this release,\r\nthey are an opt-in feature but may change to an opt-out feature in the future.\r\nTo enable them, try passing `--hyperlink-format default`. If you use [VS Code],\r\nthen try passing `--hyperlink-format vscode`. Please [report your experience\r\nwith hyperlinks][report-hyperlinks], positive or negative.\r\n\r\n[VS Code]: https://code.visualstudio.com/\r\n[report-hyperlinks]: https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/discussions/2611\r\n\r\nAnother headling development in this release is that it contains a rewrite of\r\nits regex engine. You generally shouldn't notice any changes, except for some\r\nsearches may get faster. You can read more about the [regex engine rewrite on\r\nmy blog][regex-internals]. Please [report your performance improvements or\r\nregressions that you notice][report-perf].\r\n\r\n[report-perf]: https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/discussions/2652\r\n\r\nFinally, ripgrep switched the library it uses for argument parsing. Users\r\nshould not notice a difference in most cases (error messages have changed\r\nsomewhat), but flag overrides should generally be more consistent. For example,\r\nthings like `--no-ignore --ignore-vcs` work as one would expect (disables all\r\nfiltering related to ignore rules except for rules found in version control\r\nsystems such as `git`).\r\n\r\n[regex-internals]: https://blog.burntsushi.net/regex-internals/\r\n\r\n**BREAKING CHANGES**:\r\n\r\n* `rg -C1 -A2` used to be equivalent to `rg -A2`, but now it is equivalent to\r\n  `rg -B1 -A2`. That is, `-A` and `-B` no longer completely override `-C`.\r\n  Instead, they only partially override `-C`.\r\n\r\nBuild process changes:\r\n\r\n* ripgrep's shell completions and man page are now created by running ripgrep\r\nwith a new `--generate` flag. For example, `rg --generate man` will write a\r\nman page in `roff` format on stdout. The release archives have not changed.\r\n* The optional build dependency on `asciidoc` or `asciidoctor` has been\r\ndropped. Previously, it was used to produce ripgrep's man page. ripgrep now\r\nowns this process itself by writing `roff` directly.\r\n\r\nPerformance improvements:\r\n\r\n* [PERF #1746](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/1746):\r\n  Make some cases with inner literals faster.\r\n* [PERF #1760](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/1760):\r\n  Make most searches with `\\b` look-arounds (among others) much faster.\r\n* [PERF #2591](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/pull/2591):\r\n  Parallel directory traversal now uses work stealing for faster searches.\r\n* [PERF #2642](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/pull/2642):\r\n  Parallel directory traversal has some contention reduced.\r\n\r\nFeature enhancements:\r\n\r\n* Added or improved file type filtering for Ada, DITA, Elixir, Fuchsia, Gentoo,\r\n  Gradle, GraphQL, Markdown, Prolog, Raku, TypeScript, USD, V\r\n* [FEATURE #665](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/665):\r\n  Add a new `--hyperlink-format` flag that turns file paths into hyperlinks.\r\n* [FEATURE #1709](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/1709):\r\n  Improve documentation of ripgrep's behavior when stdout is a tty.\r\n* [FEATURE #1737](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/1737):\r\n  Provide binaries for Apple silicon.\r\n* [FEATURE

detection enabled.\r\n* [FEATURE #2195](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/2195):\r\n  When `extra-verbose` mode is enabled in zsh, show extra file type info.\r\n* [FEATURE

#2409](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/pull/2409):\r\n  Added installation instructions for `winget`.\r\n* [FEATURE #2425](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/pull/2425):\r\n  Shell completions (and man page) can be created via `rg --generate`.\r\n* [FEATURE #2524](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/2524):\r\n  The `--debug` flag now indicates whether stdin or `./` is being searched.\r\n* [FEATURE #2643](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/2643):\r\n  Make `-d` a short flag for `--max-depth`.\r\n* [FEATURE
