would be cool to support `grep`'s `-f/--file` option, and it should be relatively easy for us to do so. The implementation strategy I have in mind is to just join all of the patterns/literals using a `|` and hand it off to the regex engine.\n\nIt _might_ be faster to hand build an Aho-Corasick automaton (using the `aho-corasick` crate) if you know we have a bunch of literals. In fact, this is almost assuredly more memory efficient if the number of literals being searched is very large. Unfortunately, this is a harder thing to add, since it would require plumbing an Aho-Corasick automaton through all of the searching code so that either a `Regex` or an `AcAutomaton` could be used.
