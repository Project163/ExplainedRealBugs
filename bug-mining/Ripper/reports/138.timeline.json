was testing it with React app to test](https://github.com/steadylearner/Rust-Full-Stack/tree/master/React_Rust#warp).\r\n\r\nI want to compare it with other frameworks to find how Warp will behave with concurrent requests.\r\n\r\n```console\r\nINFO Requests: 1086, requests per second: 216, mean latency: 133.9 ms\r\nINFO Requests: 2548, requests per second: 295, mean latency: 582.9 ms\r\nINFO Requests: 4011, requests per second: 293, mean latency: 1354.5 ms\r\nINFO Errors: 115, accumulated errors: 115, 2.9% of total requests\r\nINFO\r\nINFO Target URL:          http://0.0.0.0:8000/\r\nINFO

request)\r\nINFO\r\nINFO   404:   492 errors\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou can see that it shows many errors while other frameworks such as **Express, Actix, Golang** etc aren't and I also think latency and other numbers are comparavely high.\r\n\r\nIs there a reason for them?\r\n\r\nI made [loadtest.bash](https://github.com/steadylearner/Rust-Full-Stack/blob/master/React_Rust/loadtest.bash) and [warp.bash](https://github.com/steadylearner/Rust-Full-Stack/blob/master/React_Rust/warp.bash) to help you test the code locally at [Rust Full Stack](https://github.com/steadylearner/Rust-Full-Stack) repository\r\n\r\nHope this can be solved fast because I want to write a blog post relevant to it to help others how it is easy to use Warp.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/seanmonstar/warp/issues/420/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/seanmonstar/warp/issues/420/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
