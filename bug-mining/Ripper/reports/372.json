It's a bit clunky to enter regularly though. Would you allow the adding of a `-d` shorthand for it? It would also have the advantage that it would match how `fd` as `--max-depth / -d` does it. I don't think you should have to alter your software for someone else's software, but I would suspect there are a group of people who use both who might appreciate it, on top of the group that only use `rg`. It also appears to be used by `du` and a few other tools, which might be why I keep subconsciously reaching for it, though of course there are lots of tools that use `-d` for something else.\r\n\r\nIt seems like this may have been asked before, but I can't see any record of the discussion with a brief search, but worst-case this can be that discussion.\r\n\r\nThe only reason I can see that it might not have been implemented is that there is a [quirky](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/grep.1.html) grep flag with the same name.\r\n```\r\n       -d ACTION, --directories=ACTION\r\n              If an input file is a directory, use ACTION to process it.\r\n              By default, ACTION is read, i.e., read directories just as\r\n              if they were ordinary files.  If ACTION is skip, silently\r\n              skip directories.  If ACTION is recurse, read all files\r\n              under each directory, recursively, following symbolic\r\n              links only if they are on the command line.  This is\r\n              equivalent to the -r option.\r\n```\r\n\r\nI understand that breaking behaviour with `grep` is undesirable, but perhaps this is a sufficiently awkward and underused flag that it might be ok? After all current the behaviour isn't compatible as `-d` does nothing.\r\n\r\nOtherwise there is an argument for paucity of shortcodes for future use, in reply to which I can only make the case that I think this would be useful to lots of people, perhaps more than future yet-to-be-implemented flags? I guess you know much better than me about that.\r\n\r\nA final option would be a config flag to enable it, is there prior art for that?\r\n\r\nHappy to contribute the PR if you agree,\r\n\r\nMax","closed_by":{"login":"BurntSushi","id":456674,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NjY3NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/456674?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi","html_url":"https://github.com/BurntSushi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/2643/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/2643/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
