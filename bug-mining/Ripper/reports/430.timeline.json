Support external subcommands: rg, diff, git-show (etc.)\r\n\r\nThe possible command line now is:\r\n\r\n  delta \\<delta-args> [SUBCMD \\<subcmd-args>]\r\n\r\nIf the entire command line fails to parse because SUBCMD is unknown,\r\nthen try (until the next arg fails) parsing <delta-args> only,\r\nand then parse and call SUBCMD.., output is piped into delta.\r\nOther subcommands also take precedence over the diff/git-diff mode\r\n(`delta a b`, where e.g. a=show and b=HEAD), and any diff call gets\r\nconverted into an external subcommand first.\r\n\r\nAvailable are:\r\n  delta rg ..     => rg --json .. | delta\r\n  delta a b ..    => git diff a b .. | delta\r\n  delta show ..   => git \\<color-on> show .. | delta\r\n\r\nAnd various other git-CMDS: add, blame, checkout, diff, grep, log, reflog and stash.\r\n\r\nThe piping is not done by the shell, but delta, so the subcommands\r\nare now child processes of delta.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n* Set calling process directly because delta started it\r\n\r\nThis info then takes precedence over whatever\r\n`start_determining_calling_process_in_thread()` finds or rather\r\ndoesn't find.\r\n(The simple yet generous SeqCst is used on purpose for the atomic operations.)\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nLooking at the `Call { Delta, .. }` enum from the `--help`  PR, and how the diff sub-command works (both how `-@` is needed to add extra args, and how its ouput is fed back into delta when running as a child process) I had the idea of generalizing that.\r\n\r\nDeltas `rg` integration is great, but `rg --json .. | delta` is a bit clunky, now it is just `delta rg ..`. This also allows using delta without touching any git configs (_\"try before you edit anything\"_), as a proof of concept  `delta show` is implemented here.\r\n\r\nThis is a bit ... creative with the clap command line parser, but it is all quite contained.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dandavison/delta/issues/1769/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":1},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dandavison/delta/issues/1769/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":19854572584,"node_id":"CE_lADOAzJbyc6dy6t3zwAAAASfbLwo","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/events/19854572584","actor":{"login":"BurntSushi","id":456674,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NjY3NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/456674?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi","html_url":"https://github.com/BurntSushi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":"6e77339f30bd4eeaa3980a3256f57e81ec579302","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/commits/6e77339f30bd4eeaa3980a3256f57e81ec579302","created_at":"2025-09-23T01:38:27Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/comments/3322078124","html_url":"https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/2928#issuecomment-3322078124","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/2928","id":3322078124,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAzJbyc7GAuOs","user":{"login":"BurntSushi","id":456674,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NjY3NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/456674?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi","html_url":"https://github.com/BurntSushi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-09-23T01:38:44Z","updated_at":"2025-09-23T01:38:44Z","body":"I
