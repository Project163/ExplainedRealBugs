`rg.exe` is arm64 per Git Bash's `file`, and it appears the test suite succeeded in CI.\r\n\r\nThis PR only adds MSVC support for aarch64, not GNU. Looking at the [available toolchains](https://rust-lang.github.io/rustup-components-history/), it seems the only GNU toolchain for Windows aarch64 is the -gnullvm version, which ripgrep is not using

with `brew bump-formula-pr`.<details>\n  <summary>release notes</summary>\n  <pre>[Sponsorship is appreciated!](https://github.com/sponsors/BurntSushi/)\r\n\r\nripgrep 15 is a new major version release of ripgrep that mostly has bug fixes,\r\nsome minor performance improvements and minor new features.\r\n\r\n> In case you haven't heard of it before, ripgrep is a line-oriented search\r\n> tool that recursively searches the current directory for a regex pattern.\r\n> By default, ripgrep will respect gitignore rules and automatically skip\r\n> hidden files/directories and binary files.\r\n\r\nHere are some highlights:\r\n\r\n* Several bugs around gitignore matching have been fixed. This includes\r\n  a commonly reported bug related to applying gitignore rules from parent\r\n  directories.\r\n* A memory usage regression when handling very large gitignore files has been\r\n  fixed.\r\n* `rg -vf file`, where `file` is empty, now matches everything.\r\n* The `-r/--replace` flag now works with `--json`.\r\n* A subset of Jujutsu (`jj`) repositories are now treated as if they were git\r\n  repositories. That is, ripgrep will respect `jj`'s gitignores.\r\n* Globs can now use nested curly braces.\r\n\r\nPlatform support:\r\n\r\n* `aarch64` for Windows now has release artifacts.\r\n* `powerpc64` no longer has release artifacts generated for it. The CI\r\n  release workflow stopped working, and I didn't deem it worth my time to\r\n  debug it. If someone wants this and can test it, I'd be happy to add it\r\n  back.\r\n* ripgrep binaries are now compiled with full LTO enabled. You may notice\r\n  small performance improvements from this and a modest decrease in binary\r\n  size.\r\n\r\nPerformance improvements:\r\n\r\n* [PERF #2111](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/2111):\r\n  Don't resolve helper binaries on Windows when `-z/--search-zip` isn't used.\r\n* [PERF #2865](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/pull/2865):\r\n  Avoid using path canonicalization on Windows when emitting hyperlinks.\r\n* [PERF #3184](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/pull/3184):\r\n  Improve performance of large values with `-A/--after-context`.\r\n\r\nBug fixes:\r\n\r\n* [BUG #829](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/829),\r\n  [BUG #2731](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/2731),\r\n  [BUG #2747](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/2747),\r\n  [BUG #2770](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/2770),\r\n  [BUG #2778](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/2778),\r\n  [BUG #2836](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/2836),\r\n  [BUG #2933](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/pull/2933),\r\n  [BUG #3067](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/pull/3067):\r\n  Fix bug related to gitignores from parent directories.\r\n* [BUG #1332](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/1332),\r\n  [BUG #3001](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/3001):\r\n  Make `rg -vf file` where `file` is empty match everything.\r\n* [BUG #2177](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/2177):\r\n  Ignore a UTF-8 BOM marker at the start of `.gitignore` (and similar files).\r\n* [BUG #2750](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/2750):\r\n  Fix memory usage regression for some truly large gitignore files.\r\n* [BUG #2944](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/pull/2944):\r\n  Fix a bug where the \"bytes searched\" in `--stats` output could be incorrect.\r\n* [BUG #2990](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/2990):\r\n  Fix a bug where ripgrep would mishandle globs that ended with a `.`.\r\n* [BUG

matches.\r\n* [BUG #3100](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/pull/3100):\r\n  Preserve line terminators when using `-r/--replace` flag.\r\n* [BUG

#3131](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/3131):\r\n  Document inconsistency between `-c/--count` and `--files-with-matches`.\r\n* [BUG
