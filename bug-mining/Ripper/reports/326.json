There's too much context here to split it apart, which GitHub doesn't really make easy to do anyway. So I've re-purposed this issue for the bug described in the title. The main details of the bug are described here: https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/1866#issuecomment-843020533\r\n\r\nBelow is the original issue.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\n#### Describe your feature request\r\n\r\nVim recently added a new feature called \"text properties\" that can be used to highlight text. All it needs to know to highlight is: \r\n\r\n* lnum : line number where match begins\r\n* col : column (counted in bytes) where match begins\r\n* end_lnum : line number where match ends\r\n* end_col : column (counted in bytes) where match ends\r\n\r\nIdeally there would be an option like ``--json-pos`` that  just prints positions of matches for each file, perhaps in json format like following. If that is not possible or two cumbersome, is there a way I can already do this in a performance efficient way using ripgrep?\r\n\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n  {\r\n    \"file\": \"fileA.txt\",\r\n    \"positions\": [\r\n      {\r\n        \"lnum\": 10,\r\n        \"col\": 4,\r\n        \"end_lnum\": 12,\r\n        \"end_col\": 7\r\n      },\r\n      {\r\n        \"lnum\": 15,\r\n        \"col\": 3,\r\n        \"end_lnum\": 15,\r\n        \"end_col\": 5\r\n      },\r\n      {\r\n        \"lnum\": 17,\r\n        \"col\": 12,\r\n        \"end_lnum\": 20,\r\n        \"end_col\": 10\r\n      }\r\n    ]\r\n  },\r\n  {\r\n    \"file\": \"fileB.txt\",\r\n    \"positions\": [\r\n      {\r\n        \"lnum\": 1,\r\n        \"col\": 4,\r\n        \"end_lnum\": 1,\r\n        \"end_col\": 7\r\n      },\r\n      {\r\n        \"lnum\": 30,\r\n        \"col\": 3,\r\n        \"end_lnum\": 31,\r\n        \"end_col\": 5\r\n      }\r\n    ]\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```","closed_by":{"login":"BurntSushi","id":456674,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NjY3NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/456674?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi","html_url":"https://github.com/BurntSushi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/1866/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/1866/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
