See repro steps for details.\n\n### What are the steps to reproduce the behavior?\n\nOn ripgrep 13.0.0 (zsh shell; supports `=()` tmpfile process substitution variant):\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n❯ rg 'hello' <(echo 'why hello there') | cat\r\nwhy hello there\r\n\r\n❯ rg 'hello' =(echo 'why hello there') | cat\r\nwhy hello there\r\n```\r\n\r\nOn ripgrep 14.1.0:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n# this includes the file (actually symlink to a file on my system) in the output\r\n❯ rg 'hello' <(echo 'why hello there') | cat\r\n/proc/self/fd/20:why hello there\r\n\r\n❯ rg 'hello' =(echo 'why hello there') | cat\r\nwhy hello there\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe ripgrep help says:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n❯ rg --help | rg -A6 '\\-I,'\r\n    -I, --no-filename\r\n        This flag instructs ripgrep to never print the file path with each\r\n        matching line. This is the default when ripgrep is explicitly\r\n        instructed to search one file or stdin.\r\n\r\n        This flag overrides -H/--with-filename.\r\n```\n\n### What is the actual behavior?\n\nThe file path is included in the output.\n\n### What is the expected behavior?\n\nExpected the process substitution arg to behave the same as before- it is a single file still, so the `-I` option should be enabled by default.","closed_by":{"login":"BurntSushi","id":456674,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NjY3NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/456674?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi","html_url":"https://github.com/BurntSushi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/2736/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/2736/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
