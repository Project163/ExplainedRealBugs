If you do this: `rg Copyright > output` and then look at the contents of `output`, do you see the results you expect?\r\n\r\nIf so, then I think the problem here is that some of the files you're searching contain invalid UTF-8, and Rust's standard library by default returns an error if you try to write invalid UTF-8 to the console. (The reason why is because UTF-8 needs to be transcoded to UTF-16 to write to the console.) I think the right answer here is to lossily decode the UTF-8 before sending it to `stdout`.\r\n\r\nThis UTF-8 check doesn't happen if you write to a file, which is why redirecting to stdout should produce the expected output.\r\n\r\nThe reason why no error is printed is because ripgrep isn't checking an error when writing to stdout, which is bug
