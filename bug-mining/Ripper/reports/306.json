Because matches from minified files are rarely desired, and currently `rg --type-list` has no type for minified files, I suggest adding a `minified` type so people can ignore minified files while searching by using `--type-not minified`. This new type should be printed as `minified: *.min.js, *.min.css, *.min.html` when we run `rg --type-list`.","closed_by":{"login":"BurntSushi","id":456674,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NjY3NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/456674?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi","html_url":"https://github.com/BurntSushi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/1710/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/1710/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
