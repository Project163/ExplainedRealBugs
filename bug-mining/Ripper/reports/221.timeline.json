The docs are fine in `src/app.rs` (the ultimate source of truth), and they even appear to be fine in the auto-generated ASCIIDoc format:\r\n\r\n```\r\nWhen multiline mode is enabled, ripgrep will lift the restriction that a match\r\ncannot include a line terminator. For example, when multiline mode is not\r\nenabled (the default), then the regex '\\p{any}' will match any Unicode\r\ncodepoint other than '\\n'. Similarly, the regex '\\n' is explicitly forbidden,\r\nand if you try to use it, ripgrep will return an error. However, when multiline\r\nmode is enabled, '\\p{any}' will match any Unicode codepoint, including '\\n',\r\nand regexes like '\\n' are permitted.\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut when it gets translated to the man page format, some text gets clipped:\r\n\r\n```\r\nWhen multiline mode is enabled, ripgrep will lift the restriction that a match cannot include a line terminator\\&.

For example, it looks like every line that contains `'\\\\p{any}'` gets cut out.

is used to convert these documentation strings into a man page. However, the AsciiDoc format reserves the `{identifier}` syntax for [attribute references](http://www.methods.co.nz/asciidoc/userguide.html#_document_attributes), and `a2x` interprets the unescaped substring `{any}` as such an attribute reference. The documentation at that link warns:\r\n\r\n> If an attribute is not defined then the line containing the attribute reference is dropped. This property is used extensively in AsciiDoc configuration files to facilitate conditional markup generation.\r\n\r\nIndeed, the generated `man` page is missing two lines (here, \"lines\" means lines of source code), which you can see in a release build like [this one](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/releases/download/0.10.0/ripgrep-0.10.0-x86_64-apple-darwin.tar.gz), in the `doc/rg.1` file, resulting in this ill-formed paragraph:\r\n\r\n> When multiline mode is enabled, ripgrep will lift the restriction that a match cannot include a line terminator. For example, when multiline mode is not codepoint other than \\n. Similarly, the regex \\n is explicitly forbidden, and if you try to use it, ripgrep will return an error. However, when multiline and regexes like \\n are permitted.\r\n\r\nThe [FAQ says](http://methods.co.nz/asciidoc/faq.html#_how_can_i_escape_asciidoc_markup) the fix is to simply escape the unintentional markup with a backslash, which is what this PR does. I don't have the ripgrep build set up on my machine, so I have not verified this change. I would ask that a maintainer do so before merging.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/1206/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/1206/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":13413906537,"node_id":"REFE_lADOAzJbyc4Wer7GzwAAAAMfh_hp","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/events/13413906537","actor":{"login":"kyagi","id":90729,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkwNzI5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/90729?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kyagi","html_url":"https://github.com/kyagi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kyagi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kyagi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kyagi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kyagi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kyagi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kyagi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kyagi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kyagi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kyagi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"b41e5963279d5a7c633514d4a6afcb480c6c6915","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kyagi/ripgrep/commits/b41e5963279d5a7c633514d4a6afcb480c6c6915","created_at":"2024-07-07T11:29:59Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
