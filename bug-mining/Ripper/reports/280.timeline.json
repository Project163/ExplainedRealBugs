Hope that's ok!\r\n\r\nThis was caused by https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/blob/8892bf648cfec111e6e7ddd9f30e932b0371db68/ignore/src/walk.rs#L1036-L1040 where you get whether a file is a directory or not using `is_dir()`. When symlinks are not followed, however, this will return `false` even in the case of a symlink that points to a directory. Then, when ripgrep gets an event signaling that the directory listing is over https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/blob/8892bf648cfec111e6e7ddd9f30e932b0371db68/ignore/src/walk.rs#L949-L951 it tries to get the parent `Ignore` object which doesn't exist in this case, causing a panic.","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/comments/537414647/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"nikofil","id":5767669,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3Njc2Njk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5767669?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nikofil","html_url":"https://github.com/nikofil","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nikofil/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nikofil/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nikofil/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nikofil/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nikofil/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nikofil/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nikofil/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nikofil/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nikofil/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":3045032196,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDMwNDUwMzIxOTY=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/events/3045032196","actor":{"login":"BurntSushi","id":456674,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NjY3NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/456674?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi","html_url":"https://github.com/BurntSushi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"f89faf6376d39db2db9561b17ada4ba743ea07c4","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/commits/f89faf6376d39db2db9561b17ada4ba743ea07c4","created_at":"2020-02-17T21:17:41Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3045136812,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MzA0NTEzNjgxMg==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/events/3045136812","actor":{"login":"BurntSushi","id":456674,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NjY3NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/456674?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi","html_url":"https://github.com/BurntSushi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":"52d7f474206eb517c7284448777ed839c0cae8bb","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/commits/52d7f474206eb517c7284448777ed839c0cae8bb","created_at":"2020-02-17T22:16:41Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":13413906938,"node_id":"REFE_lADOAzJbyc4dtzhyzwAAAAMfh_n6","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/events/13413906938","actor":{"login":"kyagi","id":90729,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkwNzI5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/90729?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kyagi","html_url":"https://github.com/kyagi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kyagi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kyagi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kyagi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kyagi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kyagi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kyagi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kyagi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kyagi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kyagi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_adm
