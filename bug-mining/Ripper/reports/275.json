I could implement this by wrapping a single global copy of the data structure in a lock or similar, but that just seems wasteful, since there isn't any need for the threads to interact until the very end. Keeping the partial results local is a classic optimization in parallel programming.\r\n\r\nAs best I can tell, I can pass a local data structure to each thread by building it in the `mkf` function and passing it into the closure I produce. However, I can't figure out any way to get the local data structures back out, in part because I don't see that the threads receive any notice that the walk is ending. The threads just keep getting `DirEntry`s until they don't, and at that point it's already too late to do anything.\r\n\r\nCan you suggest any way to do what I want with `ignore::WalkParallel`? Or if this isn't possible right now, could you consider it as a feature request?\r\n\r\nThanks.","closed_by":{"login":"BurntSushi","id":456674,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NjY3NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/456674?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi","html_url":"https://github.com/BurntSushi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/469/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/469/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
