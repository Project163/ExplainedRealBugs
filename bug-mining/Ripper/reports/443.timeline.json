<b>Bug</b>\r\n\r\nOn all modern versions I could test from 1.80 to 1.83-Insider, on Windows 11, VSCode searches launch rg.exe (ripgrep) processes in parallel with what seems to be a 1:1 mapping to the number of top-level folders in the workspace without pooling/parallel limits (at least none that I could see with up to ~50 folders).\r\n\r\nWith any number of folders however (including just 1) repeated searches will eventually leave one or more rg.exe processes hanging. \r\n\r\nWhen the workspace or VSCode is closed (or even the relevant folder removed from the workspace) this rg.exe becomes orphaned and is completely unkillable through any method I could find: not task manager, process explorer, pskill, taskkill, or wmic. Attempting to takeown and icacls the workspace also has no effect, nor killing every other non-core process in Windows, they're uniquely untouchable and only a reboot evicts them. \r\n\r\nNeedless to say, this isn't ideal, and also mucks up any update process.\r\n\r\nWith a large enough workspace (but nothing over the top, a couple of dozen folders representing different repos) it's fairly easy to trigger this even just by typing with a cadence of ~0.5s per keystoke, which seems to be enough time for the automatic search to kick in, but not enough time for it to complete, which seems to be the most reliable reproducer (and perhaps only method of reproducing).  \r\n\r\nThe greater the folders/size/search result set, the easier it seems to be to achieve this state, but if you're aggressively searching, even one single large folder experiences this with typing `egg<Enter>g<Enter>g<Enter>...` quickly enough.\r\n\r\nI've tried this with standalone installs from the VSCode site and Scoop, both regular and insider releases.\r\n\r\nMay also be related to other issues like #192454 but they've not been closed with any resolution and report wasn't detailed enough to confirm.\r\n\r\n### How it manifests in process explorer\r\n\r\nWhen they first hang, they appear like this as child processes\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/assets/10800163/980e0557-9575-4fde-b4e4-362e82d56419)\r\n\r\nand when the parent processes are eventually killed, they hang around orphaned like this\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/assets/10800163/ccd618b6-cae1-4720-8e94-a8692b284c17)\r\n\r\nI don't know what feature makes these orphans so invincible, there's one Deny flag I can see but a quick scan of other processes shows this isn't unique.\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/assets/10800163/91caf30f-d2a5-4d27-9cf4-c787fce41114)\r\n\r\n## System details\r\n\r\nVS Code version: Code -

I couldn't replicate with the same rg.exe binary outside of the VSCode environment, so I don't think that particular bug is in ripgrep itself, but it unfortunately seems to manifest only due to this check. As it had my attention thought maybe I could add the detail asked for so that this might be picked up?\r\n\r\nRegarding the original suggestion I had to dig into this a lot using ProcMon on Windows to see the generated events while investigating the issue mentioned above (https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/193927), and I see the checks for these compression utilities being the _only_ events generated for a period up to 150ms on my machine as it was. So I'd add some weight to the comment of @Antiever that it could add significant overhead to the overall timing. \r\n\r\nIn essence, if you have everything available, early in the PATH, it's fairly modest, around 10ms. But this requires installing things most Windows users won't have - even users of mingw (Git Bash) which brings brotli and xz - generally wont have zstd and lz4. It takes around 15ms to go through my full PATH stack for each one, so that can easily add 30ms per ms (I've since installed them both via scoop now that I'm aware of this). \r\n\r\nWith some further finagling of my machine and PATH to make sure I have everything available near the front of the PATH (on a high-spec machine but one with a fair number of PATH entries) I can reduce this. If I have installed every one of the utilies it takes 10-15ms per \"batch\" of binary checks. If I miss lz4 and zstd it takes ~35ms. I can't comment on whether this is all it's doing so maybe the actual impact on real-time is less, but it certainly appears to be serially executed according to Windows events at least in that first batch.\r\n\r\n10ms isn't much - but this is only after installing libraries SOLELY to satisfy this check despite them not being used in my use cases. \r\n\r\nIt also seems to be a check run many times. If I run the below monitoring Windows events I see 13 looking for \"C:\\Windows\\lz4.exe\" (brotli, zstd, etc.), 26 for \"C:\\Windows\\gzip.exe\" amd 39 for `xz.exe`. The multiples seems to be because of these lines in `decompress.rs` where ARGS_XZ and ARGS_LZMA both map to the xz process\r\n\r\n```\r\n    add(\"*.xz\", ARGS_XZ, &mut cmds);\r\n    add(\"*.txz\", ARGS_XZ, &mut cmds);\r\n    ...\r\n    add(\"*.lzma\", ARGS_LZMA, &mut cmds);\r\n```\r\n\r\n`d:\\dev\\opt\\scoop\\apps\\vscode-insiders\\1.84.0-insider+1696619477016\\resources\\app\\node_modules.asar.unpacked\\@vscode\\ripgrep\\bin\\rg.exe --no-search-zip -- egggg . > nul 2>&1`\r\n\r\nHowever apart from the first \"batch\" (the 12 checks for 7 binaries, each checking with and without `.exe`) that doesn't seem to affecting timing as all batches after the first seem to be interleaved with actually accessing files so again hard to determine overall impact on time to result but suspect it's negligible.\r\n\r\n```\r\n15:21:12.0380088\trg.exe\t33732\tCreateFile\tC:\\Windows\\gzip\tNAME NOT FOUND\tDesired Access: Read Attributes, Synchronize, Disposition: Open, Options: Synchronous IO Non-Alert, Attributes: n/a, ShareMode: Read, Write, Delete, AllocationSize: n/a\r\n15:21:12.0381672\trg.exe\t33732\tCreateFile\tC:\\Windows\\gzip.exe\tNAME NOT FOUND\tDesired Access: Read Attributes, Synchronize, Disposition: Open, Options: Synchronous IO Non-Alert, Attributes: n/a, ShareMode: Read, Write, Delete, AllocationSize: n/a\r\n15:21:12.0387687\trg.exe\t33732\tCreateFile\tC:\\Windows\\System32\\gzip\tNAME NOT FOUND\tDesired Access: Read Attributes, Synchronize, Disposition: Open, Options: Synchronous IO Non-Alert, Attributes: n/a, ShareMode: Read, Write, Delete, AllocationSize: n/a\r\n15:21:12.0390636\trg.exe\t33732\tCreateFile\tC:\\Windows\\System32\\gzip.exe\tNAME NOT FOUND\tDesired Access: Read Attributes, Synchronize, Disposition: Open, Options: Synchronous IO Non-Alert, Attributes: n/a, ShareMode: Read, Write, Delete, AllocationSize: n/a\r\n15:21:12.0391482\trg.exe\t33732\tCreateFile\tC:\\Windows\\System32\\wbem\\gzip\tNAME NOT FOUND\tDesired Access: Read Attributes, Synchronize, Disposition: Open, Options: Synchronous IO Non-Alert, Attributes: n/a, ShareMode: Read, Write, Delete, AllocationSize: n/a\r\n15:21:12.0392555\trg.exe\t33732\tCreateFile\tC:\\Windows\\System32\\wbem\\gzip.exe\tNAME NOT FOUND\tDesired Access: Read Attributes, Synchronize, Disposition: Open, Options: Synchronous IO Non-Alert, Attributes: n/a, ShareMode: Read, Write, Delete, AllocationSize: n/a\r\n15:21:12.0396079\trg.exe\t33732\tCreateFile\tC:\\Program Files\\Git\\usr\\bin\\gzip\tNAME NOT FOUND\tDesired Access: Read Attributes, Synchronize, Disposition: Open, Options: Synchronous IO Non-Alert, Attributes: n/a, ShareMode: Read, Write, Delete, AllocationSize: n/a\r\n...\r\n15:21:12.0721815\trg.exe\t33732\tCreateFile\tC:\\Program Files\\Git\\usr\\bin\\uncompress\tSUCCESS\tDesired Access: Read Attributes, Synchronize, Disposition: Open, Options: Synchronous IO Non-Alert, Attributes: n/a, ShareMode: Read, Write, Delete, AllocationSize: n/a, OpenResult: Opened\r\n15:21:12.0722041\trg.exe\t33732\tQueryInformationVolume\tC:\\Program Files\\Git\\usr\\bin\\uncompress\tBUFFER OVERFLOW\tVolumeCreationTime: 22/12/2020 10:02:21, VolumeSerialNumber: 388A-40A8, SupportsObjects: True, VolumeLabel: WinＡ\u0002燸\r\n15:21:12.0722126\trg.exe\t33732\tQueryAllInformationFile\tC:\\Program Files\\Git\\usr\\bin\\uncompress\tBUFFER OVERFLOW\tCreationTime: 26/03/2023 12:11:15, LastAccessTime: 21/06/2023 16:27:50, LastWriteTime: 14/03/2023 06:10:34, ChangeTime: 26/03/2023 12:11:15, FileAttributes: A, AllocationSize: 4,096, EndOfFile: 2,346\r\n15:21:12.0722229\trg.exe\t33732\tCloseFile\tC:\\Program Files\\Git\\usr\\bin\\uncompress\tSUCCESS\t\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nAs I say, from a typical user's perspective (of the type on Windows who uses ripgrep, so probably has Git Bash but probably hasn't tuned their PATH to stop all the Windows application guff that front-runs normally) it certainly appears judging by Windows filesystem calls seems to be adding in the range of 30-150ms where these checks seem to be the only thing done, which can be a material part of the time.\r\n\r\nNot sure if I can add anything more. I'm not really in a position to try compiling with and without these checks nor familiar enough with the code to know how much of the overall duration of a query on Windows is really due to this but I feel like the above is enough to show a real-world, material impact of timing on a typical Windows user's setup?\r\n\r\nRegarding the VSCode-ripgrep issue I believe it's one for them to look into but just to summarise, if it's of interest, the replicating conditions are: in VSCode running a search, or multiple searches, which uses rg.exe in the backend seemingly as a Node module, spawning several `rg.exe` processes concurrently AND having on one's PATH a network drive (possibly only a Google Drive mount) that is searched. As far as I can tell this just happens to be the trigger but it's unfortunate when it is actually unnecessary given how it's used in VSCode.","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/comments/1793793703/reactions","total_count":3,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":3,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"nikgoodley-ibboost","id":10800163,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwODAwMTYz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10800163?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nikgoodley-ibboost","html_url":"https://github.com/nikgoodley-ibboost","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nikgoodley-ibboost/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nikgoodley-ibboost/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nikgoodley-ibboost/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nikgoodley-ibboost/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nikgoodley-ibboost/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nikgoodley-ibboost/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nikgoodley-ibboost/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nikgoodley-ibboost/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nikgoodley-ibboost/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":10865421986,"node_id":"MEE_lADOAzJbyc5AuWLJzwAAAAKHoS6i","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/events/10865421986","actor":{"login":"Antiever","id":9666515,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk2NjY1MTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9666515?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Antiever","html_url":"https://github.com/Antiever","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Antiever/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Antiever/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Antiever/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Antiever/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Antiever/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Antiever/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Antiever/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Antiever/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Antiever/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2023-11-05T17:10:25Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":10865421987,"node_id":"SE_lADOAzJbyc5AuWLJzwAAAAKHoS6j","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/events/10865421987","actor":{"login":"Antiever","id":9666515,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk2NjY1MTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9666515?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Antiever","html_url":"https://github.com/Antiever","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Antiever/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Antiever/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Antiever/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Antiever/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Antiever/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Antiever/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Antiever/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Antiever/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Antiever/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2023-11-05T17:10:25Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":18197323365,"node_id":"SE_lADOAzJbyc5AuWLJzwAAAAQ8pR5l","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/events/18197323365","actor":{"login":"DenialAdams","id":2072405,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwNzI0MDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2072405?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/DenialAdams","html_url":"https://github.com/DenialAdams","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DenialAdams/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DenialAdams/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DenialAdams/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DenialAdams/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DenialAdams/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DenialAdams/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DenialAdams/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DenialAdams/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DenialAdams/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2025-06-17T19:52:31Z","performed_via_gi

with `brew bump-formula-pr`.<details>\n  <summary>release notes</summary>\n  <pre>[Sponsorship is appreciated!](https://github.com/sponsors/BurntSushi/)\r\n\r\nripgrep 15 is a new major version release of ripgrep that mostly has bug fixes,\r\nsome minor performance improvements and minor new features.\r\n\r\n> In case you haven't heard of it before, ripgrep is a line-oriented search\r\n> tool that recursively searches the current directory for a regex pattern.\r\n> By default, ripgrep will respect gitignore rules and automatically skip\r\n> hidden files/directories and binary files.\r\n\r\nHere are some highlights:\r\n\r\n* Several bugs around gitignore matching have been fixed. This includes\r\n  a commonly reported bug related to applying gitignore rules from parent\r\n  directories.\r\n* A memory usage regression when handling very large gitignore files has been\r\n  fixed.\r\n* `rg -vf file`, where `file` is empty, now matches everything.\r\n* The `-r/--replace` flag now works with `--json`.\r\n* A subset of Jujutsu (`jj`) repositories are now treated as if they were git\r\n  repositories. That is, ripgrep will respect `jj`'s gitignores.\r\n* Globs can now use nested curly braces.\r\n\r\nPlatform support:\r\n\r\n* `aarch64` for Windows now has release artifacts.\r\n* `powerpc64` no longer has release artifacts generated for it. The CI\r\n  release workflow stopped working, and I didn't deem it worth my time to\r\n  debug it. If someone wants this and can test it, I'd be happy to add it\r\n  back.\r\n* ripgrep binaries are now compiled with full LTO enabled. You may notice\r\n  small performance improvements from this and a modest decrease in binary\r\n  size.\r\n\r\nPerformance improvements:\r\n\r\n* [PERF #2111](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/2111):\r\n  Don't resolve helper binaries on Windows when `-z/--search-zip` isn't used.\r\n* [PERF #2865](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/pull/2865):\r\n  Avoid using path canonicalization on Windows when emitting hyperlinks.\r\n* [PERF #3184](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/pull/3184):\r\n  Improve performance of large values with `-A/--after-context`.\r\n\r\nBug fixes:\r\n\r\n* [BUG
