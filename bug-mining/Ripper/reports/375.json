I immediately checked `.gitignore` and `.ignore` files in the current directory and there was nothing that would have filtered out my source. Testing again with `--no-ignore` showed the content I was expecting.\r\n\r\nI'm assuming this is the intended behavior? I couldn't find any reference in the docs to `ripgrep` going **up** the tree looking for `.ignore` files. I would maybe expect it to look in each sub directory, but not go up. If this is not a bug then the [documentation](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/blob/a7ae9e4043533ba1b6e2f63b989b84f27d961b37/doc/rg.1.txt.tpl#L122) should be updated to indicate that ","closed_by":{"login":"BurntSushi","id":456674,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NjY3NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/456674?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi","html_url":"https://github.com/BurntSushi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/2479/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/2479/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
