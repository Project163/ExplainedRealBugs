File paths went from green to magenta, line numbers went from blue to green and matches stayed as red. Both paths and line numbers are no longer bolded, but matches remain bolded. This color scheme generally matches GNU grep's color scheme.\r\n\r\nSecondly, I fixed a bungling of intense colors. Namely, if a bold color was specified, then an intense color was used instead of emitting the bold ANSI escape sequence. Therefore, I added a new style `intense` to distinguish between the colors.\r\n\r\nYou can try fiddling with intensity and boldness like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ rg --colors path:style:intense --colors line:style:bold\r\n```","author_association":"OWNER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/comments/273346047/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"BurntSushi","id":456674,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NjY3NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/456674?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi","html_url":"https://github.com/BurntSushi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":926736675,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50OTI2NzM2Njc1","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/events/926736675","actor":{"login":"BurntSushi","id":456674,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NjY3NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/456674?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi","html_url":"https://github.com/BurntSushi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":"b04a68a782467658b601b86f9b2048b420ee23aa","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/commits/b04a68a782467658b601b86f9b2048b420ee23aa","created_at":"2017-01-18T00:34:35Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
