smaller reproduction of this bug:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ rg ZZZZZ ruby-2.5.1/test/rexml/data/t63-2.svg\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt turns out that this svg file starts with a UTF-16LE BOM, but does not actually appear to be UTF-16. In any case, this trips over a corner case in the streaming transcoder that in turn causes a panic. The fault is either in my implementation of the streaming transcoder (by not upholding some precondition of the transcoder) or in the implementation of the encoding handling itself. Either way, I filed a bug to get to the bottom of it: https://github.com/hsivonen/encoding_rs/issues/34\r\n\r\nFor now, I [patched this via a work-around in the streaming transcoder](https://github.com/BurntSushi/encoding_rs_io/commit/8405b0f9aeacd35dfdb3f02a522454eb25ee3773), although it's not clear that the root cause has been fixed. PR #1065 brings in the workaround to ripgrep.\r\n\r\nThanks so much for reporting this!","author_association":"OWNER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/comments/424173549/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"BurntSushi","id":456674,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NjY3NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/456674?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi","html_url":"https://github.com/BurntSushi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":1866856464,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MTg2Njg1NjQ2NA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/events/1866856464","actor":{"login":"BurntSushi","id":456674,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NjY3NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/456674?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi","html_url":"https://github.com/BurntSushi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-09-25T20:56:05Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":1866856555,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDE4NjY4NTY1NTU=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/events/1866856555","actor":{"login":"BurntSushi","id":456674,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NjY3NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/456674?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi","html_url":"https://github.com/BurntSushi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"ba533f390edbad39a334c3fb8b56f839642292ee","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/commits/ba533f390edbad39a334c3fb8b56f839642292ee","created_at":"2018-09-25T20:56:08Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"actor":{"login":"comex","id":47517,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3NTE3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47517?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/comex","html_url":"https://github.com/comex","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/comex/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/comex/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/comex/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/comex/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/comex/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/comex/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/comex/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/comex/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/comex/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-10-22T00:22:59Z","updated_at":"2018-10-22T00:22:59Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/1089","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/
