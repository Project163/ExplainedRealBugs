I want to fix this issue but I'm not sure what the best way is. I understand the _technical_ issues at play, but I'm concerned more about the user experience here. Let me describe what I think is the problem.\n\nToday, if I'm on Linux and I want to download a Linux binary for ripgrep, I click on the \"releases\" link and there is exactly one choice that makes sense: `ripgrep-0.2.9-x86_64-unknown-linux-musl.tar.gz`.\n\nIn the future, if we add different downloads for various flavors of SIMD support, then will be multiple choices and none of them will be obvious. For example, you might have to choose between `ripgrep-0.2.9-x86_64-unknown-linux-musl.tar.gz` and `ripgrep-0.2.9-x86_64-unknown-linux-musl-ssse3.tar.gz`. As a user of command line search tools, I have no idea what SIMD is or what SSSE3 means or whether my system supports it. Therefore, I will choose `ripgrep-0.2.9-x86_64-unknown-linux-musl.tar.gz`. (Which is likely the wrong choice in the vast majority of cases.)\n\nHow can I fix this? I could add some notes about this in the release page, but I feel like that will be ineffective.\n","author_association":"OWNER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/comments/261719264/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"BurntSushi","id":456674,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NjY3NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/456674?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi","html_url":"https://github.com/BurntSushi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":865362455,"node_id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDg2NTM2MjQ1NQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/events/865362455","actor":{"login":"BurntSushi","id":456674,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NjY3NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/456674?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi","html_url":"https://github.com/BurntSushi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2016-11-19T15:10:43Z","label":{"name":"question","color":"cc317c"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/comments/271502853","html_url":"https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/135#issuecomment-271502853","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/135","id":271502853,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI3MTUwMjg1Mw==","user":{"login":"acmay","id":1786758,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3ODY3NTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1786758?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/acmay","html_url":"https://github.com/acmay","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/acmay/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/acmay/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/acmay/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/acmay/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/acmay/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/acmay/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/acmay/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/acmay/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/acmay/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-01-10T07:12:04Z","updated_at":"2017-01-10T07:12:04Z","body":"It is not unheard of to have a program do run time detection of the supported instruction set and pick the correct functions as needed. Openssl with AES instruction support is one example. VLC and other video players are another good source of examples. Here they actually fork and test the instruction works since they don't trust the CPU ID bits to be correct. https://mailman.videolan.org/pipermail/vlc-devel/2009-September/066544.html\r\n\r\nSo the general solution may be to create one binary that detects and loads the correct arch specific module. I have no idea how to do that in rust, but I would like to hope it is possible without too many hoops. And hopefully it is just a small subset of the code that really needs the instructions for the performance boost.","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/comments/271502853/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"acmay","id":1786758,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3ODY3NTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1786758?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/acmay","html_url":"https://github.com/acmay","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/acmay/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/acmay/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/acmay/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/acmay/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/acmay/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/acmay/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/acmay/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/acmay/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/acmay/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/comments/271559532","html_url":"https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/135#issuecomment-271559532","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/135","id":271559532,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI3MTU1OTUzMg==","user":{"login":"BurntSushi","id":456674,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NjY3NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/456674?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi","html_url":"https://github.com/BurntSushi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-01-10T12:08:27Z","updated_at":"2017-01-10T12:08:27Z","body":"@acmay Ah, thanks for the update! Yup, Rust has a few cpuid crates that we could use to avoid running SSSE3 code if it's not available. The problem is actually a bit more sinister then that though. In particular, if I compile a binary using the equivalent of `-mssse3`, then that enables SSSE3 based optimizations *everywhere*.\r\n\r\nThe only way to solve this problem for real is using target specific function attributes. (Which I just recently added to the Rust compiler.) This allows one to use SSSE3 vendor intrinsics on a function-by-function level without actually passing `-mssse3` as a compile-time flag. We can then use, e.g., cpuid to dispatch.","author_association":"OWNER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/comments/271559532/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"BurntSushi","id":456674,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NjY3NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/456674?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi","html_url":"https://github.com/BurntSushi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":917402262,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50OTE3NDAyMjYy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/events/917402262","actor":{"login":"acmay","id":1786758,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3ODY3NTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1786758?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/acmay","html_url":"https://github.com/acmay","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/acmay/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/acmay/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/acmay/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/acmay/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/acmay/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/acmay/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/acmay/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/acmay/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/acmay/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2017-01-10T12:08:27Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":917402263,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDkxNzQwMjI2Mw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/events/917402263","actor":{"login":"acmay","id":1786758,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3ODY3NTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1786758?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/acmay","html_url":"https://github.com/acmay","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/acmay/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/acmay/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/acmay/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/acmay/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/acmay/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/acmay/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/acmay/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/acmay/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/acmay/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2017-01-10T12:08:27Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"actor":{"login":"BurntSushi","id":456674,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NjY3NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/456674?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi","html_url":"https://github.com/BurntSushi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-01-17T23:09:31Z","updated_at":"2017-01-17T23:09:31Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/331","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/331/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/331/comments","events_url":"http
