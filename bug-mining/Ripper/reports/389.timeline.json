But read on.\r\n\r\nFor your second example, I'd consider those times close enough (especially on such a small corpus) that they are effectively the same. But in any case, ripgrep is faster for me:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ hyperfine 'rg -i \"[A-Z0-9._%+-]*vid[A-Z0-9._%+-]*@[a-z]+\\.[a-z]{2,}\"'\r\nBenchmark #1: rg -i \"[A-Z0-9._%+-]*vid[A-Z0-9._%+-]*@[a-z]+\\.[a-z]{2,}\"\r\n  Time (mean ± σ):      19.5 ms ±   1.4 ms    [User: 115.1 ms, System: 22.6 ms]\r\n  Range (min … max):    16.2 ms …  23.5 ms    115 runs\r\n\r\n$ hyperfine 'grep -riE \"[A-Z0-9._%+-]*vid[A-Z0-9._%+-]*@[a-z]+\\.[a-z]{2,}\"'\r\nBenchmark #1: grep -riE \"[A-Z0-9._%+-]*vid[A-Z0-9._%+-]*@[a-z]+\\.[a-z]{2,}\"\r\n  Time (mean ± σ):      46.3 ms ±   1.1 ms    [User: 25.3 ms, System: 20.7 ms]\r\n  Range (min … max):    43.6 ms …  48.7 ms    58 runs\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow, your first example is more interesting. That's a substantial difference. On my machine, ripgrep runs a hair faster, but they're effectively tied:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ hyperfine --ignore-failure 'rg -i \"[A-Z0-9._%+-]*lin[A-Z0-9._%+-]*tor[A-Z0-9._%+-]*@[a-z]+\\.[a-z]{2,}\"'\r\nBenchmark #1: rg -i \"[A-Z0-9._%+-]*lin[A-Z0-9._%+-]*tor[A-Z0-9._%+-]*@[a-z]+\\.[a-z]{2,}\"\r\n  Time (mean ± σ):      40.1 ms ±   1.6 ms    [User: 364.8 ms, System: 22.6 ms]\r\n  Range (min … max):    36.7 ms …  44.4 ms    65 runs\r\n\r\n  Warning: Ignoring non-zero exit code.\r\n\r\n$ hyperfine --ignore-failure 'grep -riE \"[A-Z0-9._%+-]*lin[A-Z0-9._%+-]*tor[A-Z0-9._%+-]*@[a-z]+\\.[a-z]{2,}\"'\r\nBenchmark #1: grep -riE \"[A-Z0-9._%+-]*lin[A-Z0-9._%+-]*tor[A-Z0-9._%+-]*@[a-z]+\\.[a-z]{2,}\"\r\n  Time (mean ± σ):      46.8 ms ±   1.4 ms    [User: 24.0 ms, System: 22.3 ms]\r\n  Range (min … max):    43.9 ms …  50.7 ms    59 runs\r\n\r\n  Warning: Ignoring non-zero exit code.\r\n```\r\n\r\nDo you perhaps have a ripgrep config file that is running ripgrep single threaded? If I force ripgrep into a single thread, then it gets closer to your reproduction:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ hyperfine 'rg -i -j1 \"[A-Z0-9._%+-]*vid[A-Z0-9._%+-]*@[a-z]+\\.[a-z]{2,}\"'\r\nBenchmark #1: rg -i -j1 \"[A-Z0-9._%+-]*vid[A-Z0-9._%+-]*@[a-z]+\\.[a-z]{2,}\"\r\n  Time (mean ± σ):      91.7 ms ±   5.4 ms    [User: 71.1 ms, System: 20.3 ms]\r\n  Range (min … max):    75.7 ms …  98.1 ms    29 runs\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd if I have ripgrep search the same set of files as grep, then a real difference can be observed:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ hyperfine 'rg -i -j1 -uuu \"[A-Z0-9._%+-]*vid[A-Z0-9._%+-]*@[a-z]+\\.[a-z]{2,}\"'\r\nBenchmark #1: rg -i -j1 -uuu \"[A-Z0-9._%+-]*vid[A-Z0-9._%+-]*@[a-z]+\\.[a-z]{2,}\"\r\n  Time (mean ± σ):     151.0 ms ±  10.4 ms    [User: 129.2 ms, System: 21.3 ms]\r\n  Range (min … max):   140.5 ms … 168.4 ms    17 runs\r\n```\r\n\r\nOK, let's see if this is a regex engine problem or a directory traversal problem. Easiest way to do that is to see if we can reproduce the performance difference on a single file. So I've just concatenated all of the files in `linux/fs` into a single file. And to make differences more pronounced (and eliminate the effects of noise), I've made the file 10x bigger:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ find ./ -type f -print0 | xargs -0 cat > /tmp/linux-fs-all\r\n$ for ((i=0;i<10;i++)); do cat /tmp/linux-fs-all; done > /tmp/linux-fs-all.10x\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe first thing to note is that there is some binary data:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ grep -iE \"[A-Z0-9._%+-]*vid[A-Z0-9._%+-]*@[a-z]+\\.[a-z]{2,}\" /tmp/linux-fs-all.10x\r\ngrep: /tmp/linux-fs-all.10x: binary file matches\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo let's use the `-a/--text` flag and see if we can re-create the performance difference on a single file:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ time grep -aciE \"[A-Z0-9._%+-]*vid[A-Z0-9._%+-]*@[a-z]+\\.[a-z]{2,}\" /tmp/linux-fs-all.10x\r\n100\r\n\r\nreal    0.295\r\nuser    0.199\r\nsys     0.096\r\nmaxmem  7 MB\r\nfaults  0\r\n\r\n$ time rg -aci \"[A-Z0-9._%+-]*vid[A-Z0-9._%+-]*@[a-z]+\\.[a-z]{2,}\" /tmp/linux-fs-all.10x\r\n100\r\n\r\nreal    1.249\r\nuser    1.231\r\nsys     0.017\r\nmaxmem  580 MB\r\nfaults  0\r\n```\r\n\r\nGreat, got it. Running it under `perf` shows the total time split between Teddy (a fast literal prefilter) and the regex engine. My first thought is whether this is a case where ripgrep's more aggressive literal optimizations result in it being slower than grep. To figure that out, we need to find 1) which literals ripgrep is searching for and 2) whether they have a lot of matches or not. We can do (1) by running ripgrep with the `--trace` flag:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ rg -aci \"[A-Z0-9._%+-]*vid[A-Z0-9._%+-]*@[a-z]+\\.[a-z]{2,}\" /tmp/linux-fs-all.10x --trace\r\n...\r\nDEBUG|grep_regex::literal|crates/regex/src/literal.rs:109: required literals found: [Cut(VID), Cut(vID), Cut(ViD), Cut(viD), Cut(VId), Cut(vId), Cut(Vid), Cut(vid), Cut(@), Cut(.)]\r\nDEBUG|grep_regex::matcher|crates/regex/src/matcher.rs:50: extracted fast line regex: (?-u:VID|vID|ViD|viD|VId|vId|Vid|vid|@|\\x2e)\r\n...\r\n```\r\n\r\nYeah... That doesn't look so good. Let's see how often the \"fast line regex\" matches:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ time rg -c '(?-u:VID|vID|ViD|viD|VId|vId|Vid|vid|@|\\x2e)' /tmp/linux-fs-all.10x\r\n4489830\r\n\r\nreal    0.722\r\nuser    0.701\r\nsys     0.020\r\nmaxmem  580 MB\r\nfaults  0\r\n```\r\n\r\nYikes. That is almost certainly the problem. The killers are the `@` and `.` literals that were extracted, because they make up the vast majority of all false positives. (`0x2E` is ASCII for `.`.) If we remove them from the literal search, the number of matches drops precipitously:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ time rg -c '(?-u:VID|vID|ViD|viD|VId|vId|Vid|vid)' /tmp/linux-fs-all.10x\r\n24320\r\n\r\nreal    0.157\r\nuser    0.139\r\nsys     0.017\r\nmaxmem  580 MB\r\nfaults  0\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor grins, observe how ripgrep is actually faster than GNU grep on these specific queries:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ time grep -cE '(?-u:VID|vID|ViD|viD|VId|vId|Vid|vid|@|\\.)' /tmp/linux-fs-all.10x\r\n4773860\r\n\r\nreal    1.098\r\nuser    0.990\r\nsys     0.107\r\nmaxmem  7 MB\r\nfaults  0\r\n\r\n$ time grep -cE '(?-u:VID|vID|ViD|viD|VId|vId|Vid|vid)' /tmp/linux-fs-all.10x\r\n22320\r\n\r\nreal    0.963\r\nuser    0.895\r\nsys     0.067\r\nmaxmem  7 MB\r\nfaults  0\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe problem here is that ripgrep's heuristic optimization is sub-optimal in this case. These sorts of things are difficult to fix, because fixing it for one case might actually result in making other cases slower. One possible fix would be to just remove `@` and `.` from the set of literals we search. And indeed this is a correct transformation in this case. And removing things like that is probably a smart thing to do anyway, since they are very common. Well, at least `.` is. `@` is common in some corpora and not others. We can see what performance _could_ be like by replacing `@` and `.` with `\\S` to defeat the literal detection:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ time rg -aci \"[A-Z0-9._%+-]*vid[A-Z0-9._%+-]*\\S[a-z]+\\S[a-z]{2,}\" /tmp/linux-fs-all.10x\r\n10760\r\n\r\nreal    0.144\r\nuser    0.100\r\nsys     0.043\r\nmaxmem  581 MB\r\nfaults  0\r\n```\r\n\r\nObviously it doesn't produce the same results, but if you put it together into a pipeline...\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ time rg -ai \"[A-Z0-9._%+-]*vid[A-Z0-9._%+-]*\\S[a-z]+\\S[a-z]{2,}\" /tmp/linux-fs-all.10x | rg -aci '[A-Z0-9._%+-]*vid[A-Z0-9._%+-]*@[a-z]+\\.[a-z]{2,}'\r\n100\r\n\r\nreal    0.168\r\nuser    0.134\r\nsys     0.034\r\nmaxmem  579 MB\r\nfaults  0\r\n```\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, while removing `.` and `@` from the literal detection is conceptually simple, the code for extracting literals is not really flexible enough to do this easily. I've been meaning to rewrite it for years, but it's pretty thorny.\r\n\r\nAnyway, good find and thank you for the great report!","author_association":"OWNER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/comments/734889014/reactions","total_count":29,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":29,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"BurntSushi","id":456674,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NjY3NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/456674?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi","html_url":"https://github.com/BurntSushi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":4046591247,"node_id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDQwNDY1OTEyNDc=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/events/4046591247","actor":{"login":"BurntSushi","id":456674,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NjY3NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/456674?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi","html_url":"https://github.com/BurntSushi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-11-27T15:37:19Z","label":{"name":"bug","color":"fc2929"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/comments/1826396754","html_url":"https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/1746#issuecomment-1826396754","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/1746","id":1826396754,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAzJbyc5s3JpS","user":{"login":"BurntSushi","id":456674,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NjY3NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/456674?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi","html_url":"https://github.com/BurntSushi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-11-25T18:48:14Z","updated_at":"2023-11-25T18:48:14Z","body":"This should be improved quite a bit in the ripgrep 14 release.

Explaining this is tricky, but I'll try:\r\n\r\n1. At time of writing, ripgrep master still tries to detect inner literals from the regex pattern (as it has always done). But, the regex engine has also grown more sophisticated inner literal detection, and ripgrep's inner literal extractor only runs if the regex engine's own detector fails. (ripgrep's is more flexible because of line oriented search.)\r\n2. In this case, the regex engine thinks its inner literal extraction is good. Indeed, it is, and it extracts the same literals as the ripgrep's extractor. That is, `(?i:vid)`. Thus, ripgrep defers to the regex engine and doesn't try to do its own optimization. This is usually fine.\r\n3. Even the regex engine extracts the same literals, in order for the optimization to work in the context of a general regex engine, it has to put up some safeguards to avoid worst case quadratic behavior. Those safeguards end up activating in this benchmark which forces ripgrep to, in some cases, fall back to a non-literal accelerated search.\r\n4. The non-mmap version runs faster because ripgrep searches smaller buffers. So by a twist of fate, it spends less time in the non-accelerated regex engine than it does in the mmap version.\r\n\r\nThe main issue preventing improvement here is unfortunately abstraction boundaries. ripgrep can't really know exactly what the regex engine plans to do and how it might be sub-optimal here. The regex engine could expose something about its plan, but I'm hesitant to do such things because it is an implementation detail.\r\n\r\nProbably the next step here is figuring out how to push ripgrep's more flexible inner literal optimization down into the regex engine so that everyone who uses the regex engine can benefit from it when doing line oriented search.\r\n\r\nBut I'm calling

by `brew bump`\n\n---\n\nCreated with `brew bump-formula-pr`.<details>\n  <summary>release notes</summary>\n  <pre>ripgrep 14 is a new major version release of ripgrep that has some new\r\nfeatures, performance improvements and a lot of bug fixes.\r\n\r\n> In case you haven't heard of it before, ripgrep is a line-oriented search\r\n> tool that recursively searches the current directory for a regex pattern.\r\n> By default, ripgrep will respect gitignore rules and automatically skip\r\n> hidden files/directories and binary files.\r\n\r\nThe headling feature in this release is hyperlink support. In this release,\r\nthey are an opt-in feature but may change to an opt-out feature in the future.\r\nTo enable them, try passing `--hyperlink-format default`. If you use [VS Code],\r\nthen try passing `--hyperlink-format vscode`. Please [report your experience\r\nwith hyperlinks][report-hyperlinks], positive or negative.\r\n\r\n[VS Code]: https://code.visualstudio.com/\r\n[report-hyperlinks]: https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/discussions/2611\r\n\r\nAnother headling development in this release is that it contains a rewrite of\r\nits regex engine. You generally shouldn't notice any changes, except for some\r\nsearches may get faster. You can read more about the [regex engine rewrite on\r\nmy blog][regex-internals]. Please [report your performance improvements or\r\nregressions that you notice][report-perf].\r\n\r\n[report-perf]: https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/discussions/2652\r\n\r\nFinally, ripgrep switched the library it uses for argument parsing. Users\r\nshould not notice a difference in most cases (error messages have changed\r\nsomewhat), but flag overrides should generally be more consistent. For example,\r\nthings like `--no-ignore --ignore-vcs` work as one would expect (disables all\r\nfiltering related to ignore rules except for rules found in version control\r\nsystems such as `git`).\r\n\r\n[regex-internals]: https://blog.burntsushi.net/regex-internals/\r\n\r\n**BREAKING CHANGES**:\r\n\r\n* `rg -C1 -A2` used to be equivalent to `rg -A2`, but now it is equivalent to\r\n  `rg -B1 -A2`. That is, `-A` and `-B` no longer completely override `-C`.\r\n  Instead, they only partially override `-C`.\r\n\r\nBuild process changes:\r\n\r\n* ripgrep's shell completions and man page are now created by running ripgrep\r\nwith a new `--generate` flag. For example, `rg --generate man` will write a\r\nman page in `roff` format on stdout. The release archives have not changed.\r\n* The optional build dependency on `asciidoc` or `asciidoctor` has been\r\ndropped. Previously, it was used to produce ripgrep's man page. ripgrep now\r\nowns this process itself by writing `roff` directly.\r\n\r\nPerformance improvements:\r\n\r\n* [PERF #1746](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/1746):\r\n  Make some cases with inner literals faster.\r\n* [PERF #1760](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/1760):\r\n  Make most searches with `\\b` look-arounds (among others) much faster.\r\n* [PERF #2591](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/pull/2591):\r\n  Parallel directory traversal now uses work stealing for faster searches.\r\n* [PERF #2642](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/pull/2642):\r\n  Parallel directory traversal has some contention reduced.\r\n\r\nFeature enhancements:\r\n\r\n* Added or improved file type filtering for Ada, DITA, Elixir, Fuchsia, Gentoo,\r\n  Gradle, GraphQL, Markdown, Prolog, Raku, TypeScript, USD, V\r\n* [FEATURE #665](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/665):\r\n  Add a new `--hyperlink-format` flag that turns file paths into hyperlinks.\r\n* [FEATURE #1709](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/1709):\r\n  Improve documentation of ripgrep's behavior when stdout is a tty.\r\n* [FEATURE #1737](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/1737):\r\n  Provide binaries for Apple silicon.\r\n* [FEATURE #1790](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/1790):\r\n  Add new `--stop-on-nonmatch` flag.\r\n* [FEATURE #1814](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/1814):\r\n  Flags are now categorized in `-h/--help` output and ripgrep's man page.\r\n* [FEATURE #1838](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/1838):\r\n  An error is shown when searching for NUL bytes with binary detection enabled.\r\n* [FEATURE #2195](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/2195):\r\n  When `extra-verbose` mode is enabled in zsh, show extra file type info.\r\n* [FEATURE #2298](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/2298):\r\n  Add instructions for installing ripgrep using `cargo binstall`.\r\n* [FEATURE #2409](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/pull/2409):\r\n  Added installation instructions for `winget`.\r\n* [FEATURE #2425](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/pull/2425):\r\n  Shell completions (and man page) can be created via `rg --generate`.\r\n* [FEATURE #2524](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/2524):\r\n  The `--debug` flag now indicates whether stdin or `./` is being searched.\r\n* [FEATURE #2643](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/2643):\r\n  Make `-d` a short flag for `--max-depth`.\r\n* [FEATURE #2645](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/2645):\r\n  The `--version` output will now also contain PCRE2 availability information.\r\n\r\nBug fixes:\r\n\r\n* [BUG
