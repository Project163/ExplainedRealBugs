For specific details, you can see this issue:\r\nhttps://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/42174\r\n\r\nThe issue seems to be, `ripgrep` is not ignoring the same files and folders as `git`.  If this is intended behavior, it isn't really stated as the documentation simply states it will be \"respecting your gitignore rules.\"  Currently, if I have a structure as the following:\r\n```\r\n- path1/\r\n  - file_to_exclude_1\r\n  - file_to_exclude_2\r\n  - file_to_exclude_3\r\n- path2/\r\n  - file_to_include_1\r\n  - path1/\r\n    - file_to_include_2\r\n```\r\nIf I also have a `.gitignore` which has the following entry:\r\n```\r\npath1/*\r\n```\r\n`git` will only ignore `./path1` in the Root of the project and not `./path2/path1`.  `ripgrep` seems to be ignoring both `./path1` and `./path2/path1` which is inconsistent with what `git` ignores when using these rules.","closed_by":{"login":"BurntSushi","id":456674,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NjY3NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/456674?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi","html_url":"https://github.com/BurntSushi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/761/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/761/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
