(Thanks for both of these crates!)\r\n\r\nThere's one piece of functionality that isn't easy to replicate with `ignore`, which is skipping files and directories on MacOS if they're hidden by attribute. I had written my own function to check if files were hidden, and then applied it with the `filter_entry` iterator combinator from `walkdir`.\r\n\r\nIt looks like `ignore` checks for the hidden attribute on Windows, but not MacOS, and it doesn't expose `filter_entry` from walkdir.\r\n\r\nWhat do you think about adding support for checking the macos hidden attribute? I'd be happy to contribute this as a PR. Or possibly is there something in the API that I've missed that allows filtering entries?\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, my implementation of checking the hidden attribute involves unsafe code, and I don't think there's a safe alternative.
