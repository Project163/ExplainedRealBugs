it does search .tar.gz files.  For example:\r\n```\r\n> rg --binary -l -z  '\\bsigevent\\b'\r\npgx-pg-sys-0.1.1.tar.gz\r\nrust-mio-0.1.0.tar.gz\r\nlibc-0.2.80.tar.gz\r\n...\r\n```\r\nDo you mean that it won't display the matching lines?  I wouldn't expect that.  That's why I'm using `-l`.","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/comments/1165792330/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"asomers","id":129721,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyOTcyMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/129721?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/asomers","html_url":"https://github.com/asomers","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asomers/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asomers/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asomers/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asomers/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asomers/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asomers/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asomers/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asomers/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asomers/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/comments/1165806437","html_url":"https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/2246#issuecomment-1165806437","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/2246","id":1165806437,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAzJbyc5FfMtl","user":{"login":"BurntSushi","id":456674,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NjY3NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/456674?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi","html_url":"https://github.com/BurntSushi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-06-24T17:58:20Z","updated_at":"2022-06-24T17:58:20Z","body":"I didn't say ripgrep doesn't search .tar.gz files. Please read what I said more carefully. What I said was, ripgrep doesn't search archives like you might be expected it to. ripgrep searches `.tar` files like any other kind of file. What it doesn't do is extract archives into its constituent parts.\r\n\r\nripgrep sees the `.gz` extension and decompresses the `.tar.gz` file. That decompressed file is a tar archive. That tar archive, _in its decompressed state_, is itself a binary file. ripgrep will treat it like a binary file. This is correct and its **totally and completely orthogonal to whether it was originally compressed or not**.\r\n\r\nThe fact that a `.tar.gz` file decompresses to a binary file is a consequent of that specific file.

by `brew bump`\n\n---\n\nCreated with `brew bump-formula-pr`.<details>\n  <summary>release notes</summary>\n  <pre>ripgrep 14 is a new major version release of ripgrep that has some new\r\nfeatures, performance improvements and a lot of bug fixes.\r\n\r\n> In case you haven't heard of it before, ripgrep is a line-oriented search\r\n> tool that recursively searches the current directory for a regex pattern.\r\n> By default, ripgrep will respect gitignore rules and automatically skip\r\n> hidden files/directories and binary files.\r\n\r\nThe headling feature in this release is hyperlink support. In this release,\r\nthey are an opt-in feature but may change to an opt-out feature in the future.\r\nTo enable them, try passing `--hyperlink-format default`. If you use [VS Code],\r\nthen try passing `--hyperlink-format vscode`. Please [report your experience\r\nwith hyperlinks][report-hyperlinks], positive or negative.\r\n\r\n[VS Code]: https://code.visualstudio.com/\r\n[report-hyperlinks]: https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/discussions/2611\r\n\r\nAnother headling development in this release is that it contains a rewrite of\r\nits regex engine. You generally shouldn't notice any changes, except for some\r\nsearches may get faster. You can read more about the [regex engine rewrite on\r\nmy blog][regex-internals]. Please [report your performance improvements or\r\nregressions that you notice][report-perf].\r\n\r\n[report-perf]: https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/discussions/2652\r\n\r\nFinally, ripgrep switched the library it uses for argument parsing. Users\r\nshould not notice a difference in most cases (error messages have changed\r\nsomewhat), but flag overrides should generally be more consistent. For example,\r\nthings like `--no-ignore --ignore-vcs` work as one would expect (disables all\r\nfiltering related to ignore rules except for rules found in version control\r\nsystems such as `git`).\r\n\r\n[regex-internals]: https://blog.burntsushi.net/regex-internals/\r\n\r\n**BREAKING CHANGES**:\r\n\r\n* `rg -C1 -A2` used to be equivalent to `rg -A2`, but now it is equivalent to\r\n  `rg -B1 -A2`. That is, `-A` and `-B` no longer completely override `-C`.\r\n  Instead, they only partially override `-C`.\r\n\r\nBuild process changes:\r\n\r\n* ripgrep's shell completions and man page are now created by running ripgrep\r\nwith a new `--generate` flag. For example, `rg --generate man` will write a\r\nman page in `roff` format on stdout. The release archives have not changed.\r\n* The optional build dependency on `asciidoc` or `asciidoctor` has been\r\ndropped. Previously, it was used to produce ripgrep's man page. ripgrep now\r\nowns this process itself by writing `roff` directly.\r\n\r\nPerformance improvements:\r\n\r\n* [PERF #1746](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/1746):\r\n  Make some cases with inner literals faster.\r\n* [PERF #1760](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/1760):\r\n  Make most searches with `\\b` look-arounds (among others) much faster.\r\n* [PERF #2591](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/pull/2591):\r\n  Parallel directory traversal now uses work stealing for faster
