I have installed msysgit, which is the most common git command line client on windows.  It provides a pretty standard bash shell, where I can access the usual bash/unixy commands and run shell scripts.  As a former unix/linux based developer converting to .net I find that is a tremendous productivity benefit. I live in bash, even when I'm on windows. \r\n\r\nI was really excited when I found ripgrep.  As a unix junkie, I find it really hits the sweet spot.  It even works on windows on the command line. Yeah!  Bash? No problem, it rips through the source code in no time. When ripgrep finds something interesting, I usually want to open the file to edit or take a closer look.  But, bash uses forward slashes, whereas dos/windows uses backslash as the directory separator character.  In bash the backslash is the escape character, and requires special handling.  '\\t' is the tab character.  So now I need to copy and paste the direcory/filename and manually replace the backslashes with slashes before I can open the file in vim or whatever. \r\n\r\nCutting and pasting a standard windows directory name into a bash shell simply does not work as you would hope.  Is that a missing feature of bash? I could argue that with the bash/unix maintainers, but I doubt I would make much headway in that discussion. \r\n\r\nI would really appreciate a '-XUseUnixDirsep' option or something similar to force ripgrep to ouput src/test/apptest.cs instead of src\\test\\apptest.cs.

However, one sometimes would want to interop with windows port of unix tools and get slash-separated paths.\r\n\r\nWhen using ripgrep, one can override the path separator with the `--path-separator` option. I think it would be great to support it in fd as well.\r\n\r\nThis should also allow working around issues like #153.\r\n\r\n\r\nreference: the ripgrep discussion

helpful. It should output readable umlauts and it should print paths with UNIX-like slashes instead of problematic backslashes, including support for drives like \"/c/path\" for \"C:\\path\".\r\nI did not test with paths containing spaces or umlauts, which - at least for spaces - might have to be treated differently depending on the environment

as https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/269 and https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/275 points out, the experience of using rg on cygwin is not great.\r\n\r\nI propose adding the `--cygwin-path` flag to rg. When enabled, paths in command line will be translated to windows paths using the `cygpath` command.\r\nFor example, `rg --cygwin-path xxx /usr /cygdrive/z` will be translated to something like `rg xxx C:/cygwin/usr Z:/`.\r\nHere is a proof of concept implementation: https://github.com/account-login/ripgrep/commit/9686e721762d9b9b94b783ade7084c8729123f74\r\n\r\nThis flag, combined with the `--path-separator=/` flag, can improve the usability on cygwin platform.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/1905/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/1905/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"not_planned"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"actor":{"login":"EJammy","id":27494262,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3NDk0MjYy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/27494262?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/EJammy","html_url":"https://github.com/EJammy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EJammy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EJammy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EJammy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EJammy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EJammy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EJammy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EJammy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EJammy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EJammy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-07-19T02:23:12Z","updated_at":"2023-07-19T02:23:12Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/2562","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/2562/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/2562/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/2562/events","html_url":"https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/pull/2562","id":1811014157,"node_id":"PR_kwDOAzJbyc5V17G0","number":2562,"title":"windows:
