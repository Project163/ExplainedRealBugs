In particular, it makes sure that ripgrep surfaces the error message. This particular test checks for a specific string emitted by gzip, namely, `not in gzip format`. For example, from the root of this repo:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ gzip -d -c tests/hay.rs\r\ngzip: tests/hay.rs: not in gzip format\r\n$ gzip --version\r\ngzip 1.9\r\nCopyright (C) 2017 Free Software Foundation, Inc.\r\nCopyright (C) 1993 Jean-loup Gailly.\r\nThis is free software.

I don't know much about Alpine, but if it's using a different version of gzip, then my guess is that the test is too constrained in its expectations. We should probably modify it so that it checks that stderr is non-empty.","author_association":"OWNER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/comments/385682722/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"BurntSushi","id":456674,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NjY3NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/456674?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi","html_url":"https://github.com/BurntSushi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":1603442367,"node_id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDE2MDM0NDIzNjc=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/events/1603442367","actor":{"login":"BurntSushi","id":456674,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NjY3NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/456674?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi","html_url":"https://github.com/BurntSushi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-05-01T14:23:13Z","label":{"name":"bug","color":"fc2929"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/comments/385684341","html_url":"https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/903#issuecomment-385684341","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/903","id":385684341,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM4NTY4NDM0MQ==","user":{"login":"misery","id":50925,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwOTI1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/50925?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/misery","html_url":"https://github.com/misery","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/misery/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/misery/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/misery/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/misery/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/misery/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/misery/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/misery/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/misery/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/misery/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-05-01T14:29:26Z","updated_at":"2018-05-01T14:29:26Z","body":"Ah, ok, I understand.
