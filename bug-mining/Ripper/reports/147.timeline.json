page\r\n\r\n* I added a note to both the man page and the usage help to clarify that an explicit `PATH` overrides glob/ignore rules. This could possibly be clearer i guess — a glob/ignore rule is only overridden if the path as given on the command line contains a segment that actually matches it — but it didn't seem worth writing a whole paragraph about\r\n\r\n* I'm not sure when this became an issue, but when i regenerated the man page all of the long option names were broken — Pandoc had converted `--foo` into `–foo` (with an en dash).
