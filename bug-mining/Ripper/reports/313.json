It would be nice if `rg --help`'s `--hidden` section could clarify what ripgrep considers to be a \"hidden\" file, similar to the comment in `pathutil.rs`.\r\n\r\n#### What are the steps to reproduce the behavior?\r\n\r\n```\r\n> rg --help | rg -A 7 -e --hidden\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### What is the actual behavior?\r\n\r\n```\r\n        --hidden\r\n            Search hidden files and directories. By default, hidden files and directories\r\n            are skipped. Note that if a hidden file or a directory is whitelisted in an\r\n            ignore file, then it will be searched even if this flag isn't provided.\r\n\r\n            This flag can be disabled with --no-hidden.\r\n\r\n        --iglob <GLOB>...\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### What is the expected behavior?\r\n\r\nSomething along the lines of\r\n\r\n```\r\n        --hidden\r\n            Search hidden files and directories. By default, hidden files and directories\r\n            are skipped. Note that if a hidden file or a directory is whitelisted in an\r\n            ignore file, then it will be searched even if this flag isn't provided.\r\n\r\n            A file or directory is considered hidden if its base name starts with a dot\r\n            character ('.'). On operating systems which support a `hidden` file attribute,\r\n            like Windows, files with this attribute are also considered hidden.\r\n\r\n            This flag can be disabled with --no-hidden.\r\n```\r\n\r\nMy initial attempts at searching through the ripgrep documentation to understand why it was skipping `.directories` by default involved `rg --help | rg -e dot`, which pointed me to the `--no-ignore-dot` flag (which sounds promising but isn't actually relevant to ignoring dotfiles generally). If that feels like a mistake that other users might reasonably be expected to make, it might be worth additionally updating the `--no-ignore-dot` help section with a pointer along the lines of `This does **not** affect whether ripgrep will ignore files and directories whose name begins with a dot. For that, see --hidden and --no-hidden.`\r\n\r\nI also noticed that the `--no-hidden` flag the `--hidden` section mentions doesn't have a top-level help entry; not sure if that's intentional.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"BurntSushi","id":456674,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NjY3NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/456674?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi","html_url":"https://github.com/BurntSushi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/1847/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/1847/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
