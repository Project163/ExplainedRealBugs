If I do the following with good old `grep`:\r\n\r\n`grep -Po \"\\/get\\/v\\/\\d*\" fgi.txt`\r\n\r\nI get the following result:\r\n\r\n```\r\n/get/v/19670\r\n/get/v/19637\r\n/get/v/19632\r\n/get/v/19600\r\n/get/v/19598\r\n/get/v/19574\r\n/get/v/19523\r\n/get/v/19521\r\n/get/v/19463\r\n/get/v/19457\r\n/get/v/19433\r\n/get/v/19425\r\n/get/v/19392\r\n/get/v/19390\r\n/get/v/19363\r\n/get/v/19358\r\n/get/v/19337\r\n/get/v/19317\r\n/get/v/19295\r\n/get/v/19278\r\n/get/v/19243\r\n/get/v/19241\r\n/get/v/19208\r\n/get/v/19186\r\n/get/v/19128\r\n/get/v/19126\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut if I try to achive the same result with rg:\r\n\r\n`rg -o \"/get/v/\\d*\" fgi.txt -N`\r\n\r\n```\r\n/get/v/19670\r\n/get/v/19670\r\n/get/v/19670\r\n/get/v/19670\r\n/get/v/19670\r\n/get/v/19670\r\n/get/v/19670\r\n/get/v/19670\r\n/get/v/19670\r\n/get/v/19670\r\n/get/v/19670\r\n/get/v/19670\r\n/get/v/19670\r\n/get/v/19670\r\n/get/v/19670\r\n/get/v/19670\r\n/get/v/19670\r\n/get/v/19670\r\n/get/v/19670\r\n/get/v/19670\r\n/get/v/19670\r\n/get/v/19670\r\n/get/v/19670\r\n/get/v/19670\r\n/get/v/19670\r\n/get/v/19670\r\n```\r\n\r\nI think that behaviour ist really odd and cannot be intended. If I am not mistaken this also violates the documentation (manpage):\r\n\r\n```\r\n-o, --only-matching\r\n    Print only the matched (non-empty) parts of a matching line, with each such part on a separate output line.\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut it does not print all the parts. It just prints the first match N times, where N _is_ actually the correct number of matched parts. \r\n\r\nI hope this can get fixed. I may create a PR myself if it is not too complicated and someone can lead me the right direction.\r\n\r\nGreetings","closed_by":{"login":"s3rb31","id":6666298,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2NjYyOTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6666298?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/s3rb31","html_url":"https://github.com/s3rb31","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s3rb31/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s3rb31/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s3rb31/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s3rb31/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s3rb31/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s3rb31/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s3rb31/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s3rb31/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s3rb31/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/451/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/451/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
