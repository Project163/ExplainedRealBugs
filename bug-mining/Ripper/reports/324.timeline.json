bug.\n\nUsing both of these flags together produces the expected output, for example, 2 lines of context with 1 match, but still highlights other matches that were not included due to `--max-count`.\r\n\r\n_Because_ these matches are only being included because of `--context`, it's unintuitive and confusing to the user to also highlight the text for the matches that weren't actually included.\r\n\r\nRelated: https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/1380\n\n### What are the steps to reproduce the behavior?\n\nRun `rg Pro -m 1 -C 2 therapeutic.txt`, you can find this file here:\r\nhttps://github.com/5HT2C/doses-logger/blob/master/therapeutic.txt\r\n\r\nIt's also fairly easy to produce a less specific test case yourself on any type of sorted data (where you are just matching the beginning and have context enabled).\n\n### What is the actual behavior?\n\nNotice how the lines are also suffixed with `:` before the line number instead of `-`.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"794\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/assets/17222512/1c0bd437-4fe9-4193-87ac-8f2d11382f7f\">\r\n\n\n### What is the expected behavior?\n\nI feel like this would be

am proposing, wherein a user might be confused by non-highlighted matches, but I feel like that would be encountered less often than the current behavior, and in the proposed case the issue would lie in \"user has forgotten they set the `--max-context` flag\" rather than the program's behavior being inconsistent / confusing.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/2843/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/2843/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
