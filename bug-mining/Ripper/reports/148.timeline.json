#740 \r\n\r\nI ran into one issue that i didn't consider, which is that `--replace` won't work properly with this option (since it treats zero-width matches the same as any others). That's kind of a shame i think (if for no other reason than it would make the unit tests more accurate), but i suppose people can use `sed` if they really need that functionality.\r\n\r\nI made it override with `--count` since it seemed relatively safe and intuitive to me. Don't feel strongly about it though.\r\n\r\nAlso, in hind sight maybe it's not worth mentioning that it's equivalent to adding a `^` pattern, since it's just an implementation detail that isn't really useful to anyone. Let me know if you agree and i'll remove it.\r\n\r\nSome of the changes here might conflict with #728, but only slightly if so.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/741/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":1,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/741/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":1420223124,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDE0MjAyMjMxMjQ=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/events/1420223124","actor":{"login":"okdana","id":122095,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMjA5NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/122095?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/okdana","html_url":"https://github.com/okdana","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/okdana/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/okdana/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/okdana/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/okdana/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/okdana/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/okdana/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/okdana/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/okdana/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/okdana/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"f54d9efef311ee40fd32592123fd9d0c8d885cf1","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/okdana/ripgrep/commits/f54d9efef311ee40fd32592123fd9d0c8d885cf1","created_at":"2018-01-11T17:24:53Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":1420839880,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MTQyMDgzOTg4MA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/events/1420839880","actor":{"login":"BurntSushi","id":456674,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NjY3NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/456674?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi","html_url":"https://github.com/BurntSushi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-01-11T23:45:52Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":1420839938,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDE0MjA4Mzk5Mzg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/events/1420839938","actor":{"login":"BurntSushi","id":456674,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NjY3NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/456674?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi","html_url":"https://github.com/BurntSushi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"58bdc366ec292653124699940190432ae30a6732","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/commits/58bdc366ec292653124699940190432ae30a6732","created_at":"2018-01-11T23:45:55Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/comments/394545441","html_url":"https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/740#issuecomment-394545441","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/740","id":394545441,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM5NDU0NTQ0MQ==","user":{"login":"BurntSushi","id":456674,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NjY3NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/456674?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi","html_url":"https://github.com/BurntSushi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/following{/other_user}","gi
