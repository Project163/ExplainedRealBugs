Apparently, it works slightly differently. As you noticed, it enables one to replace *each* match if they want to. At the same time, it's pretty easy to replace the entire line as well. All you need to do is make the regex match the full line. So `\\bstd::\\w+` would be written as `^.*\\bstd::\\w+.*$`. To use `--replace`, you'd then want to create a capturing group as well. So, ripgrep's version of your `ack` command is:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ rg '^.*(\\bstd::\\w+).*$' --replace '$1' --no-filename | sort | uniq -c | sort -nr\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhich has the same output. The `--no-filename` is like ack's `-h` flag.\r\n\r\n> (ripgrep's --replace can be fully emulated in Ack using $` and $' in the output pattern, but those perlisms are rather cryptic, and also pretty awkward to use on the CLI)\r\n\r\nHmm, yes, I'm actually not familiar with those perlisms.
