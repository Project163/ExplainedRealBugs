For example:\r\n\r\n* That we document a minimum Rust compiler version at all.\r\n* That we support Rust compilers older than a few months.\r\n\r\nMy policy for this has been relatively ad hoc, but fairly conservative in the context of the Rust ecosystem.  I've mostly done this out of \"good sense,\" in that it seems better for ripgrep to compile on more versions of the Rust compiler than not. However, what I'd like to know is whether it's worth doing this. For example, if ripgrep changed to \"only guaranteed to compile on the latest stable release of the Rust compiler,\" how would that impact you?\r\n\r\nWhat I'm trying to figure out here is what kind of room I have to maneuver. For example, sometime around the end of the year, Rust 2018 will be released, and ripgrep will eventually want to move to that. What I'd like to figure out is _when_ that kind of move would be acceptable, and in order to do that, I need to ask people how the minimum supported Rust version impacts them. So any kind of experience you can offer would be great!\r\n\r\ncc @svenstaro @roblourens @dstcruz @joshtriplett @infinity0 @carlwgeorge @ignatenkobrain @cuviper @sylvestre","closed_by":{"login":"BurntSushi","id":456674,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NjY3NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/456674?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi","html_url":"https://github.com/BurntSushi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/1019/reactions","total_count":5,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":3,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/1019/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
