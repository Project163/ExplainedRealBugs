(It also implements a `~/.rgrc` to complement `~/.ackrc`)\r\n\r\n```sh\r\nfunction rg() {\r\n    declare -a OUTPUT\r\n    declare -a IGNORES\r\n\r\n    for ARG in \"$@\"; do\r\n        if [[ \"$ARG\" = --ignore=* ]]; then\r\n            IGNORES+=( ${ARG#*=} )\r\n        elif [ \"$ARG\" = \"--ignore\" ]; then\r\n            take_next=1\r\n        elif [ \"$take_next\" = 1 ]; then\r\n            IGNORES+=( \"$ARG\" )\r\n            unset take_next\r\n        else\r\n            OUTPUT+=( \"$ARG\" )\r\n        fi\r\n    done\r\n\r\n    if [ ${#IGNORES[@]} -gt 0 ]; then\r\n        command rg --ignore-file <(printf '%s\\n' \"${IGNORES[@]}\") \"${OUTPUT[@]}\"\r\n    else\r\n        command rg \"${OUTPUT[@]}\"\r\n    fi\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nRegardless of your own opinions, this sort of \"being less functional than competitors in easy-to-trip-over ways\" behaviour is bad PR. If I had an SSD, I'd just have dismissed ripgrep as \"obviously not yet mature enough\" and moved on.","closed_by":{"login":"BurntSushi","id":456674,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NjY3NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/456674?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi","html_url":"https://github.com/BurntSushi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/345/reactions","total_count":3,"+1":0,"-1":2,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":1,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/345/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
