With the latest release that switch doesn't appear to be having any affect.\n\n### What are the steps to reproduce the behavior?\n\nNo output:\n\n    journalctl -n5 -f | ./rg --no-config --line-buffered  'Oct'\n\nDoes produce some output -- I assume this is because the \"block buffer\" is getting full?\n\n    journalctl -n5000 -f | ./rg --no-config --line-buffered  'Oct'\n\nWhen run with < `15.0.0` each line that is matched is output as soon as it's printed by `journalctl`.  Obviously you'll have to adjust the search to match whatever's in your logs.\n\n### What is the actual behavior?\n\nSame as \"steps to reproduce\"\n\n### What is the expected behavior?\n\nMatch lines (or inverse matches with `-v`) should be output as soon as they're output by the pipe","closed_by":{"login":"BurntSushi","id":456674,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NjY3NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/456674?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi","html_url":"https://github.com/BurntSushi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/3194/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/3194/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
