and sorry for not doing my research. I suspected ripgrep to use some library for colored terminal output and that would obviously be the better place to implement this.

The variable name is fairly specific and even if it is set, one can override it, i.e. turn on colors, on a per program basis.\r\nYou can probably close this issue, since it needs to be implemented in
