I had to partially revert the optimization for the parallel iterator, which is used by default in ripgrep. The problem is that hanging on to file handles in the parallel iterator can cause file descriptor limits to be exceeded quite easily since many directories are being traversed in parallel. I say \"partially\" revert because we are at least keeping the same child handle open while walking up the ancestor path, but unfortunately, we are still opening a handle to each ancestor in that loop.\r\n\r\nIf ripgrep is run with a single thread (`-j1`), then it will use the standard `walkdir` iterator, which still retains this optimization in full. So we should at least be able to test with that to see if this is the optimization that fixes this issue, and if so, brainstorm solutions for the parallel iterator.","author_association":"OWNER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/comments/338482300/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"BurntSushi","id":456674,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NjY3NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/456674?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi","html_url":"https://github.com/BurntSushi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/comments/339073011","html_url":"https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/633#issuecomment-339073011","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/633","id":339073011,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMzOTA3MzAxMQ==","user":{"login":"chrmarti","id":9205389,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyMDUzODk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9205389?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrmarti","html_url":"https://github.com/chrmarti","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrmarti/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrmarti/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrmarti/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrmarti/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrmarti/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrmarti/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrmarti/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrmarti/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrmarti/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":true},"created_at":"2017-10-24T17:42:34Z","updated_at":"2017-10-24T17:42:34Z","body":"Great, thanks @BurntSushi!

As an example, I tried running this in `cmd`:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ dir C:\\Users\\andrew\\work\\bugs\\ripgrep-633\\node_modules\\babel-helper-define-map\\node_modules\\babel-helper-function-name\\node_modules\\babel-template\\node_modules\\babel-traverse\\node_modules\\babel-messages\\node_modules\\babel-runtime\\node_modules\\core-js\\library\\fn\\reflect\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis told me the directory couldn't be found. I then removed the `\\reflect` suffix and ran:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ dir C:\\Users\\andrew\\work\\bugs\\ripgrep-633\\node_modules\\babel-helper-define-map\\node_modules\\babel-helper-function-name\\node_modules\\babel-template\\node_modules\\babel-traverse\\node_modules\\babel-messages\\node_modules\\babel-runtime\\node_modules\\core-js\\library\\fn\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis showed me the contents of the directory, which included a `reflect` sub-directory. I then tried cd'ing into `fn` and running `dir reflect`, but I got the same error. I then tried this:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ dir \\\\?\\C:\\Users\\andrew\\work\\bugs\\ripgrep-633\\node_modules\\babel-helper-define-map\\node_modules\\babel-helper-function-name\\node_modules\\babel-template\\node_modules\\babel-traverse\\node_modules\\babel-messages\\node_modules\\babel-runtime\\node_modules\\core-js\\library\\fn\\reflect\r\n```\r\n\r\nMy understanding is that the `\\\\?\\` prefix permits the use of long path names, and this did indeed work. To me this implies that one of the bugs here is #364. With that said, ripgrep absolutely should not panic, so that's *another* bug.\r\n\r\nI did a little more investigation in the `node_modules` directory, and it's... kind of ridiculous. ripgrep doesn't just slow down on Windows, it also slows on Linux, and for good reason. Running against `cnpm`:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ time rg --files -L -uu -j1 ./ | wc -l\r\n2175424\r\n\r\nreal    0m4.899s\r\nuser    0m1.938s\r\nsys     0m5.431s\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd now running against `npm` (specifically, the result of `npm i babel-preset-es2015`):\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ time rg --files -L -uu -j1 ./ | wc -l\r\n3128\r\n\r\nreal    0m0.019s\r\nuser    0m0.004s\r\nsys     0m0.023s\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo `cnpm` is adding over 2.1 million additional file entries. (On Windows, I get only ~1.3 million entries, likely because ripgrep doesn't descend beyond the maximum file path length.) That's a **three order of magnitude** increase. To ground you a bit, the entire Linux kernel source tree is a mere 56,919 files while the entire chromium repository is 234,000 files. Something seems very wrong in `cnpm` land, and I'm not sure ripgrep is going to be able to do much to improve the situation. (If anything, the long path name bug is probably helping matters here by preventing ripgrep from exploring the entire tree.) Note that you might want to make sure your stderr handling is decent on your end, since ripgrep is emitting lots of errors.\r\n\r\nI compared ripgrep's time to traverse the directory with parallelism enabled (because the single threaded walker has the bug you found) with the time it takes for `find` to run under cygwin on my Windows laptop. (Windows 10, 128GB SSD.) I redirected both programs to another file. `find` found more entries (seemingly because it handles long path names? but it reported a similar number as `find` does on my Linux machine). ripgrep took about 20 seconds while `find` took almost **9 minutes**. This isn't a surprise because the total output of `find` is almost a gigabyte while ripgrep's is about 25% of that. So you have hundreds of megabytes flowing through your pipe any time you try to crawl a cnpm produced `node_modules` directory with `-L/--follow` enabled. Just from eyeballing, it kind of seems like ripgrep's performance with respect to symlinks specifically is actually pretty decent. But there is just a metric shit ton of them.\r\n\r\nSo here's my summary:\r\n\r\n* ripgrep can't handle long path names. That's a problem and I don't really know how to fix it. See #364.\r\n* There is a bug in single threaded directory traversal on Windows. I haven't dug into this yet, but it should definitely get fixed.\r\n* If ripgrep is going to print hundreds of MB worth of file paths, you're probably in for a bad time.\r\n* I am by no means a Windows expert, so my intuition here could be way off. Please be on the look out for very basic mistakes on my part, and be skeptical of anything I say w.r.t. to Windows. :-)","author_association":"OWNER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/comments/362134936/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"BurntSushi","id":456674,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NjY3NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/456674?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi","html_url":"https://github.com/BurntSushi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":1452087647,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MTQ1MjA4NzY0Nw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/events/1452087647","actor":{"login":"chrmarti","id":9205389,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyMDUzODk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9205389?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrmarti","html_url":"https://github.com/chrmarti","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrmarti/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrmarti/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrmarti/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrmarti/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrmarti/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrmarti/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrmarti/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrmarti/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrmarti/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":true},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-02-01T02:07:17Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":1452087649,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDE0NTIwODc2NDk=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/events/1452087649","actor":{"login":"chrmarti","id":9205389,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyMDUzODk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9205389?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrmarti","html_url":"https://github.com/chrmarti","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrmarti/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrmarti/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrmarti/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrmarti/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrmarti/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrmarti/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrmarti/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrmarti/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrmarti/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":true},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-02-01T02:07:17Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
