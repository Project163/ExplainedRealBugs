One of the things I'm interested in is figuring out the ramifications of tracking Rust stable instead of \"Rust stable minus N\" where N is somewhat loosely determined. I know some of you already mentioned that tracking Rust stable is fine, but for example, @federicomenaquintero, if ripgrep started tracking Rust stable, how would that impact you? Would you be able to just package last version of ripgrep that worked on the version of Rust that you're using?","author_association":"OWNER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/comments/414408897/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"BurntSushi","id":456674,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NjY3NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/456674?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi","html_url":"https://github.com/BurntSushi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":1798331558,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MTc5ODMzMTU1OA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/events/1798331558","actor":{"login":"federicomenaquintero","id":7617,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc2MTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7617?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/federicomenaquintero","html_url":"https://github.com/federicomenaquintero","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/federicomenaquintero/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/federicomenaquintero/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/federicomenaquintero/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/federicomenaquintero/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/federicomenaquintero/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/federicomenaquintero/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/federicomenaquintero/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/federicomenaquintero/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/federicomenaquintero/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-08-20T18:03:26Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":1798331559,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDE3OTgzMzE1NTk=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/events/1798331559","actor":{"login":"federicomenaquintero","id":7617,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc2MTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7617?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/federicomenaquintero","html_url":"https://github.com/federicomenaquintero","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/federicomenaquintero/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/federicomenaquintero/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/federicomenaquintero/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/federicomenaquintero/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/federicomenaquintero/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/federicomenaquintero/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/federicomenaquintero/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/federicomenaquintero/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/federicomenaquintero/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-08-20T18:03:26Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/comments/414460711","html_url":"https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/1019#issuecomment-414460711","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/1019","id":414460711,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQxNDQ2MDcxMQ==","user":{"login":"joshtriplett","id":162737,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MjczNw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/162737?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshtriplett","html_url":"https://github.com/joshtriplett","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshtriplett/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshtriplett/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshtriplett/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshtriplett/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshtriplett/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshtriplett/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com
