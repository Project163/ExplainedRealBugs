Currently this can be done by adding a pattern to `.gitignore`, but this of course also makes the files ignored by git.\r\n\r\nIt would be nice to have a file, possibly named `.rgignore`, that lists patterns to be ignored by ripgrep but not by version control systems.\r\n\r\n#### If this is a bug, what are the steps to reproduce the behavior?\r\n\r\n```\r\ngit clone https://github.com/rust-lang/rust\r\ncd rust\r\nrg ptr::NonNull\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### If this is a bug, what is the actual behavior?\r\n\r\nThe console is flooded with the entire contents of `src/tools/rls/rls-analysis/test_data/rust-analysis/libcore-a5db6a3445116c08.json`, which is a 3 MB single-line JSON file.\r\n\r\n#### If this is a bug, what is the expected behavior?\r\n\r\nThe repository maintainers should have a way to specify that ``src/tools/rls/rls-analysis/test_data/rust-analysis/*.json` should be excluded from ripgrep results by default.\r\n\r\n</details>","closed_by":{"login":"BurntSushi","id":456674,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NjY3NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/456674?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi","html_url":"https://github.com/BurntSushi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/1284/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":1},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/1284/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
