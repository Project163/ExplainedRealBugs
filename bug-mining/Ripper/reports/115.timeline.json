#362.\r\n\r\n - The macro is not really to my taste but I wanted to see if you were happy with it first or had any ideas otherwise. I did try creating a generic function with the required trait bounds but the generic multiplication was the stopping point here for me. Also, if using a `saturating_mul` this is further pronounced since there is currently no trait in std which these are bound to. The `Saturating` trait on the [num](https://github.com/rust-num/num) also only applies for addition to.\r\n\r\n- Removed the straight-forward multiplications and replaced with saturating versions. This avoids the potential overflow. Added a test case for this also to ensure it is handled properly. Since these arguments are always some memory bound (as per the suffix) a saturating limit makes the most sense. That being said, it is very (very) unlikely for the current width
