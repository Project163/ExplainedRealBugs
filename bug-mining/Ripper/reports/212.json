What version of ripgrep are you using?\r\nI'm using the `ignore` crate, version 0.4.2, but you don't seem to have a separate repository for it.\r\n\r\n#### How did you install ripgrep?\r\nI added `ignore = \"0.4\"` to my `Cargo.toml`\r\n\r\n#### What operating system are you using ripgrep on?\r\n\r\n    ssokolow@monolith ignore_test [master] % lsb_release -a\r\n    No LSB modules are available.\r\n    Distributor ID: Ubuntu\r\n    Description:    Ubuntu 14.04.5 LTS\r\n    Release:        14.04\r\n    Codename:       trusty\r\n\r\n#### Describe your question, feature request, or bug.\r\n\r\nIterators from the `ignore` crate incorrectly identify the argument passed to them as a symlink when they return it during the first iteration.\r\n\r\nThis is actually quite the annoyance for a project I've just started, because it means I'm going to need to design some kind of minimally ugly hack to do a second syscall to get the *actual* value but only on the first iteration to avoid needlessly bogging down the following iterations.\r\n\r\n#### If this is a bug, what are the steps to reproduce the behavior?\r\n\r\n    use std::fs::metadata;\r\n\r\n    extern crate ignore;\r\n    use ignore::Walk;\r\n\r\n    fn main() {\r\n        for result in Walk::new(\"./\") {\r\n            if let Ok(entry) = result {\r\n                let verification = metadata(entry.path()).unwrap().file_type().is_symlink();\r\n                println!(\"{}: {}\", entry.path_is_symlink() == verification, entry.path().display());\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\n#### If this is a bug, what is the actual behavior?\r\n\r\n    ssokolow@monolith ignore_test [master] % cargo run\r\n       Compiling ignore_test v0.1.0 (file:///home/ssokolow//src/ignore_test)\r\n        Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 4.72 secs\r\n         Running `target/debug/ignore_test`\r\n    false: ./\r\n    true: ./Cargo.lock\r\n    true: ./src\r\n    true: ./src/main.rs\r\n    true: ./target\r\n    true: ./target/debug\r\n    [output truncated for brevity as the rest is irrelevant]\r\n\r\n(Note that the first entry is `false`, indicating that the result returned by `ignore`'s `path_is_symlink` doesn't match the result returned by explicitly querying the filesystem.)\r\n\r\n#### If this is a bug, what is the expected behavior?\r\n\r\n    ssokolow@monolith ignore_test [master] % cargo run\r\n       Compiling ignore_test v0.1.0 (file:///home/ssokolow//src/ignore_test)\r\n        Finished dev
