more thoughts on this.\n1. There is an uppercase literal in the regex pattern itself. For example, `[A-Z]foo` contains an uppercase literal, and therefore the search would be case sensitive. Another example, `foo\\p{Lu}` (where `\\p{Lu}` is the set of all uppercase Unicode letters) contains no uppercase literals and therefore would be a case insensitive search.\n2. There are no literal characters at all. For example, `\\p{Lu}` contains no literals, and therefore should be a case sensitive search.\n\n(2) is actually slightly tricky to implement because the regex parser is a bit too ambitious. e.g., After parsing, there's no actual way to distinguish `\\p{Lu}` from its correspond character class as if it were manually typed by the user.\n\nThis is kind of why I hate the smart case feature and why it's not the default. In the simple case, it has nice behavior, but when your regex grows beyond literals, its behavior becomes unclear and less intuitive.\n\nIn the absence of input from others, I think I'd like to just implement rule (1) and call it a day. It would, for example, work in @ngirard's case.\n","author_association":"OWNER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/comments/260803230/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"BurntSushi","id":456674,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NjY3NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/456674?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi","html_url":"https://github.com/BurntSushi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":860252176,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50ODYwMjUyMTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/events/860252176","actor":{"login":"ngirard","id":98098,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk4MDk4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/98098?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ngirard","html_url":"https://github.com/ngirard","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ngirard/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ngirard/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ngirard/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ngirard/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ngirard/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ngirard/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ngirard/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ngirard/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ngirard/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2016-11-15T23:24:41Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":860252177,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDg2MDI1MjE3Nw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/events/860252177","actor":{"login":"ngirard","id":98098,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk4MDk4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/98098?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ngirard","html_url":"https://github.com/ngirard","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ngirard/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ngirard/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ngirard/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ngirard/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ngirard/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ngirard/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ngirard/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ngirard/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ngirard/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2016-11-15T23:24:41Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":874428165,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50ODc0NDI4MTY1","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/events/874428165","actor":{"login":"BurntSushi","id":456674,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NjY3NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/456674?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi","html_url":"https://github.com/BurntSushi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":"301a3fd71d3a923419d6d3e7604979b314121801","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/commits/301a3fd71d3a923419d6d3e7604979b314121801","created_at":"2016-11-28T22:58:32Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github
