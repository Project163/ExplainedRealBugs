so much for reporting this! It is indeed a bug in the regex engine. You can [this](https://github.com/rust-lang/regex/commit/661bf53d5b2b6dde25549aaad601ad8c59b37bfd) and [this](https://github.com/rust-lang/regex/commit/edf45e6f5fa54705298ba14f3216cfb5277c0908) for the specific changes to the regex engine to fix this. The short story is that you were tripping in a reverse suffix literal optimization that wasn't quite correct. The reason why it seemed sensitive to different regexes and inputs is because it is! :-) The reverse suffix literal optimization only runs in very specific circumstances related to the size and structure of the regex, and this particular bug is only tripped when a suffix literal (such as `000`) can result in potentially overlapping matches. In this case, both your pattern and your haystack did this.\r\n\r\nThis should now be fixed on master, since I've bumped ripgrep's regex dependency to `1.1.2`.","author_association":"OWNER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/comments/468061632/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"BurntSushi","id":456674,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NjY3NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/456674?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi","html_url":"https://github.com/BurntSushi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/comments/468070153","html_url":"https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/1203#issuecomment-468070153","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/1203","id":468070153,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ2ODA3MDE1Mw==","user":{"login":"ravron","id":5354796,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNTQ3OTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5354796?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ravron","html_url":"https://github.com/ravron","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ravron/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ravron/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ravron/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ravron/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ravron/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ravron/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ravron/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ravron/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ravron/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-02-27T23:18:19Z","updated_at":"2019-02-27T23:18:19Z","body":"No kidding.
