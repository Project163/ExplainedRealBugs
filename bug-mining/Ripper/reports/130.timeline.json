The `termcolor` implementation stuffs a mutex guard into an internal enum (I believe) only for the purpose of code reuse, but it ends up infecting the `StandardStream` type when it should only impact the `StandardStreamLock` type (which I believe should not be `Send`).\r\n\r\n> it is impossible to use termcolor to output to stdout from separate threads\r\n\r\nYou need to be careful. `termcolor` could use with more docs, but the [`Buffer` and `BufferWriter`](https://docs.rs/termcolor/0.3.2/termcolor/#example-using-bufferwriter) types are provided specifically for the purpose of efficiently writing to stdout with colors in a platform independent way. Namely, if you're writing to stdout on Windows from multiple threads and you don't use the buffer types, then you will need to be careful to lock stdout and apply color settings and reset them before releasing the lock, otherwise you'll end up with color settings from multiple threads influencing each other.","author_association":"OWNER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/comments/306063087/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"BurntSushi","id":456674,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NjY3NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/456674?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi","html_url":"https://github.com/BurntSushi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":1109221882,"node_id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDExMDkyMjE4ODI=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/events/1109221882","actor":{"login":"BurntSushi","id":456674,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NjY3NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/456674?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi","html_url":"https://github.com/BurntSushi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2017-06-04T19:56:22Z","label":{"name":"bug","color":"fc2929"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/comments/325175951","html_url":"https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/503#issuecomment-325175951","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/503","id":325175951,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMyNTE3NTk1MQ==","user":{"login":"remram44","id":426784,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyNjc4NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/426784?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/remram44","html_url":"https://github.com/remram44","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remram44/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remram44/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remram44/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remram44/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remram44/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remram44/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remram44/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remram44/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/remram44/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-08-27T04:07:18Z","updated_at":"2017-08-27T04:07:18Z","body":"I ran into this, was very surprised to see my code didn't compile on Windows although I made sure to use multiplatform dependencies.
