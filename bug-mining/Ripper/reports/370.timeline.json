replace clap with lexopt and supporting code\r\n\r\nripgrep began it's life with docopt for argument parsing. Then it moved\r\nto Clap and stayed there for a number of years. Clap has served ripgrep\r\nwell, and it probably could continue to serve ripgrep well, but I ended\r\nup deciding to move off of it.\r\n\r\nWhy?\r\n\r\nThe first time I had the thought of moving off of Clap was during the\r\n2->3->4 transition. I thought the 3.x and 4.x releases were great, but\r\nfor me, it ended up moving a little too quickly. Since the release of\r\n4.x was telegraphed around when 3.x came out, I decided to just hold off\r\nand wait to migrate to 4.x instead of doing a 3.x migration followed\r\nshortly by another 4.x migration. Of course, I just never ended up doing\r\nthe migration at all. I never got around to it and there just wasn't a\r\ncompelling reason for me to upgrade. While I never investigated it, I\r\nsaw an upgrade as a non-trivial amount of work in part because I didn't\r\nencapsulate the usage of Clap enough.\r\n\r\nThe above is just what got me started thinking about it. It wasn't\r\nenough to get me to move off of it on its own. What ended up pushing me\r\nover the edge was a combination of factors:\r\n\r\n* As mentioned above, I didn't want to run on the migration treadmill.\r\nThis has proven to not be much of an issue, but at the time of the\r\n2->3->4 releases, I didn't know how long Clap 4.x would be out before a\r\n5.x would come out.\r\n* The release of lexopt[1] caught my eye. IMO, that crate demonstrates\r\nexactly how something new can arrive on the scene and just thoroughly\r\nsolve a problem minimalistically. It has the docs, the reasoning, the\r\nsimple API, the tests and good judgment. It gets all the weird corner\r\ncases right that Clap also gets right (and is part of why I was\r\noriginally attracted to Clap).\r\n* I have an overall desire to reduce the size of my dependency tree. In\r\npart because a smaller dependency tree tends to correlate with better\r\ncompile times, but also in part because it reduces my reliance and trust\r\non others. It lets me be the \"master\" of ripgrep's destiny by reducing\r\nthe amount of behavior that is the result of someone else's decision\r\n(whether good or bad).\r\n* I perceived that Clap solves a more general problem than what I\r\nactually need solved. Despite the vast number of flags that ripgrep has,\r\nits requirements are actually pretty simple. We just need simple\r\nswitches and flags that support one value. No multi-value flags. No\r\nsub-commands. And probably a lot of other functionality that Clap has\r\nthat makes it so flexible for so many different use cases. (I'm being\r\nhand wavy on the last point.)\r\n\r\nWith all that said, perhaps most importantly, the future of ripgrep\r\npossibly demands a more flexible CLI argument parser. In today's world,\r\nI would really like, for example, flags like `--type` and `--type-not`\r\nto be able to accumulate their repeated values into a single sequence\r\nwhile respecting the order they appear on the CLI. For example, prior\r\nto this migration, `rg regex-automata -Tlock -ttoml` would not return\r\nresults in `Cargo.lock` in this repository because the `-Tlock` always\r\ntook priority even though `-ttoml` appeared after it. But with this\r\nmigration, `-ttoml` now correctly overrides `-Tlock`. We would like to\r\ndo similar things for `-g/--glob` and `--iglob` and potentially even\r\nnow introduce a `-G/--glob-not` flag instead of requiring users to use\r\n`!` to negate a glob. (Which I had done originally to work-around this\r\nproblem.) And some day, I'd like to add some kind of boolean matching to\r\nripgrep perhaps similar to how `git grep` does it. (Although I haven't\r\nthought too carefully on a design yet.) In order to do that, I perceive\r\nit would be difficult to implement correctly in Clap.\r\n\r\nI believe that this last point is possible to implement correctly in\r\nClap 2.x, although it is awkward to do so. I have not looked closely\r\nenough at the Clap 4.x API to know whether it's still possible there. In\r\nany case, these were enough reasons to move off of Clap and own more of\r\nthe argument parsing process myself.\r\n\r\nThis did require a few things:\r\n\r\n* I had to write my own logic for how arguments are combined into one\r\nsingle state object. Of course, I wanted this. This was part of the\r\nupside. But it's still code I didn't have to write for Clap.\r\n* I had to write my own shell completion generator.\r\n* I had to write my own `-h/--help` output generator.\r\n* I also had to write my own man page generator. Well, I had to do this\r\nwith Clap 2.x too, although my understanding is that Clap 4.x supports\r\nthis. With that said, without having tried it, my guess is that I\r\nprobably wouldn't have liked the output it generated because I\r\nultimately had to write most of the roff by hand myself to get the man\r\npage I wanted. (This also had the benefit of dropping the build\r\ndependency on asciidoc/asciidoctor.)\r\n\r\nWhile this is definitely a fair bit of extra work, it overall only cost\r\nme a couple days. IMO, that's a good trade off given that this code is\r\nunlikely to change again in any substantial way. And it should also\r\nallow for more flexible semantics going forward.\r\n\r\nFixes #884, Fixes #1648, Fixes #1701, Fixes #1814, Fixes #1966\r\n\r\n[1]:

by `brew bump`\n\n---\n\nCreated with `brew bump-formula-pr`.<details>\n  <summary>release notes</summary>\n  <pre>ripgrep 14 is a new major version release of ripgrep that has some new\r\nfeatures, performance improvements and a lot of bug fixes.\r\n\r\n> In case you haven't heard of it before, ripgrep is a line-oriented search\r\n> tool that recursively searches the current directory for a regex pattern.\r\n> By default, ripgrep will respect gitignore rules and automatically skip\r\n> hidden files/directories and binary files.\r\n\r\nThe headling feature in this release is hyperlink support. In this release,\r\nthey are an opt-in feature but may change to an opt-out feature in the future.\r\nTo enable them, try passing `--hyperlink-format default`. If you use [VS Code],\r\nthen try passing `--hyperlink-format vscode`. Please [report your experience\r\nwith hyperlinks][report-hyperlinks], positive or negative.\r\n\r\n[VS Code]: https://code.visualstudio.com/\r\n[report-hyperlinks]: https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/discussions/2611\r\n\r\nAnother headling development in this release is that it contains a rewrite of\r\nits regex engine. You generally shouldn't notice any changes, except for some\r\nsearches may get faster. You can read more about the [regex engine rewrite on\r\nmy blog][regex-internals]. Please [report your performance improvements or\r\nregressions that you notice][report-perf].\r\n\r\n[report-perf]: https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/discussions/2652\r\n\r\nFinally, ripgrep switched the library it uses for argument parsing. Users\r\nshould not notice a difference in most cases (error messages have changed\r\nsomewhat), but flag overrides should generally be more consistent. For example,\r\nthings like `--no-ignore --ignore-vcs` work as one would expect (disables all\r\nfiltering related to ignore rules except for rules found in version control\r\nsystems such as `git`).\r\n\r\n[regex-internals]: https://blog.burntsushi.net/regex-internals/\r\n\r\n**BREAKING CHANGES**:\r\n\r\n* `rg -C1 -A2` used to be equivalent to `rg -A2`, but now it is equivalent to\r\n  `rg -B1 -A2`. That is, `-A` and `-B` no longer completely override `-C`.\r\n  Instead, they only partially override `-C`.\r\n\r\nBuild process changes:\r\n\r\n* ripgrep's shell completions and man page are now created by running ripgrep\r\nwith a new `--generate` flag. For example, `rg --generate man` will write a\r\nman page in `roff` format on stdout. The release archives have not changed.\r\n* The optional build dependency on `asciidoc` or `asciidoctor` has been\r\ndropped. Previously, it was used to produce ripgrep's man page. ripgrep now\r\nowns this process itself by writing `roff` directly.\r\n\r\nPerformance improvements:\r\n\r\n* [PERF #1746](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/1746):\r\n  Make some cases with inner literals faster.\r\n* [PERF #1760](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/1760):\r\n  Make most searches with `\\b` look-arounds (among others) much faster.\r\n* [PERF #2591](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/pull/2591):\r\n  Parallel directory traversal now uses work stealing for faster searches.\r\n* [PERF #2642](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/pull/2642):\r\n  Parallel directory traversal has some contention reduced.\r\n\r\nFeature enhancements:\r\n\r\n* Added or improved file type filtering for Ada, DITA, Elixir, Fuchsia, Gentoo,\r\n  Gradle, GraphQL, Markdown, Prolog, Raku, TypeScript, USD, V\r\n* [FEATURE #665](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/665):\r\n  Add a new `--hyperlink-format` flag that turns file paths into hyperlinks.\r\n* [FEATURE #1709](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/1709):\r\n  Improve documentation of ripgrep's behavior when stdout is a tty.\r\n* [FEATURE #1737](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/1737):\r\n  Provide binaries for Apple silicon.\r\n* [FEATURE

#2409](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/pull/2409):\r\n  Added installation instructions for `winget`.\r\n* [FEATURE #2425](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/pull/2425):\r\n  Shell completions (and man page) can be created via `rg --generate`.\r\n* [FEATURE #2524](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/2524):\r\n  The `--debug` flag now indicates whether stdin or `./` is being searched.\r\n* [FEATURE #2643](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/2643):\r\n  Make `-d` a short flag for `--max-depth`.\r\n* [FEATURE #2645](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/2645):\r\n  The `--version` output will now also contain PCRE2 availability information.\r\n\r\nBug fixes:\r\n\r\n* [BUG
