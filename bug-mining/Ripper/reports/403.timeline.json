with `brew bump-formula-pr`.<details>\n  <summary>release notes</summary>\n  <pre>[Sponsorship is appreciated!](https://github.com/sponsors/BurntSushi/)\r\n\r\nThis is a minor release with a bug fix for a matching bug. In particular, a bug\r\nwas found that could cause ripgrep to ignore lines that should match. That is,\r\nfalse negatives. It is difficult to characterize the specific set of regexes\r\nin which this occurs as it requires multiple different optimization strategies\r\nto collide and produce an incorrect result. But as one reported example, in\r\nripgrep, the regex `(?i:e.x|ex)` does not match `e-x` when it should. (This\r\nbug is a result of an inner literal optimization performed in the `grep-regex`\r\ncrate and not in the `regex` crate.)\r\n\r\n> In case you haven't heard of it before, ripgrep is a line-oriented search\r\n> tool that recursively searches the current directory for a regex pattern.\r\n> By default, ripgrep will respect gitignore rules and automatically skip\r\n> hidden files/directories and binary files.\r\n\r\nBug fixes:\r\n\r\n* [BUG #2884](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/2884):\r\n  Fix bug where ripgrep could miss some matches that it should report.\r\n\r\nMiscellaneous:\r\n\r\n* [MISC #2748](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/2748):\r\n  Remove ripgrep's `simd-accel` feature because it was frequently broken.</pre>\n</details>\n\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Homebrew/homebrew-core/issues/184115/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Homebrew/homebrew-core/issues/184115/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":14248071982,"node_id":"REFE_lADOAzJbyc6BkxkXzwAAAANRQFMu","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/events/14248071982","actor":{"login":"tmeijn","id":17970041,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3OTcwMDQx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17970041?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmeijn","html_url":"https://github.com/tmeijn","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmeijn/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmeijn/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmeijn/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmeijn/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmeijn/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmeijn/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmeijn/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmeijn/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmeijn/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"3bf0b2859aa219a5b08b5969a89d569fc763a766","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tmeijn/dotfiles/commits/3bf0b2859aa219a5b08b5969a89d569fc763a766","created_at":"2024-09-13T12:19:08Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":18840958082,"node_id":"SE_lADOAzJbyc6BkxkXzwAAAARjAjSC","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/events/18840958082","actor":{"login":"Frulfump","id":11917272,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExOTE3Mjcy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11917272?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Frulfump","html_url":"https://github.com/Frulfump","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Frulfump/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Frulfump/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Frulfump/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Frulfump/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Frulfump/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Frulfump/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Frulfump/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Frulfump/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Frulfump/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2025-07-27T17:31:09Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
