That will do it. The actual problem is that `**no-vcs**` actually isn't a valid `gitignore` pattern. From `man gitignore`:\n\n```\n      Two consecutive asterisks (\"**\") in patterns matched against full\n       pathname may have special meaning:\n\n       ·   A leading \"**\" followed by a slash means match in all directories.\n           For example, \"**/foo\" matches file or directory \"foo\" anywhere, the\n           same as pattern \"foo\". \"**/foo/bar\" matches file or directory \"bar\"\n           anywhere that is directly under directory \"foo\".\n\n       ·   A trailing \"/**\" matches everything inside. For example, \"abc/**\"\n           matches all files inside directory \"abc\", relative to the location\n           of the .gitignore file, with infinite depth.\n\n       ·   A slash followed by two consecutive asterisks then a slash matches\n           zero or more directories.

(And it doesn't tell you that it did this either.) So this one pattern essentially killed your entire `.gitignore`. :-)\n\nTo clarify, the correct way to write that pattern is `**/no-vcs/**`.

(1) is absolutely the way to go. We should dump the error message from parsing the pattern to the debug output (which is only shown when `--debug` is passed). The specific place in the code where this needs to happen is in [both of these methods](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/blob/67abbf6f22019f353f44bfb04277c69a15d2d6ae/src/gitignore.rs#L262-L276). Specifically, using `try!` causes the method to stop and report the error. Instead, we should extract the error explicitly, call `debug!(\"{}\", err)` and keep on processing.\n\nI think this means that `add_str` can't ever fail, but `add_path` can still fail if it can't read the file. That's OK because sometimes the file doesn't exist. This [fact is used](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/blob/67abbf6f22019f353f44bfb04277c69a15d2d6ae/src/ignore.rs#L359-L372) to avoid building a matcher for a particular directory if the file doesn't exist.\n\nI'd be happy to mentor this change (even if you don't know Rust). Otherwise, I'm also happy to just fix it.
