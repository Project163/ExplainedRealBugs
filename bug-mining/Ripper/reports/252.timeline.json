You mentioned that you liked how `ag` handled this, but I can't get `ag` to trim long lines at all. (I'm looking at it so that I can compare its behavior.) I don't see any relevant options other than `--print-long-lines`, but it implies that its long line limit is enabled by default (which the docs claim to be 2K). But I can't get it to work, even with a very long line (>8000 bytes).\r\n\r\n... okay, looking at ag's source, I see why:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/ggreer/the_silver_searcher/blob/965f71dcbc9d98da5347f1256f650f8b7dcf4625/src/options.h#L67\r\n\r\nAh okay, looking at `print.c`, I see there is a `width` option:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/ggreer/the_silver_searcher/blob/965f71dcbc9d98da5347f1256f650f8b7dcf4625/src/print.c#L135-L137\r\n\r\nWorking backwards from that lead me to its `-W/--width` flag, which is not in its man page (where I was looking), but is in its `--help` output.\r\n\r\nAll right, so its behavior appears to be that it cuts off the line at the given number of bytes, and then prints a ` [...]` suffix.\r\n\r\nShould ripgrep do the same thing? Or should it use something more conspicuous like it does today, e.g., `[Omitted remainder of long line]` or perhaps even better, `[Omitted remainder of long line with N additional matches]`.
