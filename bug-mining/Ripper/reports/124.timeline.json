I can't really explain what you're observing though. Maybe the blend of colors makes it invisible? Maybe Powershell has a more limited color palette and can't display magenta? I don't know.\r\n\r\nYou might consider trying to experiment with the color settings, which are configurable on the command line:\r\n\r\n```\r\n        --colors <SPEC>...\r\n            This flag specifies color settings for use in the output. This flag may be provided\r\n            multiple times. Settings are applied iteratively. Colors are limited to one of eight\r\n            choices: red, blue, green, cyan, magenta, yellow, white and black. Styles are limited\r\n            to nobold, bold, nointense or intense.\r\n            \r\n            The format of the flag is {type}:{attribute}:{value}. {type} should be one of path,\r\n            line or match. {attribute} can be fg, bg or style. {value} is either a color (for fg\r\n            and bg) or a text style. A special format, {type}:none, will clear all color settings\r\n            for {type}.\r\n            \r\n            For example, the following command will change the match color to magenta and the\r\n            background color for line numbers to yellow:\r\n            \r\n            rg --colors 'match:fg:magenta' --colors 'line:bg:yellow' foo.\r\n```\r\n\r\n> and is it possible to make this algorithm a bit smarter?\r\n\r\nI would rather have a single set of defaults with no smarts. If those don't work for whatever reason, then I'd like to encourage users to set their own colors with the `--colors` flag.","author_association":"OWNER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/comments/274890542/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"BurntSushi","id":456674,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NjY3NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/456674?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi","html_url":"https://github.com/BurntSushi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/comments/274899939","html_url":"https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/342#issuecomment-274899939","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/342","id":274899939,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI3NDg5OTkzOQ==","user":{"login":"nzbart","id":1592130,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1OTIxMzA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1592130?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzbart","html_url":"https://github.com/nzbart","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzbart/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzbart/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzbart/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzbart/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzbart/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzbart/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzbart/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzbart/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nzbart/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-01-24T18:55:25Z","updated_at":"2017-01-24T18:55:25Z","body":"I'm
