PR fixes both #196 and #553. The commit messages have most of the details (including some goodies like a 2x decrease in release build time), but the TL;DR is that ripgrep now recognizes a `RIPGREP_CONFIG_PATH` environment variable. When set and non-empty, ripgrep will read shell arguments from it (one per line) and prepend them to whatever explicit CLI arguments have been given. A new flag, `--no-config`, prevents any sort of configuration from being loaded from a file.\r\n\r\nThis does not add any support for auto-loading config files from pre-determined locations like one's `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME` directory. [It was decided](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/196#issuecomment-362850321) to punt on that for now, and one wonders how far we can get with just the env var approach!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/772/reactions","total_count":6,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":5,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/772/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/comments/364997152","html_url":"https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/789#issuecomment-364997152","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/789","id":364997152,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM2NDk5NzE1Mg==","user":{"login":"okdana","id":122095,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMjA5NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/122095?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/okdana","html_url":"https://github.com/okdana","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/okdana/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/okdana/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/okdana/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/okdana/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/okdana/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/okdana/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/okdana/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/okdana/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/okdana/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-02-12T17:25:39Z","updated_at":"2018-02-12T17:25:39Z","body":"FYI, the official Homebrew version of `rg` has this problem too, presumably because they build from the source tarball.
