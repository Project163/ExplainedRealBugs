An expression \"[...]\" where the first character after the leading '[' is not an '!' matches a single character, namely any of the characters enclosed by the brackets.... One can remove the special meaning of '?', '\\*' and '[' by preceding them by a backslash, or, in case this is part of a shell command line, enclosing them in quotes.\r\n\r\nFrom [`fnmatch(3)`](http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/fnmatch.3.html):\r\n\r\n>RETURN VALUE Zero if string matches pattern, FNM_NOMATCH if there is no match or another nonzero value if there is an error.\r\n\r\nI made a simple C program to call `fnmatch()` with the pattern `[` and see what it returns — it gives `2`, which is one of those other non-zero error values (`FNM_NOMATCH` is equal to `1`).\r\n\r\nAnd here is how git itself handles the `gitignore` pattern `[`:\r\n\r\n```\r\nheartswap:/tmp % mkdir repo && cd repo\r\nheartswap:repo % git init\r\nInitialized empty Git repository in /private/tmp/repo/.git/\r\nheartswap:repo % touch '['\r\n\r\n# Without .gitignore\r\nheartswap:repo % git status -s\r\n??

Personally i think the feedback is kind of nice.\r\n\r\nIn any case, you can fix the problem by escaping the pattern like this: `\\[`\r\n\r\nNote that `]` is NOT an invalid pattern — it is treated literally by `fnmatch()`, git, and `rg`.","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/comments/310594523/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":1,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"okdana","id":122095,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMjA5NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/122095?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/okdana","html_url":"https://github.com/okdana","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/okdana/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/okdana/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/okdana/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/okdana/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/okdana/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/okdana/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/okdana/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/okdana/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/okdana/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/comments/310642862","html_url":"https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/526#issuecomment-310642862","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/526","id":310642862,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMxMDY0Mjg2Mg==","user":{"login":"BurntSushi","id":456674,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NjY3NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/456674?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi","html_url":"https://github.com/BurntSushi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-06-23T11:32:24Z","updated_at":"2017-06-23T11:32:24Z","body":"@okdana's analysis is almost correct (thank you!).

suppose you could do something like have it check to see if the character following `\\` is a meta-character, and, if not, normalise it to `/` on Windows like it does now. That way, if you passed `-g 'path\\to\\file.ext'` it would match as expected.\r\n\r\nMost glob meta-characters are illegal in Windows file paths anyway, so there would probably never be a situation where you were trying to match a file name containing a literal `*` or whatever. I don't think brackets are illegal, though, so in cases like this one it might get weird — if you had a file path like `dir\\subdir\\[`, you would have to do `-g 'dir\\subdir\\\\\\[`.\r\n\r\nI suspect that Windows user + glob containing sub-directory + file name containing meta-character is an exceptionally unlikely set of circumstances, so it'd probably work out *most* of the time in the real world. It does feel a little weird though — it certainly is non-standard, and it might give users the false impression that git supports this behaviour.\r\n\r\nFWIW, i looked into how other projects handle globs on Windows:\r\n\r\n* Mercurial's `hgignore` globbing, Ruby's `File.fnmatch()`, Perl's `File::FnMatch`, and PHP's `fnmatch()` all use `\\` for escaping and `/` for path separators. (The Perl package doesn't work on Windows at all since it defers to the system `fnmatch()`.)\r\n\r\n* Python's `fnmatch` module is poorly named, since its functions don't work like `fnmatch()` at all. None of them support escaping. *Some* of them normalise slashes.\r\n\r\n* PHP's `glob()` supports both `/` and `\\` on Windows. It seems to handle this by simply disabling escaping on that platform.\r\n\r\nIf i were a Windows user i think i'd just deal with the tab-completion not working — presumably it already fails to work, as it does on UNIX, in several cases: when you're doing negation (`!`), when you've given an 'absolute' path (leading `/`), or when you've got actual wild-cards in the pattern. But that's me

represents the root of the repository or search path, not the root of the file system. In that case i believe the tab-completion will fail, unless your CWD is the file-system root or you happen to have a file structure on the file-system root that mirrors your search directory.\r\n\r\n>I guess the real potential issue with changing the behavior of \\ in the -g argument is not the loss of tab completion but the failure (and maybe not for obvious reasons to a user) of paths separated with \\ in the -g option, even if typed that way by the user.\r\n\r\nYeah, i can certainly see how it would be confusing if (from the user's perspective) the glob just silently failed to work. This tool was recommended to me in the first place because i found `ag`'s glob-handling confusing and esoteric, so i obv wouldn't want that inflicted on anyone else.\r\n\r\nI suppose `rg` could print an informational warning on Windows if someone supplies a glob where `\\` precedes a non-meta-character... but then i imagine you would have to implement partial parsing in `rg` (since printing warning messages doesn't seem like `globset`'s job), and maybe some users would find it irritating and want to turn it off, so you'd need to deal with that....\r\n\r\nidk. At this point i feel like i'm getting out into the weeds over-analysing this so i'll shut up for a bit
