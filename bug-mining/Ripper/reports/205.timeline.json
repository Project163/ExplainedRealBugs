reduce reliance on state in tests\r\n\r\nThis commit improves the integration test setup by running tests inside\r\nthe system's temporary directory instead of within ripgrep's `target`\r\ndirectory. The motivation here is to attempt to reduce the effect of\r\nunanticipated state on ripgrep's integration tests, such as the presence\r\nof `.gitignore` files in ripgrep's checkout directory hierarchy\r\n(including parent directories).\r\n\r\nThis doesn't remove all possible state. For example, there's no\r\nguarantee that the system's temporary directory isn't itself within a\r\ngit repository. Moreover, there may still be other ignore rules in the\r\ndirectory tree that might impact test behavior. Fixing this seems\r\nsomewhat difficult. Conceptually, it seems like ripgrep should run each\r\ntest in its own `chroot`-like environment, but doing this in a\r\nnon-annoying and portable way (including Windows) doesn't appear to be\r\npossible.\r\n\r\nAnother approach to take here might be to teach ripgrep itself that a\r\nparticular directory should be treated as root, and therefore, never\r\nlook at anything outside that directory. This also seems complex to\r\nimplement, but tractable. Let's see how this approach works for now.\r\n\r\nFixes #448, Fixes #996\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/998/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/998/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":1758911289,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MTc1ODkxMTI4OQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/events/1758911289","actor":{"login":"BurntSushi","id":456674,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NjY3NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/456674?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi","html_url":"https://github.com/BurntSushi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-07-29T14:41:04Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":1758911298,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDE3NTg5MTEyOTg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/events/1758911298","actor":{"login":"BurntSushi","id":456674,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NjY3NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/456674?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi","html_url":"https://github.com/BurntSushi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"2913fc4cd063f4d869f54497a313aafbf5330346","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/commits/2913fc4cd063f4d869f54497a313aafbf5330346","created_at":"2018-07-29T14:41:06Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
