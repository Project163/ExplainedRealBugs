I am not experienced enough to know the cause, maybe something on the dependency tree of the `globset` crate changed. \r\n\r\nBut I did check the `glibc` version in the docker image from [`Cross.toml#L11`](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/blob/master/Cross.toml#L11), which should be [`burntsushi/cross:arm-unknown-linux-gnueabihf@sha256:e31d41b0555ad4a17197eafdd8945de3574d4789315c7f752fc519fca457c95b`](https://hub.docker.com/layers/burntsushi/cross/arm-unknown-linux-gnueabihf/images/sha256-e31d41b0555ad4a17197eafdd8945de3574d4789315c7f752fc519fca457c95b?context=explore).
