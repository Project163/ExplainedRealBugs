to use ripgrep 0.2.0 with vim, I'm using \"-n --color=never --column --no-header\" as arguments, which lets me use a grepformat string of \"%f:%l:%c:%m\" to capture output and jump to the matches.\n\nProblem is that the %c match in Vim expects a 0-based column to be output by the grep tool.  The previous grep tool I was using matched this expectation.  Lines are still expected to be 1-based.  Documentation for vim's grepformat strings are here, for reference: http://vimdoc.sourceforge.net/htmldoc/quickfix.html#errorformat\n\nI've not encountered a way to do math on the column number within vim, although it may be possible.   Wondering if you can support a syntax like \"--column=0based\", \"--column=1based\" or some other method to support 0-based columns.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/105/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/105/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":803804126,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDgwMzgwNDEyNg==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/events/803804126","actor":{"login":"amsharma91","id":22474612,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNDc0NjEy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22474612?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/amsharma91","html_url":"https://github.com/amsharma91","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amsharma91/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amsharma91/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amsharma91/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amsharma91/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amsharma91/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amsharma91/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amsharma91/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amsharma91/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amsharma91/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"36075aef3016998f8ae5b7a86a71cfc45ad8aabd","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/amsharma91/ripgrep/commits/36075aef3016998f8ae5b7a86a71cfc45ad8aabd","created_at":"2016-09-27T13:28:09Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":803812560,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDgwMzgxMjU2MA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/events/803812560","actor":{"login":"amsharma91","id":22474612,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNDc0NjEy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22474612?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/amsharma91","html_url":"https://github.com/amsharma91","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amsharma91/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amsharma91/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amsharma91/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amsharma91/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amsharma91/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amsharma91/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amsharma91/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amsharma91/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amsharma91/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"1a420118a6feaa8749823ca2a9b356d338c579a6","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/amsharma91/ripgrep/commits/1a420118a6feaa8749823ca2a9b356d338c579a6","created_at":"2016-09-27T13:33:37Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
