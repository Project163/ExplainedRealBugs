By default, ripgrep will completely skip:\r\n\r\n* Hidden files and directories.\r\n* Files that are in your `.ignore`/`.gitignore` files.\r\n\r\nSo I think skipping binary files is perfectly consistent with this philosophy. Note the documentation of the `-u/--unrestricted` flag:\r\n\r\n```\r\n    -u, --unrestricted\r\n            Reduce the level of \"smart\" searching. A single -u won't respect .gitignore (etc.)\r\n            files. Two -u flags will additionally search hidden files and directories. Three -u\r\n            flags will additionally search binary files. -uu is roughly equivalent to grep -r and\r\n            -uuu is roughly equivalent to grep -a -r.\r\n```\r\n\r\nCould you elaborate a bit more on why you think binary files should be search by default?

comment](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=15433341) describes a use case for searching binary files, but not actually emitting the match. `grep` does this by printing `Binary file foo matches`.\r\n\r\nThe interesting interaction here is that ripgrep attempts to ignore binary files altogether by default. In particular, it will stop searching a file as soon as it think it's a binary file. I guess the intended effect here is to prevent a bunch of \"binary file matches\" messages from appearing when searching a large directory tree.\r\n\r\nThe linked comment suggests emitting the message only when a single `-u` is given. It feels kind of right to me, but it also couples a single `-u` flag with \"disable gitignore and show binary file names that matched.\"\r\n\r\nWhat should we do here? I guess I find the use case interesting, but I'm having difficulty coming up with a good UX for it.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/631/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/631/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"actor":{"login":"BurntSushi","id":456674,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NjY3NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/456674?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi","html_url":"https://github.com/BurntSushi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-01-05T04:22:50Z","updated_at":"2018-01-05T04:22:50Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/731","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/731/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/731/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/731/events","html_url":"https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/731","id":286161397,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWUyODYxNjEzOTc=","number":731,"title":"No
