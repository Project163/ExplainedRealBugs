I'm trying to figure out the cause of the bug you're reporting. Sometimes the cause of bugs is that the report is either flawed in some way or I've misunderstood it (i.e., \"user error\" bugs). I'm trying to rule out that possibility.\r\n\r\nI will be very clear. This is expected and correct output, because `.\\repo\\newrepo` is interpreted as a regex and not a file path:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ rg '.\\repo\\newrepo'\r\nLiteral '\\n' not allowed.\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut this is unexpected and *incorrect* output because `.\\repo\\newrepo` is seemingly interpreted as a regex when it should be interpreted as a file path:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ rg --files '.\\repo\\newrepo'\r\nLiteral '\\n' not allowed.\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, I *cannot* reproduce this problem. Given the relative simplicity of the invocation, this led me to try to rule out user error.\r\n\r\nI don't have any idea as to what's actually wrong yet. This bug doesn't make any sense to me.","author_association":"OWNER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/comments/273457494/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"BurntSushi","id":456674,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NjY3NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/456674?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi","html_url":"https://github.com/BurntSushi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":927342937,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50OTI3MzQyOTM3","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/events/927342937","actor":{"login":"n00bmind","id":7993989,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5OTM5ODk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7993989?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/n00bmind","html_url":"https://github.com/n00bmind","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/n00bmind/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/n00bmind/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/n00bmind/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/n00bmind/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/n00bmind/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/n00bmind/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/n00bmind/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/n00bmind/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/n00bmind/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2017-01-18T11:58:34Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":927342939,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDkyNzM0MjkzOQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/events/927342939","actor":{"login":"n00bmind","id":7993989,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5OTM5ODk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7993989?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/n00bmind","html_url":"https://github.com/n00bmind","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/n00bmind/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/n00bmind/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/n00bmind/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/n00bmind/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/n00bmind/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/n00bmind/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/n00bmind/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/n00bmind/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/n00bmind/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2017-01-18T11:58:34Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/comments/273459206","html_url":"https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/326#issuecomment-273459206","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/326","id":273459206,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI3MzQ1OTIwNg==","user":{"login":"BurntSushi","id":456674,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NjY3NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/456674?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi","html_url":"https://github.com/BurntSushi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-01-18T12:08:08Z","updated_at":"2017-01-18T1
