ting issue. The `-u` flags are superfluous in this case, sans the last one, which you can just replace with `-a`. The `(?-u:\\x00)` can always just be written as `\\x00` since codepoint `0` corresponds to byte `0`. The `--no-encoding` flag is also a red herring here, since all that does is disable the _use_ of an `--encoding` flag, e.g., by resetting it back to `auto`.\r\n\r\nThe reason why this is happening is because ripgrep is indeed detecting the BOM and transcoding your UTF-16 to UTF-8, which gets rid of all NUL bytes in this case. ripgrep does not expose any options to override this behavior. Even if you set `-E utf8`, the BOM still takes precedence because [ripgrep enables this option](https://docs.rs/encoding_rs_io/0.1.4/encoding_rs_io/struct.DecodeReaderBytesBuilder.html#method.bom_override). This option is enabled because the BOM is a super strong indicator of the encoding of the text file, so even if you specify UTF-8, it's still good behavior to switch to UTF-16 automatically when necessary.\r\n\r\nI suspect the way to fix this is to allow one to specify `-E none` such that ripgrep never does any transcoding at all.\r\n\r\nThe only work-around available to you at the moment, as far as I know, is stripping the BOM:\r\n\r\n```\r\n[andrew@Cheetah rg1207]$ xxd foo.utf16le\r\n00000000: 7400 6500 7300 7400 0a00                 t.e.s.t...\r\n[andrew@Cheetah rg1207]$ rg '\\x00' foo.utf16le -a\r\n1:test\r\n2:\r\n```","author_association":"OWNER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/comments/468442248/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"BurntSushi","id":456674,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NjY3NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/456674?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi","html_url":"https://github.com/BurntSushi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":2172339894,"node_id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDIxNzIzMzk4OTQ=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/events/2172339894","actor":{"login":"BurntSushi","id":456674,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NjY3NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/456674?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi","html_url":"https://github.com/BurntSushi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-02-28T21:18:56Z","label":{"name":"enhancement","color":"84b6eb"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/comments/468449954","html_url":"https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/1207#issuecomment-468449954","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/1207","id":468449954,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ2ODQ0OTk1NA==","user":{"login":"LesnyRumcajs","id":9642092,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk2NDIwOTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9642092?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/LesnyRumcajs","html_url":"https://github.com/LesnyRumcajs","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LesnyRumcajs/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LesnyRumcajs/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LesnyRumcajs/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LesnyRumcajs/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LesnyRumcajs/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LesnyRumcajs/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LesnyRumcajs/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LesnyRumcajs/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LesnyRumcajs/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-02-28T21:42:29Z","updated_at":"2019-02-28T21:42:29Z","body":"@BurntSushi Thanks for explaining.

Ah yes, great idea! This is probably a decent first task, although there is a fair bit of plumbing. The high level idea is to add support for completely disabling transcoding support. This change will require changes to three different crates. (Such is the cost for splitting ripgrep's functionality out so that others can use it.)\r\n\r\n* [`encoding_rs_io`'s `DecodeReaderBytesBuilder`](https://docs.rs/encoding_rs_io/0.1.4/encoding_rs_io/struct.DecodeReaderBytesBuilder.html) should get a new option, probably called `bom_sniffing` that is enabled by default but can be disabled. When disabled, BOMs are always ignored, but if an encoding was given, then that encoding is still used. You'll need to add support for this new option in the implementation, and at least one test. This will need to be a separate PR since `encoding_rs_io` lives in its [own repository](https://github.com/BurntSushi/encoding_rs_io). I can cut a new release once this PR is merged. This is the most interesting part of this task; the rest is strictly plumbing.\r\n* Next, [`grep-searcher`'s `SearcherBuilder`](https://docs.rs/grep-searcher/0.1.3/grep_searcher/struct.SearcherBuilder.html) needs to provide its own `bom_sniffing` option that [forwards its value to `DecodeReaderBytesBuilder`](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/blob/f19b84fb23e94eb3a738f55d89c3a65225ac4bb3/grep-searcher/src/searcher/mod.rs#L306-L311).\r\n* You'll want to modify ripgrep core itself to make use of this new `bom_sniffing` option. One way of doing this is [modifying the function that interprets which encoding to use from the command line arguments](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/blob/f19b84fb23e94eb3a738f55d89c3a65225ac4bb3/src/args.rs#L960-L973). I'd probably do this by replacing the return type, `Result<Option<Encoding>>` with `Result<EncodingMode>`, where `EncodingMode` is a new type defined like so:\r\n\r\n```\r\n#[derive(Debug)]\r\nenum EncodingMode {\r\n    // Use an explicit encoding forcefully, but let BOM sniffing override it.\r\n    Some(Encoding),\r\n    // Use only BOM sniffing to auto-detect an encoding.\r\n    Auto,\r\n    // Use no explicit encoding and disable all BOM sniffing. This will\r\n    // always result in searching the raw bytes, regardless of their\r\n    // true encoding.\r\n    Disabled,\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou'll need to add support for a new `none` value for the `encoding` flag. This should be documented in [the encoding flag's docs](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/blob/f19b84fb23e94eb3a738f55d89c3a65225ac4bb3/src/app.rs#L983-L994) and to [zsh's auto completion list](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/blob/f19b84fb23e94eb3a738f55d89c3a65225ac4bb3/complete/_rg#L381).\r\n\r\nAt this point, you'll get some compiler errors because the callers of the `encoding` method need to be updated. Specifically, you need to change the [`SearcherBuilder` configuration](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/blob/f19b84fb23e94eb3a738f55d89c3a65225ac4bb3/src/args.rs#L759-L770) to use your new type, e.g., setting `bom_sniffing(false)` when you have `EncodingMode::Disabled`. You'll also need to update [PCRE2's use of the `encoding()` method](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/blob/f19b84fb23e94eb3a738f55d89c3a65225ac4bb3/src/args.rs#L653-L660). Right now, it disables the UTF-8 check only when an explicit encoding is specified. So you should add a new predictate function to `EncodingMode`, e.g., `has_explicit_encoding`, that can replace the use of `is_some()`. In all other cases, PCRE2 needs to keep its UTF-8 check.\r\n\r\nFinally, add a new test covering this feature to [ripgrep's integration tests for new features](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/blob/master/tests/feature.rs). If you need help with this let me know, but I think just following some of the pattern of other examples should be good.\r\n\r\nWriting all that out makes it seem like a fair bit of work, but I think it's doable!","author_association":"OWNER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/comments/468652062/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":1,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"BurntSushi","id":456674,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NjY3NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/456674?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi","html_url":"https://github.com/BurntSushi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":2173906466,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MjE3MzkwNjQ2Ng==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/events/2173906466","actor":{"login":"LesnyRumcajs","id":9642092,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk2NDIwOTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9642092?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/LesnyRumcajs","html_url":"https://github.com/LesnyRumcajs","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LesnyRumcajs/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LesnyRumcajs/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LesnyRumcajs/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LesnyRumcajs/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LesnyRumcajs/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LesnyRumcajs/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LesnyRumcajs/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LesnyRumcajs/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LesnyRumcajs/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-03-01T12:39:58Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2173906469,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDIxNzM5MDY0Njk=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/events/2173906469","actor":{"login":"LesnyRumcajs","id":9642092,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk2NDIwOTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9642092?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/LesnyRumcajs","html_url":"https://github.com/LesnyRumcajs","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LesnyRumcajs/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LesnyRumcajs/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LesnyRumcajs/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LesnyRumcajs/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LesnyRumcajs/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LesnyRumcajs/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LesnyRumcajs/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LesnyRumcajs/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LesnyRumcajs/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-03-01T12:39:58Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/comments/468736476","html_url":"https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/1207#issuecomment-468736476","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/1207","id":468736476,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ2ODczNjQ3Ng==","user":{"login":"LesnyRumcajs","id":9642092,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk2NDIwOTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9642092?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/LesnyRumcajs","html_url":"https://github.com/LesnyRumcajs","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LesnyRumcajs/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LesnyRumcajs/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LesnyRumcajs/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LesnyRumcajs/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LesnyRumcajs/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LesnyRumcajs/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LesnyRumcajs/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LesnyRumcajs/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LesnyRumcajs/rec

/var/lib/dpkg/status\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### What operating system are you using ripgrep on?\r\n\r\n```\r\n~ → lsb_release -a\r\nNo LSB modules are available.\r\nDistributor ID: Debian\r\nDescription:    Debian GNU/Linux buster/sid\r\nRelease:        unstable\r\nCodename:       sid\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Describe your question, feature request, or bug.\r\n\r\nwith several GB of log files via STDIN (actually `xzcat` outout), `rg` as well as `rg -F` immediately exited without any output while `fgrep` found many hits until it issued the warning `Binary file (standard input) matches`.\r\n\r\n#### If this is a bug, what are the steps to reproduce the behavior?\r\n\r\nConsider the following example (based on [this file](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/files/3009527/aeh.txt)):\r\n\r\n```\r\n→ cat -v aeh.txt\r\na\r\nM-CM-$\r\n^@\r\na\r\n→ cat aeh.txt | fgrep a\r\nBinary file (standard input) matches\r\n→ cat aeh.txt | fgrep -a a\r\na\r\na\r\n→ cat aeh.txt | rg a\r\na\r\n→ cat aeh.txt | rg -a a\r\na\r\na\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn the third example with \"rg a\", rg neither crashed nor issued a warning. fgrep in comparison issued a warning.\r\n\r\nWhile the above example might be close to what fgrep does, just without the warning, the following example is even worse:\r\n\r\n```\r\n→ cat aeh.txt | fgrep ä\r\nBinary file (standard input) matches\r\n→ echo $?\r\n0\r\n→ cat aeh.txt | fgrep ö\r\n→ echo $?\r\n1\r\n→ cat aeh.txt | rg ä\r\n→ echo $?\r\n1\r\n→ cat aeh.txt | rg ö\r\n→ echo $?\r\n1\r\n→ cat aeh.txt | rg -a ä\r\nä\r\n→ echo $?\r\n0\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo fgrep properly indicates with the exit code if there was a hit even though it didn't output anything besides the warning about binary junk.\r\n\r\nBut even though the hit would have been before the NUL byte, `rg` claims (via exit code) that there is no hit inside the STDIN despite `rg -a` says otherwise (via output and exit code).\r\n\r\n`cat aeh.txt | strace rg ä` shows that it exits rather quickly after having read the NUL byte:\r\n\r\n```\r\nread(0, \"a\\n\\303\\244\\n\\0\\na\\n\", 8192)   = 9\r\nsigaltstack({ss_sp=NULL, ss_flags=SS_DISABLE, ss_size=8192}, NULL) = 0\r\nmunmap(0x7fbfac3d0000, 8192)            = 0\r\nexit_group(1)                           = ?\r\n+++ exited with 1 +++\r\n```\r\n\r\nConstraints to trigger the issue: data must contain a NUL byte and neither of the options `-a` and `--text` must be set. On larger files (gigabytes) it is obvious that rg exits preliminarily if the NUL byte is close to the beginning solely because of how quick the command exits. We actually discovered the issue that way: Searching through syslog files which contained anything remote syslog servers sent to our server, including garbled binary junk. rg exited way too quickly and without any output at all, especially in comparison to fgrep.\r\n\r\nImpact: Does not indicate that there were hits and preliminarily exits without further notice, hence can yield wrong results (exit code as well as output) without any indication of there being an issue with binary junk.\r\n\r\nWorkaround: always use option `-a` or `--text` when contents might contain binary junk instead of relying on warnings from `rg` as fgrep does.\r\n\r\n#### If this is a bug, what is the actual behavior?\r\n\r\n```\r\n→ cat aeh.txt| rg --debug a\r\nDEBUG|grep_regex::literal|/usr/share/cargo/registry/ripgrep-0.10.0/debian/cargo_registry/grep-regex-0.1.1/src/literal.rs:58: literal prefixes detected: Literals { lits: [Complete(a)], limit_size: 250, limit_class: 10 }\r\nDEBUG|globset|/usr/share/cargo/registry/ripgrep-0.10.0/debian/cargo_registry/globset-0.4.2/src/lib.rs:429: built glob set; 0 literals, 0 basenames, 8 extensions, 0 prefixes, 0 suffixes, 0 required extensions, 0 regexes\r\nDEBUG|globset|/usr/share/cargo/registry/ripgrep-0.10.0/debian/cargo_registry/globset-0.4.2/src/lib.rs:429: built glob set; 0 literals, 1 basenames, 0 extensions, 0 prefixes, 1 suffixes, 0 required extensions, 0 regexes\r\na\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### If this is a bug, what is the expected behavior?\r\n\r\nBehaving as grep/egrep/fgrep: Informing the user about binary junk in the input instead of silently exiting as if no match was found or all matches were found despite this wasn't true.\r\n\r\n#### Notes\r\n\r\n* Yes, fgrep/grep/egrep also has its issues there like the warning being on STDOUT, not STDERR, but it's still much more clear in indicating the issue compared to `rg`.\r\n* I also tried to see if the options `-F` and `--no-encoding` make a difference in this case, but they don't.\r\n* This might be related to #1207.\r\n* I reported this initially [in Debian as #925544](https://bugs.debian.org/925544)\r\n* Via Github's \"possibly related issues\" (but when initially searching for `nul` and `null` in the list of open issues) I stumbled upon #306 which seems to declare the observed behaviour as feature named \"skipping binary files\". But this is IMHO definitely the wrong approach as you can't guess that in advance when e.g. getting gigabytes fed on STDIN just to discover that at some point there's binary junk inmidst already grepped text. So IMHO you should just behave here like grep/egrep/fgrep does and report the fact that you've found a hit in a binary file instead of silently exiting. (It might be ok-ish if you just skip such files when doing recursive greps, but e.g. not if that files was explicitly listed as parameter or data comes from STDIN.)\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/1227/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/1227/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":2257445065,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDIyNTc0NDUwNjU=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/events/2257445065","actor":{"login":"BurntSushi","id":456674,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NjY3NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/456674?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi","html_url":"https://github.com/BurntSushi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"9ec87b0a5751728dd83a34effe24157aeca929a1","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/commits/9ec87b0a5751728dd83a34effe24157aeca929a1","created_at":"2019-04-06T13:20:47Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"actor":{"login":"BurntSushi","id":456674,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NjY3NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/456674?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi","html_url":"https://github.com/BurntSushi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-04-06T13:20:53Z","updated_at":"2019-04-06T13:20:53Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/1237","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/1237/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/1237/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/1237/events","html_url":"https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/pull/1237","id":430033190,"node_id":"MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0MjY4MDM1MzIy","number":1237,"title":"searcher:
