post this issue as a follow up to #35659 \r\n\r\nIn my workspace, the latest VSCode (1.20 or 1.21 insider) takes too much cpu. Using the task manager, I can see that VSCode spawns two rg.exe processes that use around 45% cpu each, making my computer unusable.\r\n\r\nNote that these processes appear as soon as I press `ctrl + p`.\r\n\r\nI have a few symlinks in my project, maybe 4-6, don't know exactly.\r\n\r\nAs I said in #35659, adding `search.followSymlinks: false` doesn't fix the problem.\r\n\r\nUsing the TaskManager, I could see the full command line that's being used for `rg.exe`:\r\n\r\n```\r\n\"c:\\Program Files\\Microsoft VS Code Insiders\\resources\\app\\node_modules\\vscode-ripgrep\\bin\\rg.exe\" --files --hidden --case-sensitive -g !**/.git -g !**/.svn -g !**/.hg -g !**/CVS -g !**/.DS_Store -g !**/bower_components -g !**/node_modules -g !**/onmap-shared --no-ignore-parent -- .\r\n```\r\n\r\nI tried to run the exact same command from a command prompt (after cd to my project's rootdir) and it worked, took about 1 minute with no error.\r\n\r\nDuring the execution of the command, the cpu usage is very high and never goes below 85%.\r\n\r\nI am Using Windows 10 (Inisders) 64bit. A colleague of mine got the same cpu usage problem with stable Windows 10 64 bit (Fall Creators Update), so we can rule out Windows Insider version.\r\n\r\nLet me know if you need more information.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/43847/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode/issues/43847/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/comments/366845510","html_url":"https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/820#issuecomment-366845510","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/820","id":366845510,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM2Njg0NTUxMA==","user":{"login":"BurntSushi","id":456674,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NjY3NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/456674?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi","html_url":"https://github.com/BurntSushi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-02-20T01:55:45Z","updated_at":"2018-02-20T01:55:45Z","body":"@chrmarti Thanks for another great bug report! I can indeed reproduce this. Your tip about ripgrep stat'ing more files is right on the money. Basically, this is fallout from fixing #705. In particular, in order to fix #705, I had to work-around the corresponding bug in Rust's standard library, and I was apparently careless enough that I introduced an extra stat call for each file that ripgrep visits. This should be possible to fix, but I'll need to take a closer look tomorrow.\r\n\r\nAssuming I get this fixed, and after I get some of the PR backlog cleared, I can put out another release.","author_association":"OWNER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/comments/366845510/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"BurntSushi","id":456674,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NjY3NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/456674?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi","html_url":"https://github.com/BurntSushi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":1481559055,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MTQ4MTU1OTA1NQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/events/1481559055","actor":{"login":"chrmarti","id":9205389,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyMDUzODk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9205389?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrmarti","html_url":"https://github.com/chrmarti","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrmarti/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrmarti/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrmarti/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrmarti/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrmarti/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrmarti/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrmarti/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrmarti/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrmarti/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":true},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-02-20T01:55:45Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":1481559056,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDE0ODE1NTkwNTY=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/events/1481559056","actor":{"login":"chrmarti","id":9205389,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyMDUzODk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9205389?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrmarti","html_url":"https://github.com/chrmarti","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrmarti/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrmarti/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrmarti/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrmarti/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrmarti/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrmarti/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrmarti/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrmarti/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chrmarti/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":true},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-02-20T01:55:45Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/comments/366845706","html_url":"https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/820#issuecomment-366845706","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/820","id":366845706,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM2Njg0NTcwNg==","user":{"login":"BurntSushi","id":456674,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NjY3NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/456674?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi","html_url":"https://github.com/BurntSushi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-02-20T01:57:12Z","updated_at":"2
