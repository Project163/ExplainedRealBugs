split the previously singular \"CentOS/RHEL/Rocky\" section into 3\r\nsections. They each benefit from having their own steps.\r\n\r\nI've also copied steps from [EPEL Getting Started] documentation,\r\nincluding steps that don't seem to be required because it seems to be\r\nbest practice (although I do not understand it). Notably, this is not\r\nrequired for CentOS Stream:\r\n\r\n```\r\ndnf config-manager --set-enabled crb\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd this is not required for Red Hat:\r\n\r\n```\r\nsubscription-manager repos --enable codeready-builder-for-rhel-10-$(arch)-rpms\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd neither are available on Rocky Linux 10. Hence, all 3 have slightly\r\ndifferent instructions.\r\n\r\nIt has been suggested (see [here][suggest1] and [here][suggest2]) that\r\nthe installation instructions should just link to the [EPEL Getting\r\nStarted] documentation and just contain this step:\r\n\r\n```\r\nsudo dnf install ripgrep\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, this is not sufficient to actually install ripgrep from a\r\nbase installation of these Linux distributions. I tested this via the\r\n`dokken/centos-stream-10:sha-d1e294f`, `rockylinux/rockylinux:10` and\r\n`redhat/ubi10` Docker images on DockerHub.\r\n\r\nWhile this does mean ripgrep's installation instructions can become out\r\nof sync from upstream, this is *always* a risk regardless of platform.\r\nThe instructions are provided on a best effort basis and generally\r\nshould work on the latest release of said platform. If the instructions\r\nresult in unhelpful errors (like `dnf install ripgrep` does if you\r\ndon't enable EPEL), then that isn't being maximally helpful to users.\r\nI'd rather attempt to give the entire set of instructions and risk\r\nbeing out of sync.\r\n\r\nAlso, since the installation instructions include URLs with version\r\nnumbers in them, I made the section names include version numbers as\r\nwell.\r\n\r\nNote: I found using the `dokken/centos-stream-10:sha-d1e294f` Docker\r\nimage to be somewhat odd, as I could not find any official CentOS\r\nDocker images. [This][DockerHub-CentOS] is still the first hit on\r\nGoogle, but all of its tags have been deleted and the image is\r\ndeprecated. I was profoundly confused by this given that the [EPEL\r\nGetting Started] documentation *specifically* cites CentOS 10. In fact,\r\nit is citing CentOS *Stream* 10, which is something wholly distinct\r\nfrom CentOS. What an absolute **clusterfuck**. If I had just read this\r\nparagraph on Wikipedia from the beginning, I would have saved myself a\r\nlot of confusion:\r\n\r\n> In December 2020, Red Hat unilaterally terminated CentOS development in favor\r\n> of CentOS Stream 9, a distribution positioned upstream of RHEL. In March\r\n> 2021, CloudLinux (makers of CloudLinux OS) released a RHEL derivative called\r\n> AlmaLinux. Later in May 2021, one of the CentOS founders (Gregory Kurtzer)\r\n> created the competing Rocky Linux project as a successor to the original\r\n> mission of CentOS.\r\n\r\nRef #2981, Ref
