PR rounds out the initial functionality of libripgrep by pushing several pieces of somewhat CLI specific functionality into a utility library. This library, called `grep-cli`, includes things like reading process output (which also fixes #990), decompressing files, unescaping text and reading patterns from files. Throughout most operations, we retain good failure modes by giving descriptive error messages.\r\n\r\nWe also add a couple new minor flags:\r\n\r\n* `--line-buffered` and `--block-buffered` for granular control over ripgrep's buffering strategy. (GNU grep has a `--line-buffered` flag as well.)\r\n* `--pre-glob` for filtering files sent through the preprocessor specified by `--pre`. This makes it plausible to use `--pre` on large directories if it is only actually needed for a small subset of files. (Otherwise, the process overhead tends to make the search take unbearably long.)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/1038/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/1038/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":1826782231,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MTgyNjc4MjIzMQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/events/1826782231","actor":{"login":"BurntSushi","id":456674,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NjY3NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/456674?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi","html_url":"https://github.com/BurntSushi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-09-05T03:18:57Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":1826782250,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDE4MjY3ODIyNTA=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/events/1826782250","actor":{"login":"BurntSushi","id":456674,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NjY3NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/456674?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi","html_url":"https://github.com/BurntSushi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"4846d63539690047fa58ec582d94bcba16da1c09","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/commits/4846d63539690047fa58ec582d94bcba16da1c09","created_at":"2018-09-05T03:18:58Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
