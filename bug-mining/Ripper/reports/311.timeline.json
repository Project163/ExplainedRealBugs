operating system are you using ripgrep on?\r\n\r\nmacOS 10.15.7\r\nUbuntu 18.04\r\n\r\n#### Describe your bug.\r\n\r\n`rg` ignores stdin input provided via .NET 5.0 APIs (no other programs I'm aware of have this problem; e.g., `grep` works fine). Windows is _not_ affected.\r\n\r\n#### What are the steps to reproduce the behavior?\r\n\r\nPowerShell 7.1:\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\n$psi = [System.Diagnostics.ProcessStartInfo] @{\r\n  FileName = 'rg'\r\n  RedirectStandardInput = $true\r\n  Arguments = 'hi'\r\n}\r\n\r\n$ps = [System.Diagnostics.Process]::Start($psi)\r\n\r\n$ps.StandardInput.WriteLine('hi there');\r\n$ps.StandardInput.Close()\r\n\r\n$ps.WaitForExit()\r\n```\r\n\r\nC# with .NET 5.0.101 SDK:\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\nusing System;\r\nusing System.Diagnostics;\r\n\r\nnamespace demo\r\n{\r\n  static class ConsoleApp\r\n  {\r\n    static void Main(string[] args)\r\n    {\r\n      var psi = new ProcessStartInfo { FileName = \"rg\", RedirectStandardInput = true, Arguments = \"hi\" };\r\n      var ps = Process.Start(psi);\r\n\r\n      ps.StandardInput.WriteLine(\"hi there\");\r\n      ps.StandardInput.Close();\r\n\r\n      ps.WaitForExit();\r\n\r\n    }\r\n\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n#### What is the actual behavior?\r\n\r\n`rg` behaves as if no stdin input had been specified and searches through the files in the current directory subtree.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### What is the expected behavior?\r\n\r\nThe output should be `hi there`, just like when you run `echo 'hi there' | rg hi` from any **POSIX-like shell**.\r\n\r\nHowever, since PowerShell [Core] is built on .NET, **this command does _not_ work in PowerShell v7.1**","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/1758/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/1758/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":13413907070,"node_id":"REFE_lADOAzJbyc4smowTzwAAAAMfh_p-","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/events/13413907070","actor":{"login":"kyagi","id":90729,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkwNzI5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/90729?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kyagi","html_url":"https://github.com/kyagi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kyagi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kyagi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kyagi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kyagi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kyagi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kyagi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kyagi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kyagi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kyagi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"020c5453a5880257c87949030550d24c596f5c8d","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kyagi/ripgrep/commits/020c5453a5880257c87949030550d24c596f5c8d","created_at":"2024-07-07T11:30:10Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
