There was even a [commit](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/commit/58aca2efb24801b43870acac5b40c59fbc9ef350) referenced that can click on above. I'm not sure how else to explain it.\r\n\r\n> `rg -b -o --no-line-number --line-buffered --fixed-strings -m 1 \"000000\" .\\5gbunicode.txt` - This takes 20 seconds and outputs 3876278 lines, while I need only one.\r\n\r\nWhen reporting behavior that doesn't work like you expect, ***please*** include a reproduction. And please don't bump issues that are 7 years old. Please just take a moment to minimize it. Here, watch:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ cat haystack\r\nfooabcfooabc\r\nfooabcfooabc\r\n$ rg abc haystack\r\n1:fooabcfooabc\r\n2:fooabcfooabc\r\n$ rg abc haystack -m1\r\n1:fooabcfooabc\r\n$ rg abc haystack -m1 -o\r\n1:abc\r\n1:abc\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe above output should make it clear that the `-m1` flag is actually doing something. In the second example, only one line is printed, although that line does contain two matches. In the second example, two lines are printed, but only from the first matching line. Indeed, this is consistent with how the `-m/--max-count` flag is documented:\r\n\r\n```\r\n    -m NUM, --max-count=NUM\r\n        Limit the number of matching lines per file searched to NUM.\r\n\r\n        Note that 0 is a legal value but not likely to be useful. When used,\r\n        ripgrep won't search anything.\r\n```\r\n\r\nThat is, it is a limit on the number of matching lines and not the number of matches.\r\n\r\nTo me, this suggests your `5gbunicode.txt` file is one giant line.\r\n\r\n> I want to find a substring in it and get byte offset of its first occurrence. Both Grep and RipGrep can't help me with that.\r\n\r\nOf course they can. Watch:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ rg abc haystack -m1 -o | head -n1\r\nabc\r\n```\r\n\r\nBoth ripgrep and grep will stop searching after printing the first match.\r\n\r\n> Or if there would be alternative --line-buffered which will buffer relative to actual output, not to file structure. I think to buffer lines relative to output is more reasonable, since buffering is about output, not input. This way at least it will be possible to limit output by pressing Ctrl+C once you see in terminal first matches occurring.\r\n\r\nI can't make heads or tails of what you're saying here. The default behavior is to choose the buffering strategy based on where ripgrep is printing (line buffering for tty and block buffering for a file). By passing `--line-buffered`, you are forcing line buffering and disabling ripgrep's automatic heuristic. It is unclear why you're doing that here and I don't understand what you're asking for. Please [open a Discussion question](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/discussions) about this if you're still confused.","author_association":"OWNER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/comments/1870342609/reactions","total_count":3,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":2,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"BurntSushi","id":456674,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NjY3NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/456674?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi","html_url":"https://github.com/BurntSushi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}}]
