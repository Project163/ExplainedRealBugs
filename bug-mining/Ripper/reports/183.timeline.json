design choices\r\n* byte_offset is needed for O(1) access in a file (eg using seek or using a byte buffer)\r\n* line+column is needed for line oriented tools and human convenience\r\n* match_size is needed to know extent of match\r\n* match is needed for tools to do further filtering on matched pattern to allow skipping reading the corresponding file when possible\r\n* file:line:col (and this exact syntax) is a good order for the 1st 3 things to output because ripgrep already outputs in this format, and lots of tools recognize this to jump to a location (eg sublimetext)\r\n\r\n## design questions\r\n* not yet sure how to present context (both within line and across neighboring lines)\r\nA tool can just use the match and compute the context by reading the matched file at corresponding location; but maybe we can also output context as follows:\r\n\r\nfor context within line: all info is present here since we have column + match size:\r\nsrc/app.rs:1031:9:5399:9:123:here is the entire line:\r\nin format:\r\n\r\n`file:line:col:byte_offset:match_size:line_total_size:line:`\r\nwhere `line_total_size` is useful in case we want to truncate at a max line length\r\n\r\n* for context across lines we could do:\r\n\r\nsrc/app.rs:1031:9:5399:9:123:here is previous line\\n:here is the entire line\\nhere is the next line:\r\nin format:\r\n`file:line_of_context_start:byte_offset_of_context_start:byte_offset_from_context_start:match_size:line_total_size:multi_lines:`\r\n\r\n## use cases enabled by this (via external

would be nice to be able to see the indentation level of searched text line up. One way to do this would be to have fixed width line numbers in search results. This could be accomplished through an option flag and left-padding with either spaces or zeroes when the flag is active.\r\n\r\nAs this is primarily of interest for matches within a file, only the matches within a file need be considered for how wide the line numbers should be. Alternatively, one could have a pre-determined width (i.e. 6) and overflow larger line numbers.\r\n\r\nImplemented, this could look either like this:\r\n```\r\n$ rg needle --fixed-width-line-numbers\r\nhaystack.txt:\r\n 12:    needle {\r\n144:      needle {\r\n\r\nsilo.txt:\r\n  16:  } needle {\r\n 256:    } // needle 1\r\n 512:    } // needle 2\r\n1024:  } //

are preceded by line numbers followed by \":\" or \"-\" depending on whether they are actual matches or context lines. This is cool.\r\n\r\nHowever, when the output includes successive lines with different number of digits, that can slightly decrease the readability of the output, specially for files where indentation is important. For example:\r\n\r\n```\r\n1-uk:\r\n2-  active_admin:\r\n3-    dashboard: \"Панель керування\"\r\n4-    dashboard_welcome:\r\n5-      welcome: \"Ласкаво просимо до Active Admin. Це стандартна сторінка керування сайтом.\"\r\n6-      call_to_action: \"Щоб додати сюди що-небудь, зазирніть у 'app/admin/dashboard.rb'\"\r\n7-    view: \"Переглянути\"\r\n8-    edit: \"Змінити\"\r\n9-    delete: \"Видалити\"\r\n10-    delete_confirmation: \"Ви впевнені, що хочете це видалити?\"\r\n11:    new_model: \"Створити %{model}\"\r\n12-    edit_model: \"Змінити %{model}\"\r\n13-    delete_model: \"Видалити %{model}\"\r\n14-    details: \"%{model} детальніше\"\r\n15-    cancel: \"Скасувати\"\r\n16-    empty: \"Пусто\"\r\n17-    previous: \"Поперед.\"\r\n18-    next: \"Наст.\"\r\n19-    download: \"Завантаження:\"\r\n20-    has_many_new: \"Додати %{model}\"\r\n21-    has_many_delete: \"Прибрати\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe `delete` and `delete_confirmation` keys are siblings, but the indentation makes it not that clear.\r\n\r\nWould it be desirable to justify line numbers to the highest number of digits of each chunk of output?\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/2179/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/2179/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
