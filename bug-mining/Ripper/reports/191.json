Termcolor also handles Windows the most robustly out of all of the terminal coloring crates available.\r\n\r\nFor discoverability, should termcolor move to a separate repository?\r\n\r\n* Filing issues and PRs for termcolor specifically feels out-of-place in a large project like ripgrep\r\n* It's not clear whether termcolor is intended to be used by other projects when it lives as a sub-folder\r\n* It's hard to keep up with issues filed against termcolor when they're a tiny subset of ripgrep's\r\n    * ie.
