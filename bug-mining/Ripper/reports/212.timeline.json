shouldn't be too hard to fix. It looks like the bug is that [the initial path is turned into an entry using `from_link`](https://github.com/BurntSushi/walkdir/blob/4b21b55f2180bdd27d99a8999ae390a0568658da/src/lib.rs#L654), which always sets `follow_link` to `true`, which in turn implies that [`path_is_symlink` always returns `true`](https://github.com/BurntSushi/walkdir/blob/4b21b55f2180bdd27d99a8999ae390a0568658da/src/lib.rs#L982).\r\n\r\nMy guess is that I erroneously used `from_link` for the initial path because the initial path doesn't have a `DirEntry`. But this of course shouldn't always cause it to be interpreted as a symlink.\r\n\r\nInvestigating a bit more, it looks like I introduced this bug in commit https://github.com/BurntSushi/walkdir/commit/373278952ff96fd01287c6ac89f1bf4b74c6490d, which appears motivated by the notion that the path given should always be followed, even if it's a symlink, which seems fine to me.\r\n\r\nI think the question I have is why `follow_link` is used at all in the implementation of `path_is_symlink`. I'll have to noodle on that one.\r\n\r\nAnd yeah, nice serde bug.
