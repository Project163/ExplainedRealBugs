Flags listed in the man page are really about changing the default behavior. Sometimes it makes sense to phrase those flags negatively. For example, ripgrep's default behavior is to respect ignore files, but that can be turned off via `--no-ignore`, and even turned back on again with `--ignore`.  But `--ignore` is much less useful than `--no-ignore` since it's already enabled by default, so `--no-ignore` is the one that gets the spotlight.\r\n\r\nBut yeah, we can add a note about this in the overview.
