I'm glad you did before doing more work\r\non it.\r\n\r\nSo firstly, the regex-geek side of me finds this very exciting. I've always\r\nwondered what it would look like to hook ripgrep up to Hyperscan. And indeed,\r\nsome of the APIs (like the `Matcher` trait) were influenced by the knowledge\r\nthat Hyperscan does internal iteration. However, it sounds like it's still not\r\nquite fitting together correctly.\r\n\r\nOK, so I'm just going to start by responding to a few points.\r\n\r\n> Plus there is a limit to the size of the compiled expressions in ripgrep, so\r\n> using hyperscan allows to bypass that.\r\n\r\nWhile true, it can be trivially increased via `--regex-size-limit`. You'll also\r\nwant to increase `--dfa-size-limit`. Could you try that and see how ripgrep\r\nfairs? I still expect Hyperscan to easily beat Rust's regex engine on a\r\nbenchmark like this, but numbers would still be interesting!\r\n\r\n> hyperscan has a HS_FLAG_SINGLEMATCH which would be great for find_at. However\r\n> this is incompatible with the flag HS_FLAG_SOM_LEFTMOST which is required to\r\n> get the from of the Match.\r\n\r\nOh interesting. Is `HS_FLAG_SINGLEMATCH` new? I don't think Hyperscan had that\r\nthe last time I looked into it. In any case, it not working with SOM handling\r\nis unfortunate.\r\n\r\n> you can force hyperscan to stop scanning a haystack after the first match by\r\n> returning not 0 in the callback provided to hyperscan. However, this means a\r\n> call to hyperstack each time we have a match. An (outdated...) implementation\r\n> of this idea is available in the branch ideas/single_match\r\n\r\nHmm. Did this work well? It seems like this should be the right way to go..?\r\nBut I might be missing something. (I've never actually used Hyperscan in\r\nanger.)\r\n\r\n> everytime we get a new haystack sent to find_at, scan it in one go with\r\n> hyperscan, remember the matches into a VecDeque, and consume the deque at\r\n> each new call.\r\n\r\nThis is a good idea.\r\n\r\n> Ideally, it would be great if we could require ripgrep to only send once each\r\n> haystack (or the minimal amount of data), but no idea how to do that.\r\n\r\nAh yeah, that sounds annoying. Unfortunately, this is correct and intended\r\nbehavior. A `Matcher` must be re-run, depending on the output settings, to\r\ndetermine the offsets of each individual match. Otherwise, it can be quite a\r\nbit cheaper to detect _whether_ a line matches at all without finding each\r\nindividual match. In general, a `Matcher` definitely cannot and should not\r\nassume anything about the input. Certainly, checking the length is bound to be\r\nincorrect in some cases. So I think this optimization might not be possible...\r\nUnless you can some how store the matches in a way that makes them quick to\r\nlook up on subsequent calls to `find_at` without rescanning. But that seems\r\ntricky. And it would still require knowing whether the previous `find_at` call\r\ncorresponds to the same `haystack` as the one you're given.\r\n\r\nIn general, the `Matcher` trait just wasn't designed to handle this sort of\r\noptimization. I think the right path here would be to figure out a new API for\r\nthe `Matcher` trait. But this would likely make it quite a bit more complex, so\r\nI'm not sure I want to go down that path...\r\n\r\n> Do you see something else ? Is there anything to change/which is not OK ?\r\n> I'll edit the tasks accordingly.\r\n\r\nYour TODO list looks like a great start. There might be more things, e.g.,\r\nsupporting all of ripgrep's options, but nothing else is coming to mind.\r\n\r\n> where I have a 4.5k list of web domains (this is to find\r\n> possible fediverse accounts in a webpage). Using a basic\r\n> list like that is too big for the default engine, so I used:\r\n> `(some.domain1.com|some.other.domain2.net|...)/@[\\w.\\+\\-]+`.\r\n\r\nMy guess is that Hyperscan doesn't have Unicode mode enabled by default, where\r\nas Rust's regex engine does. In particular, `\\w` and `.` are Unicode aware. You\r\ncan turn those things off with `(?-u)` at the beginning of each regex. (I\r\nshould add a `--no-unicode` flag for this.) That should also decrease the size\r\nof each regex substantially, although you may still need to raise the regex and\r\nDFA size limits as described above.\r\n\r\n> code reviews : I'm using this as an excuse to learn rust, so any comment on\r\n> https://git.sr.ht/~pierrenn/grep-hyperscan is more than welcome\r\n\r\nLooks great! I'm impressed if this is your first Rust project. I don't see\r\nanything that offends me.\r\n\r\n> gauge interest : do you think integrating this in ripgrep is a good idea ?\r\n\r\nRight, so... Unfortunately, I'm not sure it's a great idea. I think it would\r\nbe very cool, but the maintenance burden this will add is substantial.\r\nHyperscan is a beast to compile (last time I tried it), and just adding tests\r\nfor it to CI (which would be an unnegotiable requirement for me maintaining\r\nit) would probably make CI times much longer. Nevermind keeping everything\r\nupdated and managing the integration. I'm afraid bundling two regex engines\r\nwith ripgrep proper is probably my limit. :-(\r\n\r\n> instructions on how to proceed if interest : is the above todo list accurate\r\n> ? what could be improved/changed/added/removed ?\r\n\r\nI would really hate to see a world that didn't combine ripgrep with Hyperscan.\r\nI think it's a great idea and I think your use case is very valid and\r\ninteresting. Unfortunately, I just can't personally justify taking it on. So I\r\nthink the only option that leaves is for someone to maintain a Hyperscan patch\r\nfor ripgrep. It _should_ be possible to arrange things such that the patch can\r\nbe cleanly applied to ripgrep going forwards, even as ripgrep evolves. I can't\r\nreally think of any other path forward here. It would be nice if there were a\r\nway to add new regex engines to ripgrep without changing its source code, but\r\nthat seems quite tricky on its own.\r\n","author_association":"OWNER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/comments/586725314/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"BurntSushi","id":456674,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NjY3NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/456674?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi","html_url":"https://github.com/BurntSushi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":3041668369,"node_id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDMwNDE2NjgzNjk=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/events/3041668369","actor":{"login":"BurntSushi","id":456674,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NjY3NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/456674?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi","html_url":"https://github.com/BurntSushi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-02-16T16:25:50Z","label":{"name":"question","color":"cc317c"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/comments/586736336","html_url":"https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/1488#issuecomment-586736336","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/1488","id":586736336,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU4NjczNjMzNg==","user":{"login":"pierreN","id":946757,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk0Njc1Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/946757?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pierreN","html_url":"https://github.com/pierreN","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pierreN/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pierreN/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pierreN/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pierreN/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pierreN/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pierreN/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pierreN/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pierreN/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pierreN/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-02-16T18:19:26Z","updated_at":"2020-02-16T18:19:26Z","body":"Thanks for the answer ! \r\n\r\n> While true, it can be trivially increased via --regex-size-limit.

There is definitely a fairly strong assumption that `patterns` is actually a sequence of regex patterns and not something else.
