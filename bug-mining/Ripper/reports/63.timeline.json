You'll get a similar error if you don't have permission to read a file or directory, for example:\n\n```\n$ echo foo > test1\n$ echo foo > test2\n$ mkdir dir\n$ echo foo > dir/test3\n$ chmod 000 test2 dir\n$ rg foo\n./test2: Permission denied (os error 13)\ntest1\n1:foo\n./dir: Permission denied (os error 13)\n```\n\nThis matches the behavior of `find` (for directories at least, `find` doesn't need to read files so it doesn't care if it can't access them):\n\n```\n$ find ./\n./\n./dir\nfind: ‘./dir’: Permission denied\n./test2\n./test1\n```\n\nTo drive this point home, GNU grep behaves similarly:\n\n```\n$ grep -r foo\ngrep: dir: Permission denied\ngrep: test2: Permission denied\ntest1:foo\n```\n\nGiven the above evidence, I think ripgrep's current behavior is probably right.\n\n> The problem that if you try to use rg with another tool that depends on the output, something like fzf it will break or you get some weird stuff.\n\nripgrep writes all such error messages to stderr. This is common in CLI applications and it is easy to suppress such output by redirecting stderr to `/dev/null`:\n\n```\n$ rg foo 2> /dev/null\ntest1\n1:foo\n```\n\nIf redirection like this is inconvenient, then you can pass the `--no-messages` flag, which does the same thing it does in grep:\n\n```\n$ rg --no-messages foo\n./test2: Permission denied (os error 13)\ntest1\n1:foo\n```\n\nAh ha! A bug! I'll push a fix shortly for that. But that `./test2` permission error shouldn't appear when `--no-messages` is set.\n","author_association":"OWNER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/comments/261799190/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"BurntSushi","id":456674,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NjY3NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/456674?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi","html_url":"https://github.com/BurntSushi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/comments/261799658","html_url":"https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/241#issuecomment-261799658","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/241","id":261799658,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2MTc5OTY1OA==","user":{"login":"ahmedelgabri","id":63876,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzODc2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/63876?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahmedelgabri","html_url":"https://github.com/ahmedelgabri","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahmedelgabri/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahmedelgabri/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahmedelgabri/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahmedelgabri/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahmedelgabri/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahmedelgabri/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahmedelgabri/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahmedelgabri/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahmedelgabri/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-11-20T19:34:57Z","updated_at":"2016-11-20T19:34:57Z","body":"I think you are right & I agree with you, because honestly I like that it reports the errors back when you have a broken symlink & since there is a way to suppress this when needed then it's ok.\n\n> Ah ha!
