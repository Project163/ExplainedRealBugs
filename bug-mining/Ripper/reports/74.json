Clap does not break backward compatibility in minor versions; it only introduces new APIs.  The README for clap does mention using ~ dependencies, but as discussed in https://github.com/kbknapp/clap-rs/issues/765 , that only applies if you need to work with even older versions of Rust than clap's backward-compatibility requirement, which means older than stable-2.  Unless ripgrep has a requirement to run on ancient versions of Rust, please consider using a \"compatible\" version instead, such as `clap = \"2.18\"`.\r\n\r\nThis change would make it much easier to package ripgrep for Linux distributions, by not requiring multiple versions of clap 2.x simultaneously.  (In a Linux distribution, the packaged version of a library will always work with the packaged versions of Rust and Cargo.)","closed_by":{"login":"BurntSushi","id":456674,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NjY3NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/456674?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi","html_url":"https://github.com/BurntSushi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/271/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/271/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
