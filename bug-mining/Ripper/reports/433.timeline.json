If I abided your request, there would now be cases where ripgrep could emit a match that isn't actually treated it as a match. I find that stranger than emitting a larger number of matches than `--max-count` specifies.\n\nThe tipping point for me here is that extra contextual lines are specifically requested. Those contextual lines could contain additional matches beyond the limit, regardless of whether ripgrep recognizes them as such. For ripgrep to _not_ recognize them as a match is, IMO, being misleading about what ripgrep actually found.\n\nI added a note about this to the docs of `-m/--max-count`.","author_association":"OWNER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/comments/3322128604/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"BurntSushi","id":456674,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NjY3NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/456674?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi","html_url":"https://github.com/BurntSushi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":19855453384,"node_id":"REFE_lADOAzJbyc6NVdv0zwAAAASfeizI","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/events/19855453384","actor":{"login":"yonas","id":110130,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMDEzMA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/110130?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yonas","html_url":"https://github.com/yonas","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yonas/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yonas/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yonas/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yonas/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yonas/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yonas/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yonas/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yonas/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yonas/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"fdea9723cac34b6e93e259c2366c94e8319de0ca","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/yonasBSD/ripgrep/commits/fdea9723cac34b6e93e259c2366c94e8319de0ca","created_at":"2025-09-23T03:01:28Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
