Well, I mean, yes, that's what a hypothetical solution would have to do. But now you've introduced a cost: extra memory use. There might be extra time cost too, for having to do the aggregate, but it could be immeasurable.\r\n\r\nOf course, that might have been feasible in 0.2.x, but 0.3.x introduced a parallel directory iterator so that actually crawling through the directories themselves is parallelized. Making that do aggregation (and importantly, knowing when an aggregation is complete) seems hard.\r\n\r\nI would say that there's basically two options here:\r\n\r\n1.
