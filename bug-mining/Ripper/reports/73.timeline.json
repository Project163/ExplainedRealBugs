OK now I got it. This solves my issue. What do you think about either adding either an example of how to search file/path names OR an alias (ala your -p flag) that would add the -g --files and the quotes around the searched term?\r\n\r\nI would be happy to try implementing the alias if that's interesting. I would suggest using the -P/--path flag as -p is already taken. My ideal would be to use the same -g flag as ag/ack or use -P for --pretty and -p for --path but seems like it would be a breaking (and therefore undesirable) change.\r\n\r\nFor updating the docs option I suggest adding an example to both `-g` and `--files`, like so:\r\n\r\n**-g**\r\n> Include or exclude files for searching that match the given glob.  This always overrides any other ignore logic.  Multiple  glob  flags  may  be used.  Globbing rules match .gitignore globs.  Precede a glob with a '!' to exclude it. Values given to -g must be quoted or your shell will expand them and result in unexpected behavior. Combine with the `--files` flag to return matched filenames (i.e., to replicate ack/ag's -g flag). For example: `rg -g \"<pattern>\" --files`.\r\n\r\n**--files**\r\n> Print each file that would be searched (but don't search).
