I am sure I'm preaching to the choir here, but I'd suggest either with by issuing warnings, or even better by [POLA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_least_astonishment) design.\r\n\r\nFollowing POLA, files and directories specified as arguments to `rg` (i.e. to be explicitly searched) should never be ignored. It's utterly confusing when that happens. So I came up [with an alternative](https://github.com/Genivia/ugrep#ignore) that both respects `.gitignore` and files and directories specified as arguments to be searched. Furthermore, I though it would be a good idea to have option `--stats` extended to show the selection criteria applied to the search results and the locations of each `.gitignore` found when applied to the results.\r\n\r\nFor example, searching the working directory that has a `.gitignore`, while also searching the `Makefile` even though it is excluded by a `.gitignore` rule, now produces predictable results:\r\n~~~\r\n$ ugrep -rl --ignore-files --stats 'c++' . Makefile\r\n...\r\nMakefile\r\n...\r\nSearched 43 files with 8 threads in 1 directory: 42 matching\r\nThe following pathname selections and restrictions were applied:\r\n--ignore-files='.gitignore'\r\n  ./.gitignore exclusions were applied to .\r\n~~~\r\nNarrowing this down to searching just the `Makefile` when option `--ignore-files` is also used produces predictable results:\r\n~~~\r\n$ ugrep -l --ignore-files --stats 'c++' Makefile\r\nMakefile\r\nSearched 1 file: 1 matching\r\nThe following pathname selections and restrictions were applied:\r\n--ignore-files='.gitignore'\r\n~~~\r\nNote that in this case it is very clear the `.gitignore` was not applied to the results. This makes sense as there is no directory to search recursively.\r\n\r\nPerhaps this approach is useful. Others have found it to be less confusing, especially when adding option `--ignore-files` to a command alias such as `alias egrep='ugrep --ignore-files'` for example.","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/comments/576407475/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"genivia-inc","id":13117347,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMTE3MzQ3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13117347?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/genivia-inc","html_url":"https://github.com/genivia-inc","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/genivia-inc/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/genivia-inc/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/genivia-inc/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/genivia-inc/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/genivia-inc/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/genivia-inc/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/genivia-inc/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/genivia-inc/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/genivia-inc/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/comments/576433421","html_url":"https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/1404#issuecomment-576433421","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/1404","id":576433421,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU3NjQzMzQyMQ==","user":{"login":"BurntSushi","id":456674,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NjY3NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/456674?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi","html_url":"https://github.com/BurntSushi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-01-20T21:20:21Z","updated_at":"2020-01-20T21:20:21Z","body":"@genivia-inc Sorry, but this is the ripgrep issue tracker, not ugrep's. ripgrep will search files that are explicitly given as arguments but would otherwise be ignored via `.gitignore`.

I just tried this, and the behavior is slightly more subtle.\r\n\r\nWith this .gitignore:\r\n```\r\nignored_dir\r\n```\r\n\r\nrunning `rg` from the root does not search files in `ignored_dir`. However, if you cd into `ignored_dir` and then search, `rg` will find things. This is likely because the directory was ignored, not the files in the directory.\r\n\r\nIf we add the glob to .gitignore:\r\n```\r\nignored_dir/**\r\n```\r\nThen `cd` into `ignored_dir` and searching there does not find anything.\r\n\r\nSo in the literal sense, `rg` already behaves as the OP wishes it to. It seems to me that a warning for the glob case would be helpful, though, especially in cases where literally every candidate file is being ignored. (I've actually run into this in real-life usage when I had forgotten I'm in `node_modules` or something of that nature.)\r\n\r\n@BurntSushi Does that seem like a reasonable idea? Would you say only in the everything-ignored case or in every case where there's an ignore on some files that were under consideration?","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/comments/739107717/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"goto-engineering","id":16588780,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NTg4Nzgw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16588780?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/goto-engineering","html_url":"https://github.com/goto-engineering","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/goto-engineering/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/goto-engineering/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/goto-engineering/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/goto-engineering/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/goto-engineering/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/goto-engineering/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/goto-engineering/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/goto-engineering/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/goto-engineering/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":4075084166,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50NDA3NTA4NDE2Ng==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/events/4075084166","actor":{"login":"BurntSushi","id":456674,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NjY3NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/456674?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi","html_url":"https://github.com/BurntSushi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-12-05T02:14:14Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":4075084168,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDQwNzUwODQxNjg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/events/4075084168","actor":{"login":"BurntSushi","id":456674,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NjY3NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/456674?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi","html_url":"https://github.com/BurntSushi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-12-05T02:14:15Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/comments/739117689","html_url":"https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/1404#issuecomment-739117689","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/1404","id":739117689,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDczOTExNzY4OQ==","user":{"login":"BurntSushi","id":456674,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NjY3NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/456674?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi","html_url":"https://github.com/BurntSushi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi
