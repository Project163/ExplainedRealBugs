In practice, ripgrep has seen very few backwards incompatible changes and no complaints about them thus far as far as I know. Instead of trying to commit to a 1.0 release, I thought it might be nice to just move the minor version over to the major version and subsequently be more flexible about bumping the major version while retaining our fairly conservative policy with regard to backwards incompatible changes.\r\n\r\nThoughts?","closed_by":{"login":"BurntSushi","id":456674,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NjY3NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/456674?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi","html_url":"https://github.com/BurntSushi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/1172/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/1172/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
