(https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/35659#issuecomment-335535129 has an example `package.json` that when installed using `cnpm i` reproduces the problem.)\r\n\r\nLooking at the trace in Process Monitor I see many files being opened for reading metadata in `DirEntryRaw:from_link` and to detect loops in same_file's `Handle::from_path`.\r\n\r\nOne area where this might be improved is where `check_symlink_loop()` loops over parent directories of each symlinked directory, causing is_same_file to open the same parent directory once for each of its symlinked subdirectories. Maybe a directory's id could be cached for the duration of its content being traversed?\r\n\r\n/cc @roblourens","closed_by":{"login":"BurntSushi","id":456674,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NjY3NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/456674?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi","html_url":"https://github.com/BurntSushi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/633/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/633/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
