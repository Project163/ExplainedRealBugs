Since they exist on my local machine I don't add them to the repo tracked .gitignore, so I configured a global gitignore but it seems to not work. https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/9 seems to create support for it, but it's quite old already so perhaps it's now broken.\r\n\r\n#### What are the steps to reproduce the behavior?\r\n\r\n```sh\r\n$ git config core.excludesFile\r\n~/.gitignore\r\n\r\n$ cat ~/.gitignore\r\n*.sql\r\n\r\n$ rg --files | rg backup\r\nbackup\r\nbackup_21_07_2022.sql\r\nbackup_11-12-22.sql\r\ndb_backup.sql\r\n\r\n$ git add db_backup.sql\r\nThe following paths are ignored by one of your .gitignore files:\r\ndb_backup.sql\r\nhint: Use -f if you really want to add them.\r\nhint: Turn this message off by running\r\nhint: \"git config advice.addIgnoredFile false\"\r\n\r\n$ echo \"*.sql\" >> .gitignore\r\n\r\n$ rg --files | rg backup\r\nbackup\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou can see that git refuses to add the file since it is ignored by the global .gitignore and then that ripgrep would only respect it if is present in the working directory.\r\n\r\n#### What is the actual behavior?\r\nPatterns from global .gitignore are ignored by ripgrep\r\n\r\n#### What is the expected behavior?\r\nPatterns from global .gitignore are respected by ripgrep\r\n\r\n#### What do you think ripgrep should have done?\r\nIgnore the patterns present in the global .gitignore","closed_by":{"login":"BurntSushi","id":456674,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NjY3NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/456674?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi","html_url":"https://github.com/BurntSushi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/2392/reactions","total_count":4,"+1":4,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/2392/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
