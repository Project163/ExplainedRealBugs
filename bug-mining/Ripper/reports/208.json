A quick count appears to put it at `80`. Right now, these flags are listed alphabetically in the man page. I'm wondering whether it would be better to group them into logical sections.\r\n\r\nFor example, when PCRE2 support is enabled with the `--pcre2`, its Unicode support is enabled by default. ripgrep provides a flag, `--no-pcre2-unicode`, to disable PCRE2's Unicode support. However, the man page lists this as `--pcre2-unicode`, and states that it is enabled by default and can be disabled by using `--no-pcre2-unicode`. I did it this way so that the flag would be \"discoverable\" next to the `--pcre2` flag. But perhaps the better thing to do here is to just group flags.\r\n\r\nI am somewhat inspired to do this based on ripgrep's zsh [completion script](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/blob/master/complete/_rg), which defines its own groups. I'm not sure we want to make the groups in the man page as granular as that, but with the number of flags ripgrep has, it seems like a decent idea.\r\n\r\n@okdana I'm especially interested to hear your opinion on this. :-)","closed_by":{"login":"BurntSushi","id":456674,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NjY3NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/456674?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi","html_url":"https://github.com/BurntSushi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/1022/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/1022/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
