I'm at the point of dealing with the threads.  The way the threads are used, Rust can't know that the threads will all join by the end of the function call, requiring a `'static` lifetime.  Using `crossbeam` for scoped-threads should make this problem go away.\r\n\r\nI wanted to check-in before going too much further.  It looks like [`scope`](https://docs.rs/crossbeam-utils/0.6.6/crossbeam_utils/thread/fn.scope.html) is in `crossbeam-utils` which is a dependency of `crossbeam-channels`, so this shouldn't add any new dependency to the full dependency
