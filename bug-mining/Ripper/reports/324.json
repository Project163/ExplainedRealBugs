This is not really a bug, more like inconsistent behavior.\r\n\r\nI am searching for the first match in one file and want to print the next _n_ lines.\r\nIf there are no additional matches in the context, then the search output stops after the first result and prints the next _n_ lines.\r\nIf there is an additional match within the next _n_ lines, then (it seems like) rg treats this as a match and restarts its internal context line counter, printing an additional _n_ lines. \r\n\r\nI am aware that --max-count is a limit on per-line matches. But it _works_ for some input files and it does not work for some other files, which is unexpected.
