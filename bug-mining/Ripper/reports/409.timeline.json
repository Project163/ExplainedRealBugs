The core of the problem here is that you've seemed to derive a generic failure from a very specific one, namely, that all ignore rules are overridden for a directory that is specified on the command line. But this is not true, as you noted with the glob rules. But your glob rules and your ignore rules are different, so you haven't accounted for the fact that there may be a bug with the specific pattern in your ignore file that doesn't impact the pattern in your `-g` glob. For example, if you change your rule in your ignore file from `/a/b` to `*.txt`, then `rg Sample` behaves the same as `rg Sample a`. The heart of the matter seems to be that `/a/b` does not match `a/b` when `a` is given as an explicit path, but it does indeed seem like it should match and therefore be ignored.\r\n\r\nNote though that if you specified `a/b` on the command line, then that path shouldn't be ignored. In particular, the documentation provided by ripgrep is exactly correct:\r\n\r\n> Paths specified expicitly on the command line override glob and ignore rules.\r\n\r\nThat is, if you give a path to ripgrep, then that path itself is immune to any other ignore rules inherited from the configuration, including those specified explicitly on the command line via the `-g` globs. But this says nothing about children of those paths. The ignore rules still apply to them because they weren't specified explicitly on the command line.","author_association":"OWNER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/comments/367659538/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"BurntSushi","id":456674,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NjY3NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/456674?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi","html_url":"https://github.com/BurntSushi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":1486780536,"node_id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDE0ODY3ODA1MzY=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/events/1486780536","actor":{"login":"BurntSushi","id":456674,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NjY3NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/456674?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi","html_url":"https://github.com/BurntSushi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-02-22T12:01:04Z","label":{"name":"bug","color":"fc2929"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/comments/367660416","html_url":"https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/829#issuecomment-367660416","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/829","id":367660416,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM2NzY2MDQxNg==","user":{"login":"BurntSushi","id":456674,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NjY3NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/456674?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi","html_url":"https://github.com/BurntSushi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-02-22T12:04:43Z","updated_at":"2018-02-22T12:04:43Z","body":"Interestingly, `a/b` also doesn't work, but `**/a/b` behaves as expected.

`Ignore`.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/962/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/962/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":1697802124,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDE2OTc4MDIxMjQ=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/events/1697802124","actor":{"login":"tmccombs","id":2541726,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1NDE3MjY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2541726?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmccombs","html_url":"https://github.com/tmccombs","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmccombs/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmccombs/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmccombs/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmccombs/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmccombs/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmccombs/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmccombs/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmccombs/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmccombs/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"44dd47cdcbbc41c7bf6c16e9ced19056bc685e24","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tmccombs/ripgrep/commits/44dd47cdcbbc41c7bf6c16e9ced19056bc685e24","created_at":"2018-06-24T23:34:35Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"actor":{"login":"tmccombs","id":2541726,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1NDE3MjY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2541726?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmccombs","html_url":"https://github.com/tmccombs","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmccombs/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmccombs/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmccombs/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmccombs/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmccombs/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmccombs/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmccombs/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmccombs/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmccombs/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-06-24T23:35:24Z","updated_at":"2018-06-24T23:35:24Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/963","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/963/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/963/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/963/events","html_url":"https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/pull/963","id":335222603,"node_id":"MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0MTk2OTc2MjIw","number":963,"title":"Fix
