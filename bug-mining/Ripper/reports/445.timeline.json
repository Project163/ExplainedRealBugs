Or at least, not in a way that results in a meaningful difference with GNU grep. Can you please provide an MRE?\n\nHere's what I tried. First, the setup:\n\n```\n$ curl -LO 'https://burntsushi.net/stuff/opensubtitles/2018/en/sixteenth.txt.gz'\n$ gzip -d sixteenth.txt.gz\n$ ls -lh\ntotal 773M\n-rw-rw-r-- 1 andrew users 773M Oct 13 16:57 sixteenth.txt\n$ (echo ZQZQZQZQZQ && for ((i=0;i<10;i++)); do cat sixteenth.txt; done) > bigger.txt\n$ time rg -c ZQZQZQZQZQ bigger.txt\n1\n\nreal    0.645\nuser    0.414\nsys     0.229\nmaxmem  7734 MB\nfaults  0\n```\n\nNow `grep` timings:\n\n```\n$ (time grep ZQZQZQZQZQ bigger.txt -A999999) | wc -l\n\nreal    0.711\nuser    0.202\nsys     0.506\nmaxmem  29 MB\nfaults  0\n1000000\n$ (time grep ZQZQZQZQZQ bigger.txt -A9999999) | wc -l\n\nreal    1.055\nuser    0.514\nsys     0.538\nmaxmem  29 MB\nfaults  0\n10000000\n$ (time grep ZQZQZQZQZQ bigger.txt -A99999999) | wc -l\n\nreal    4.543\nuser    3.691\nsys     0.845\nmaxmem  29 MB\nfaults  0\n100000000\n$ (time grep ZQZQZQZQZQ bigger.txt -A999999999) | wc -l\n\nreal    11.321\nuser    9.942\nsys     1.364\nmaxmem  29 MB\nfaults  0\n275906531\n```\n\nAnd now ripgrep timings with the same `-A` arguments:\n\n```\n$ (time rg ZQZQZQZQZQ bigger.txt -A999999) | wc -l\n\nreal    0.645\nuser    0.428\nsys     0.214\nmaxmem  7734 MB\nfaults  0\n1000000\n$ (time rg ZQZQZQZQZQ bigger.txt -A9999999) | wc -l\n\nreal    0.975\nuser    0.742\nsys     0.230\nmaxmem  7734 MB\nfaults  0\n10000000\n$ (time rg ZQZQZQZQZQ bigger.txt -A99999999) | wc -l\n\nreal    3.943\nuser    3.513\nsys     0.423\nmaxmem  7734 MB\nfaults  0\n100000000\n$ (time rg ZQZQZQZQZQ bigger.txt -A999999999) | wc -l\n\nreal    9.781\nuser    8.928\nsys     0.839\nmaxmem  7735 MB\nfaults  0\n275906531\n```\n\nThe memory usage reported is high, but that's because of memory mapping. You can disable that and get similar memory usage as GNU grep:\n\n```\n$ (time rg ZQZQZQZQZQ bigger.txt --no-mmap -A999999999) | wc -l\n\nreal    9.318\nuser    8.201\nsys     1.103\nmaxmem  29 MB\nfaults  0\n275906531\n```\n\nVersion info:\n\n```\n$ grep -V\ngrep (GNU grep) 3.12-modified\nCopyright (C) 2025 Free Software Foundation, Inc.\nLicense GPLv3+: GNU GPL version 3 or later <https://gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html>.\nThis is free software: you are free to change and redistribute it.\nThere is NO WARRANTY, to the extent permitted by law.\n\nWritten by Mike Haertel and others; see\n<https://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/grep.git/tree/AUTHORS>.\n\ngrep -P uses PCRE2 10.46 2025-08-27\n\n$ rg --version\nripgrep 14.1.1 (rev de2567a4c7)\n\nfeatures:+pcre2\nsimd(compile):+SSE2,-SSSE3,-AVX2\nsimd(runtime):+SSE2,+SSSE3,+AVX2\n\nPCRE2 10.45 is available (JIT is available)\n```\n\nI'm running the latest ripgrep built from `master`, but I tried the above commands with the ripgrep 14.1.1 release and there was no meaningful difference.\n\nThis is likely the code handling the `-A` flag:\n\nhttps://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/blob/de2567a4c76fa671005538d6cd841abc44932b9a/crates/searcher/src/searcher/core.rs#L272-L305\n\nI can't spot any obvious sub-optimal behavior here.

commit messages have the details, but:\r\n\r\n* When searching `stdin`, at least on my Linux machine, calls to `read` never seem to return more than 64K. This caused a pathological problem with large values of `-A/--after-context` that prevented ripgrep from amortizing `read` calls as well as it should.\r\n* When `-A/--after-context` is used, we don't need to find the last N lines before rolling our search buffer. We still do when `-B/--before-context` is set though. And indeed, this can cause ripgrep to be materially slower with large values of `-B` but not with `-A`. Indeed, GNU grep suffers from a similar problem (but is far far slower than ripgrep).\r\n\r\nFixes #3184","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/3185/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/3185/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/comments/3403033372","html_url":"https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/3184#issuecomment-3403033372","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/3184","id":3403033372,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAzJbyc7K1isc","user":{"login":"BurntSushi","id":456674,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NjY3NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/456674?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi","html_url":"https://github.com/BurntSushi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-10-14T18:04:20Z","updated_at":"2025-10-14T18:04:55Z","body":"This was a very subtle problem related to the apparent difference in how much the caller's buffer is filled on `read` syscalls. It's seemingly different when reading from `stdin` versus an explicit file. (Which kind of boggles my mind.) That isn't a problem in and of itself, but it caused a pathological problem in ripgrep where it ended up not amortizing `read` calls as well at it should. See https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/pull/3185/commits/8bf6f0a2a8fd4d0786561b2901f2b1443ff2d8d4 for more details.\n\nAlso, I discovered that GNU grep has a similar problem with `-B/--before-context`:\n\n```\n$ cat bigger.txt | (time grep ZQZQZQZQZQ -B9) | wc -l\n\nreal    1.568\nuser    0.170\nsys     0.885\nmaxmem  30 MB\nfaults  0\n1\n\n$ cat bigger.txt | (time grep ZQZQZQZQZQ -B99) | wc -l\n\nreal    1.734\nuser    0.338\nsys     0.879\nmaxmem  30 MB\nfaults  0\n1\n\n$ cat bigger.txt | (time grep ZQZQZQZQZQ -B999) | wc -l\n\nreal    2.349\nuser    1.723\nsys     0.620\nmaxmem  30 MB\nfaults  0\n1\n\n$ cat bigger.txt | (time grep ZQZQZQZQZQ -B9999) | wc -l\n\nreal    16.459\nuser    15.848\nsys     0.586\nmaxmem  30 MB\nfaults  0\n1\n\n$ time grep ZQZQZQZQZQ -B99999 bigger.txt | wc -l\n\nreal    1:45.06\nuser    1:44.12\nsys     0.772\nmaxmem  30 MB\nfaults  0\n1\n```\n\nThe above pattern occurs regardless of whether you put `bigger.txt` on stdin or whether you search it directly.\n\nripgrep actually does better in this case (after fixing this bug):\n\n```\n$ cat bigger.txt | (time rg ZQZQZQZQZQ -B9) | wc -l\n\nreal    1.965\nuser    0.326\nsys     0.814\nmaxmem  29 MB\nfaults  0\n1\n\n$ cat bigger.txt | (time rg ZQZQZQZQZQ -B99) | wc -l\n\nreal    1.941\nuser    0.423\nsys     0.813\nmaxmem  29 MB\nfaults  0\n1\n\n$ cat bigger.txt | (time rg ZQZQZQZQZQ -B999) | wc -l\n\nreal    2.372\nuser    0.759\nsys     0.703\nmaxmem  30 MB\nfaults  0\n1\n\n$ cat bigger.txt | (time rg ZQZQZQZQZQ -B9999) | wc -l\n\nreal    2.638\nuser    0.895\nsys     0.665\nmaxmem  29 MB\nfaults  0\n1\n\n$ cat bigger.txt | (time rg ZQZQZQZQZQ -B99999) | wc -l\n\nreal    5.172\nuser    3.282\nsys     0.748\nmaxmem  29 MB\nfaults  0\n1\n```\n\nWith #3185, ripgrep's `-A/--after-context` flag is now quite a bit faster than its `-B/--before-context` flag (GNU grep has this same difference):\n\n```\n$ cat bigger.txt | (time rg ZQZQZQZQZQ -A9999) | wc -l\n\nreal    1.828\nuser    0.319\nsys     0.744\nmaxmem  30 MB\nfaults  0\n10000\n\n$ cat bigger.txt | (time rg ZQZQZQZQZQ -A99999) | wc -l\n\nreal    1.919\nuser    0.309\nsys     0.780\nmaxmem  30 MB\nfaults  0\n100000\n\n$ cat bigger.txt | (time rg ZQZQZQZQZQ -A999999) | wc -l\n\nreal    1.879\nuser    0.331\nsys     0.759\nmaxmem  30 MB\nfaults  0\n1000000\n```\n\nThis is because with `-B`, you need to keep around N lines in your buffer as you read more data. It takes time to \"look back\" in the buffer to discover those lines. Presumably GNU grep suffers from the same problem given its search times above, but I'm actually not sure why it's so much slower than ripgrep.","author_association":"OWNER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/comments/3403033372/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":2,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"BurntSushi","id":456674,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NjY3NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/456674?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi","html_url":"https://github.com/BurntSushi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":20276721333,"node_id":"REFE_lADOAzJbyc7RTAWczwAAAAS4lja1","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/events/20276721333","actor":{"login":"BurntSushi","id":456674,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NjY3NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/456674?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi","html_url":"https://github.com/BurntSushi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"8c6595c215d1e24bed5b7b86e2b18f3c871439ef","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/commits/8c6595c215d1e24bed5b7b86e2b18f3c871439ef","created_at":"2025-10-14T18:27:44Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":20276721351,"node_id":"CE_lADOAzJbyc7RTAWczwAAAAS4ljbH","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/events/20276721351","actor":{"login":"BurntSushi","id":456674,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NjY3NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/456674?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi","html_url":"https://github.com/BurntSushi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2025-10-14T18:27:44Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/comments/3403236968","html_url":"https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/3184#issuecomment-3403236968","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/3184","id":3403236968,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAzJbyc7K2UZo","user":{"login":"d-e-s-o","id":6610056,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2MTAwNTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6610056?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/d-e-s-o","html_url":"https://github.com/d-e-s-o","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/d-e-s-o/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/d-e-s-o/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/d-e-s-o/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/d-e-s-o/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/d-e-s-o/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/d-e-s-o/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/d-e-s-o/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/d-e-s-o/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/user

release of ripgrep that mostly has bug fixes,\r\nsome minor performance improvements and minor new features.\r\n\r\n> In case you haven't heard of it before, ripgrep is a line-oriented search\r\n> tool that recursively searches the current directory for a regex pattern.\r\n> By default, ripgrep will respect gitignore rules and automatically skip\r\n> hidden files/directories and binary files.\r\n\r\nHere are some highlights:\r\n\r\n* Several bugs around gitignore matching have been fixed. This includes\r\n  a commonly reported bug related to applying gitignore rules from parent\r\n  directories.\r\n* A memory usage regression when handling very large gitignore files has been\r\n  fixed.\r\n* `rg -vf file`, where `file` is empty, now matches everything.\r\n* The `-r/--replace` flag now works with `--json`.\r\n* A subset of Jujutsu (`jj`) repositories are now treated as if they were git\r\n  repositories. That is, ripgrep will respect `jj`'s gitignores.\r\n* Globs can now use nested curly braces.\r\n\r\nPlatform support:\r\n\r\n* `aarch64` for Windows now has release artifacts.\r\n* `powerpc64` no longer has release artifacts generated for it. The CI\r\n  release workflow stopped working, and I didn't deem it worth my time to\r\n  debug it. If someone wants this and can test it, I'd be happy to add it\r\n  back.\r\n* ripgrep binaries are now compiled with full LTO enabled. You may notice\r\n  small performance improvements from this and a modest decrease in binary\r\n  size.\r\n\r\nPerformance improvements:\r\n\r\n* [PERF #2111](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/2111):\r\n  Don't resolve helper binaries on Windows when `-z/--search-zip` isn't used.\r\n* [PERF

my fix for #3184, I actually had two fixes. One was a tweak to how we\nread data and the other was a tweak to how we determined how much of the\nbuffer we needed to keep around. It turns out that fixing #3184 only\nrequired the latter fix, found in commit\nd4b77a8d8967ce1bf701ec65ceb9a75e85e5f2e0. The former fix also helped the\nspecific case of #3184, but it ended up regressing `--line-buffered`.\n\nSpecifically, previous to 8c6595c215d1e24bed5b7b86e2b18f3c871439ef (the\nfirst fix), we would do one `read` syscall. This call might not fill our\ncaller provided buffer. And in particular, `stdin` seemed to fill fewer\nbytes than reading from a file. So the \"fix\" was to put `read` in a loop\nand keep calling it until the caller provided buffer was full or until\nthe stream was exhausted. This helped alleviate #3184 by amortizing\n`read` syscalls better.\n\nBut of course, in retrospect, this change is clearly contrary to how\n`--line-buffered` works. We specifically do _not_ want to wait around\nuntil the buffer is full. We want to read what we can, search it and\nmove on.\n\nSo this reverts the first fix but leaves the second, which still\nkeeps #3184 fixed and also fixes #3194 (the regression).\n\nThis reverts commit 8c6595c215d1e24bed5b7b86e2b18f3c871439ef.\n\nFixes #3194\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/3195/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/3195/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":20367141595,"node_id":"REFE_lADOAzJbyc7RTAWczwAAAAS9-erb","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/events/20367141595","actor":{"login":"BurntSushi","id":456674,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NjY3NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/456674?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi","html_url":"https://github.com/BurntSushi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"d47663b1b4548e4fa02d6e4b575718d0f5f5e7d6","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/commits/d47663b1b4548e4fa02d6e4b575718d0f5f5e7d6","created_at":"2025-10-19T15:06:41Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":20446347113,"node_id":"REFE_lADOAzJbyc7RTAWczwAAAATCsn9p","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/events/20446347113","actor":{"login":"netbsd-srcmastr","id":27641251,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3NjQxMjUx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/27641251?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/netbsd-srcmastr","html_url":"https://github.com/netbsd-srcmastr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/netbsd-srcmastr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/netbsd-srcmastr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/netbsd-srcmastr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/netbsd-srcmastr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/netbsd-srcmastr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/netbsd-srcmastr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/netbsd-srcmastr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/netbsd-srcmastr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/netbsd-srcmastr/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"d3e9eba87edddbec93139a3d5ded1048f71238f8","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/NetBSD/pkgsrc/commits/d3e9eba87edddbec93139a3d5ded1048f71238f8","created_at":"2025-10-23T06:31:57Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
