I have one letter of the alphabet (`r`) dedicated to just ripgrep. because typing `rg` would be too much for me. that's how much i use it. my alias actually invokes `rg -j1` so that i get deterministic output (FWIW)\r\n\r\n\r\nanyway, i know how line number printing behavior is determined by whether you're in a tty or not, and then you can still turn it on and off explicitly.\r\n\r\nPersonally, i find them a bit too annoying when i'm matching against stdin. since stdin is typically a stream, line numbers don't make sense. especially when i then want to copy paste the output to others, things can get confusing. so could we do a mode for `line-numbers-only-when-tty-and-stdin` or something?\r\n\r\nIf i'm the only one asking for this and/or it doesn't seem worth it, I'll learn how to live with it...\r\n\r\nso to be clear what I mean is, if you're in a terminal\r\n```\r\n> echo -e 'a\\nb\\nab' | r a # i wish i had no line numbers here\r\n1:a\r\n3:ab\r\n> echo -e 'a\\nb\\nab' > file.txt\r\n> r a file.txt # line numbers ok here\r\n1:a\r\n3:ab\r\n```\r\n\r\nThanks again. cheerios!","closed_by":{"login":"BurntSushi","id":456674,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NjY3NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/456674?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi","html_url":"https://github.com/BurntSushi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/380/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/380/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
