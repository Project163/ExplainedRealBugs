Something else is. It renders correctly as an ASCII hyphen in my `man` version `2.13.1`. My `man` comes from the `man-db` package on Archlinux, whose homepage is: https://gitlab.com/man-db/man-db\n\nIt also renders correctly using `man` on macOS. I don't have `gman` even though I have `coreutils` installed. I don't know how to install GNU man. All of the obvious searches don't show anything for me.\n\nAnd finally, to prove that ripgrep is not emitting some kind of weird hyphen, you can ask it to generate the man page:\n\n```\n$ rg --generate man | rg pre-glob\nflag. One possible mitigation to this is to use the \\fB\\-\\-pre-glob\\fP flag to\n\\fB\\-\\-pre-glob\\fP=\\fIGLOB\\fP\nmore \\fB\\-\\-pre-glob\\fP flags are given, then only files that match the given set\nthen it is possible to use \\fB\\-\\-pre\\fP \\fIpre-pdftotext\\fP \\fB--pre-glob\nMultiple \\fB\\-\\-pre-glob\\fP flags may be used. Globbing rules match\n```","author_association":"OWNER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/comments/3262645622/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"BurntSushi","id":456674,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NjY3NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/456674?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi","html_url":"https://github.com/BurntSushi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":19545409862,"node_id":"CE_lADOAzJbyc7KFfJTzwAAAASM_0lG","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/events/19545409862","actor":{"login":"BurntSushi","id":456674,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NjY3NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/456674?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi","html_url":"https://github.com/BurntSushi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2025-09-06T17:10:06Z","state_reason":"not_planned","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":19545410403,"node_id":"LE_lADOAzJbyc7KFfJTzwAAAASM_0tj","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/events/19545410403","actor":{"login":"BurntSushi","id":456674,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NjY3NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/456674?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi","html_url":"https://github.com/BurntSushi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2025-09-06T17:10:11Z","label":{"name":"invalid","color":"e6e6e6"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/comments/3262976892","html_url":"https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/3140#issuecomment-3262976892","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/3140","id":3262976892,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAzJbyc7CfRN8","user":{"login":"blyxxyz","id":15526524,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1NTI2NTI0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15526524?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/blyxxyz","html_url":"https://github.com/blyxxyz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blyxxyz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blyxxyz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blyxxyz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blyxxyz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blyxxyz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blyxxyz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blyxxyz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blyxxyz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/blyxxyz/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":

Please tick this box to confirm you have reviewed the above.\n\n- [x] I have a different issue.\n\n### What version of ripgrep are you using?\n\nripgrep 14.1.1\n\n### How did you install ripgrep?\n\nDNF\n\n### What operating system are you using ripgrep on?\n\nFedora 42\n\n### Describe your bug.\n\nIn the man page of `rg`, the following text appears:\n\n> then it is possible to use `--pre pre-pdftotext --pre-glob pre-pdftotext` command on files with a .pdf extension.\n\nThis sounds weird: surely it was intended as `--pre pre-pdftotext --pre-glob '*.pdf'`.\n\nThis is not a bug in Fedora packaging because when I run `rg --generate-man > rg-man; man ./rg-man`, it reads the same.\n\nThis is the corresponding fragment of the roff code:\n\n```\n$ rg --generate=man | rg -C3 \"on files with\"\n.sp\nthen it is possible to use \\fB\\-\\-pre\\fP \\fIpre-pdftotext\\fP \\fB--pre-glob\n'\\fP\\fI*.pdf\\fP\\fB'\\fP to make it so ripgrep only executes the\n\\fIpre-pdftotext\\fP command on files with a \\fI.pdf\\fP extension.\n.sp\nMultiple \\fB\\-\\-pre-glob\\fP flags may be used. Globbing rules match\n\\fBgitignore\\fP globs. Precede a glob with a \\fB!\\fP to exclude it.\n```\n\nI'm guessing there might be a roff syntax error but I haven't read up about that format.\n\n### What are the steps to reproduce the behavior?\n\n`man rg`\n\n### What is the actual behavior?\n\nShows \"`--pre-glob pre-pdftotext`\"\n\n### What is the expected behavior?\n\nShow \"`--pre-glob

release of ripgrep that mostly has bug fixes,\r\nsome minor performance improvements and minor new features.\r\n\r\n> In case you haven't heard of it before, ripgrep is a line-oriented search\r\n> tool that recursively searches the current directory for a regex pattern.\r\n> By default, ripgrep will respect gitignore rules and automatically skip\r\n> hidden files/directories and binary files.\r\n\r\nHere are some highlights:\r\n\r\n* Several bugs around gitignore matching have been fixed. This includes\r\n  a commonly reported bug related to applying gitignore rules from parent\r\n  directories.\r\n* A memory usage regression when handling very large gitignore files has been\r\n  fixed.\r\n* `rg -vf file`, where `file` is empty, now matches everything.\r\n* The `-r/--replace` flag now works with `--json`.\r\n* A subset of Jujutsu (`jj`) repositories are now treated as if they were git\r\n  repositories. That is, ripgrep will respect `jj`'s gitignores.\r\n* Globs can now use nested curly braces.\r\n\r\nPlatform support:\r\n\r\n* `aarch64` for Windows now has release artifacts.\r\n* `powerpc64` no longer has release artifacts generated for it. The CI\r\n  release workflow stopped working, and I didn't deem it worth my time to\r\n  debug it. If someone wants this and can test it, I'd be happy to add it\r\n  back.\r\n* ripgrep binaries are now compiled with full LTO enabled. You may notice\r\n  small performance improvements from this and a modest decrease in binary\r\n  size.\r\n\r\nPerformance improvements:\r\n\r\n* [PERF #2111](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/2111):\r\n  Don't resolve helper binaries on Windows when `-z/--search-zip` isn't used.\r\n* [PERF #2865](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/pull/2865):\r\n  Avoid using path canonicalization on Windows when emitting hyperlinks.\r\n* [PERF #3184](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/pull/3184):\r\n  Improve performance of large values with `-A/--after-context`.\r\n\r\nBug fixes:\r\n\r\n* [BUG
