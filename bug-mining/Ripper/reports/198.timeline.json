you add a switch e.g. --force-gitignore which would force usage of .gitignore files even when there's no .git directory?\r\n\r\nGive a large repo, it's often convenient to archive versions of it and not save the .git directory. Currently ripgrep 11.0.2 does not pay attention to .gitignore files if there's no .git directory. This makes it impossible to use rg on such repo's. Another use case is when using Perforce. Perforce pays attention to .gitignore files and does not have a .git directory. A work around is to create an empty .git directory, but in our environment this causes problems because git based tools fail when there's an empty .git directory.\r\n\r\nThanks for ripgrep - it's really powerful!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/1414/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/1414/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":3044952754,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDMwNDQ5NTI3NTQ=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/events/3044952754","actor":{"login":"BurntSushi","id":456674,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NjY3NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/456674?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi","html_url":"https://github.com/BurntSushi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"d0659282e65dde46e0b5f373d89042b2fe1d4884","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/commits/d0659282e65dde46e0b5f373d89042b2fe1d4884","created_at":"2020-02-17T20:36:24Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3045136791,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDMwNDUxMzY3OTE=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/events/3045136791","actor":{"login":"BurntSushi","id":456674,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NjY3NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/456674?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi","html_url":"https://github.com/BurntSushi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"711426a632aee0affb7009cd8e3492c4ff7273e8","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/commits/711426a632aee0affb7009cd8e3492c4ff7273e8","created_at":"2020-02-17T22:16:40Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
