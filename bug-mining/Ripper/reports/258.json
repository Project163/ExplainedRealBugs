I found this problem while introducing ripgrep to a coworker and noticed how it was operating slowly (relative to what I'm used to) on his machine. Then I downloaded it to mine and noticed the same performance difference.\r\n\r\n#### Describe your question, feature request, or bug.\r\n\r\nI'm seeing a ~5x slowdown for identical searches on identical files (results repeatable).\r\n\r\n#### If this is a bug, what are the steps to reproduce the behavior?\r\n\r\nI cannot include the corpus of my own work repository so I tried with the Open Office repo where I see a slowdown of 3-4x:\r\n$ time /local/rulch/rg1100/ripgrep-11.0.0-x86_64-unknown-linux-musl/rg --debug okay > out-new 2>&1\r\n\r\nreal\t0m0.808s\r\nuser\t0m4.724s\r\nsys\t0m3.192s\r\n\r\n$ time /local/rulch/rg10/ripgrep-0.10.0-x86_64-unknown-linux-musl/rg --debug okay > out-old 2>&1\r\n\r\nreal\t0m0.252s\r\nuser\t0m1.304s\r\nsys\t0m1.328s\r\n\r\nOpen Office Repo: https://github.com/apache/openoffice @ commit 633ece0517\r\n\r\nPlease see the attachments for the new and old output with --debug provided.\r\n[out-new.txt](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/files/3113392/out-new.txt)\r\n[out-old.txt](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/files/3113393/out-old.txt)\r\n\r\nIn the Open Office repository it's not all that significant in terms of absolute time, but in my repository at work it causes searches to take a few seconds as opposed to half a second (at least for a small'ish number of results) on a 24 core machine. With less powerful CPUs I can see this being pretty impactful. It's annoying but still faster than grep. Is there some default behavior that changed from 0.10 to 11.0.0 that could explain this?
