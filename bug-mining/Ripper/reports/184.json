I investigated some more and ran the same benchmark (`fd -uu '[0-9]\\.jpg$'` in my home folder) multiple times while changing the version of the ignore crate:\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4209276/36641938-2a14fe2c-1a38-11e8-9870-f11e8f999707.png)\r\n\r\nThere are two things to notice:\r\n1. The timing for `ignore-0.3.0` is not visisble because it's so fast (137 ms). This is due to a bug where not all results are shown (I didn't investigate further, but the git log seems to indicate that something was wrong with `ignore-0.3.0`).\r\n2. There is a small (but statistically significant) performance regression that seems to have been introduced with commit 3cb4d13 (Custom ignore files). Interestingly, I'm running a search that doesn't even use ignore files (`-uu` is the same as in ripgrep).\r\n\r\n#### What are the steps to reproduce the behavior?\r\n\r\nI can reproduce this behavior with ripgrep itself:\r\n\r\n```\r\n▶ git checkout 51864c1; cargo install -f\r\n\r\n...\r\n\r\n▶ hyperfine --warmup 10 'rg -uu --files --iglob \"*[0-9].jpg\" ~'\r\nBenchmark #1: rg -uu --files --iglob \"*[0-9].jpg\" ~\r\n\r\n  Time (mean ± σ):     700.4 ms ±   5.3 ms    [User: 3.157 s, System: 2.310 s]\r\n \r\n  Range (min … max):   691.4 ms … 709.0 ms\r\n\r\n▶ git checkout 3cb4d13; cargo install -f\r\n\r\n...\r\n\r\n▶ hyperfine --warmup 10 'rg -uu --files --iglob \"*[0-9].jpg\" ~'\r\nBenchmark #1: rg -uu --files --iglob \"*[0-9].jpg\" ~\r\n\r\n  Time (mean ± σ):     725.4 ms ±   7.9 ms    [User: 3.318 s, System: 2.338 s]\r\n \r\n  Range (min … max):   715.5 ms … 743.9 ms\r\n```\r\n(benchmarks performed with [hyperfine](https://github.com/sharkdp/hyperfine) on a warm disk cache)\r\n\r\nAgain, the difference is small (~4%) but significant.","closed_by":{"login":"BurntSushi","id":456674,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NjY3NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/456674?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi","html_url":"https://github.com/BurntSushi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/835/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/835/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
