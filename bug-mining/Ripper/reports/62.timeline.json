commit completely guts all of the color handling code and replaces\r\nmost of it with two new crates: wincolor and termcolor. wincolor\r\nprovides a simple API to coloring using the Windows console and\r\ntermcolor provides a platform independent coloring API tuned for\r\nmultithreaded command line programs. This required a lot more\r\nflexibility than what the `term` crate provided, so it was dropped.\r\nWe instead switch to writing ANSI escape sequences directly and ignore\r\nthe TERMINFO database.\r\n\r\nIn addition to fixing several bugs, this commit also permits end users\r\nto customize colors to a certain extent. For example, this command will\r\nset the match color to magenta and the line number background to yellow:\r\n\r\n    rg --colors 'match:fg:magenta' --colors 'line:bg:yellow' foo\r\n\r\nFor tty handling, we've adopted a hack from `git` to do tty detection in\r\nMSYS/mintty terminals. As a result, ripgrep should get both color\r\ndetection and piping correct on Windows regardless of which terminal you\r\nuse.\r\n\r\nFinally, switch to line buffering. Performance doesn't seem to be\r\nimpacted and it's an otherwise more user friendly option.\r\n\r\nFixes #37, Fixes #51, Fixes #94, Fixes #117, Fixes #182, Fixes #231","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/240/reactions","total_count":4,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":3,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/240/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":865646593,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDg2NTY0NjU5Mw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/events/865646593","actor":{"login":"BurntSushi","id":456674,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NjY3NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/456674?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi","html_url":"https://github.com/BurntSushi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"e8a30cb8934106e63f9d0938c547e535acb7b888","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/commits/e8a30cb8934106e63f9d0938c547e535acb7b888","created_at":"2016-11-20T16:14:59Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":865704570,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50ODY1NzA0NTcw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/events/865704570","actor":{"login":"BurntSushi","id":456674,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NjY3NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/456674?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi","html_url":"https://github.com/BurntSushi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2016-11-20T20:01:11Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/comments/262191624","html_url":"https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/37#issuecomment-262191624","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/37","id":262191624,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2MjE5MTYyNA==","user":{"login":"kaushalmodi","id":3578197,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1NzgxOTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3578197?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaushalmodi","html_url":"https://github.com/kaushalmodi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaushalmodi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaushalmodi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaushalmodi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaushalmodi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaushalmodi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaushalmodi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaushalmodi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaushalmodi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaushalmodi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-11-22T09:36:10Z","updated_at":"2016-11-22T09:36:10Z","body":"Thanks.

you used old versions of ripgrep (0.3.0) in an xterm that had color disabled, they simply bolded some portions of the output (it looks like file names, line numbers, and matching text). Versions from 0.3.0 onwards do truly unreadable things in this environment. Everything that used to be bolded now *blinks*, and matching text has a ~~strike~~ through it. Given the blinking, the result is not in the least bit usable.\r\n\r\nCan the old behavior be restored on non-color xterms? Better yet, can we also get an option that always does this (even when color is available)? Even in environments with colors I would often prefer not to use them and would rather have things just come out as bold.\r\n\r\n(In theory color can make things more readable. In practice automatically chosen highlight colors don't always go with certain choices of foreground and background colors. I use black text on white background, which clashes with most color schemes; they often seem designed for white on
