Using Gnu man on mac the rg.1 man page shows switches as `--case‐sensitive` and `--files‐without‐match` where the leading hyphens are properly Ascii HYPHEN-MINUS #x2d but the interior ones are Unicode HYPHEN #x2010 which makes it difficult to search for the option name. (I think/hope this came through properly on GitHub).\n\n### What are the steps to reproduce the behavior?\n\n$ gman rg\n\n### What is the actual behavior?\n\n```\n       --pre‐glob=GLOB\n           This  flag works in conjunction with the --pre flag. Namely, when one or more --pre‐glob flags are given, then only files that match the given set of globs will be handed to the command specified\n           by the --pre flag. Any non‐matching files will be searched without using the preprocessor command.\n```\n\n### What is the expected behavior?\n\nhyphen in switch names should be ascii hyphen-minus as you would type them so they can be cut and pasted to a command line.","closed_by":{"login":"BurntSushi","id":456674,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NjY3NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/456674?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi","html_url":"https://github.com/BurntSushi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/3140/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/3140/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
