But I use ripgrep as `rg`, which means that every time I want to check for updates I have to remember what the program's official name is so that I can hunt it down. So I think it would be convenient if one or both of `rg --version` and `rg --help` mentioned that the official full name was 'ripgrep'. It would be great if `rg --help` also mentioned the master repository URL.\n\n(The manpage mentions that rg is ripgrep, but I don't always remember to put the manpage somewhere that `man rg` can find it because I only put the `rg` command in my personal `$HOME/bin` directory. And even the manpage doesn't mention authorship information or the master repository URL.)\n","closed_by":{"login":"BurntSushi","id":456674,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NjY3NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/456674?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi","html_url":"https://github.com/BurntSushi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/203/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/203/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
