`ripgrep` isn't just for Rust people though. There are plenty of non-English speaking countries where UTF-8 isn't quite _everywhere_. There's enough folks that care about it that there are at least a couple search tools that do implement searching on files that aren't UTF-8. [The Platinum Searcher](https://github.com/monochromegane/the_platinum_searcher) and [highway](https://github.com/tkengo/highway) come to mind. Of course, both `grep` and `git grep` support other encodings as well. I'm also told that Windows has lots of UTF-16 data too.\n\nAnyway, it's totally possible that this may never happen. But it's also a somewhat feasible thing to support without sacrificing performance for the UTF-8 case (at the cost of some code complexity). It is honestly somewhat low on my list of things I'd like to do with

yesterday, I was given a dump of log files from a Windows server, and took a while to figure out why I couldn't find the string that someone else reported as being in one of the files, when I was using `grep -r` to look for it. Took me a bit to figure out that while most of the files were in some ASCII compatible encoding, a few of them were in UTF-16.\n\nFor a tool that does recursive grepping, a lot of times what you have is some big directory tree, and you don't really know what's in it, and so you're looking for some needle in that big haystack. Not knowing what's in it can include not knowing the encoding.\n\nRight now, what `rg` does is skip UTF-16 files as binary, and not report anything about them, so you wouldn't notice if you missed files due to this issue.\n\nI think you do want something that applies a heuristic to determine the encoding, though I'm not sure you want that by default.\n\nI think the way I would go about supporting this is by reporting files that could be text but are not valid UTF-8; so, those files which it's searching as invalid UTF-8, and those which it's detecting as binary but which could be UTF-16, UTF-16BE, or UTF-16LE, or possibly other encodings. If you don't at least report something, you won't know that you're missing something due to the encoding issue, but I'm not sure you'd want to do any kind of automatic encoding detection by default.\n\nThen you could add a flag that will do heuristic encoding detection, based on BOM for UTF-16, or [even/odd nulls hack](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=631751) for UTF-16 BE or LE, or maybe even [character frequency based detection](http://www-archive.mozilla.org/projects/intl/UniversalCharsetDetection.html) for other encodings.\n","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/comments/249344584/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"lambda","id":37398,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3Mzk4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/37398?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lambda","html_url":"https://github.com/lambda","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lambda/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lambda/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lambda/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lambda/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lambda/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lambda/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lambda/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lambda/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lambda/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/comments/249345393","html_url":"https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/1#issuecomment-249345393","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/1","id":249345393,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI0OTM0NTM5Mw==","user":{"login":"BurntSushi","id":456674,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NjY3NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/456674?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi","html_url":"https://github.com/BurntSushi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-09-24T04:56:05Z","updated_at":"2016-09-24T04:56:05Z","body":"@lambda I agree we need to do something, but we are definitely limited.
