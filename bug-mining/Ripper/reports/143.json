Specifically, a search like the following will fail:\r\n\r\n```\r\nrg -S 'foo\\w' <<< FOOBAR\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is because it expands the class `\\w` and discovers that it contains the range of upper-case characters `A-Z`.\r\n\r\n`ag` uses a different metric: It simply checks the input pattern byte by byte to see if there's an upper-case character in the ASCII range. This works out in the `foo\\w` case, but it will fail in the similarly obvious case of `foo\\S` (which `rg` happens to get right) — not to mention multi-byte stuff like `É` and `ß`.\r\n\r\nThere are also more complicated cases where they both fail in different ways, like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\nrg -S '\\p{Ll}' <<< FOOBAR\r\n```\r\n\r\n`rg` returns a match here, because `\\p{Ll}` expands to only lower-case characters. But i think this should be treated as an 'explicit' range, like `[A-Z]` would be.\r\n\r\nAt the very least, though, i feel like something as basic as `foo\\w` should probably work as expected with smart case.\r\n\r\nIs there any way to determine through the AST the actual input that produced a class? Or would that be easy to add? I'm not sure i'm at the level yet where i should be messing with the `regex` crate, but that seems like it'd be a convenient way to sort it.\r\n\r\nThe easiest 'good enough' alternative that comes to mind would be to do a semi-naïve scan of the pattern that's just smart enough to ignore stuff like short-hand classes, but that feels kind of dumb (especially since i get the impression that you don't really care for this feature in the first place...).","closed_by":{"login":"BurntSushi","id":456674,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NjY3NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/456674?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi","html_url":"https://github.com/BurntSushi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/717/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/717/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
