Right now I'm working around this by using an absolute path to a script, `~/src/repo/.git/hooks/git-diff-cached.sh`, but this is a very inelegant approach. It requires me to hardcode the repo's path in the hook. If I want to use this hook in multiple repos I have to either update that path every time or put the script in one central location.\r\n\r\nI've attempted to use process substitution, `rg -Fl --pre <(printf 'git diff --cached -- $1')  'DO NOT COMMIT'` but named pipes are created without execute permission.\r\n\r\nHence, my feature request. Would it be possible to add a flag specifying arguments to be passed to the preprocessing command or having a separate `--pre-script` flag we can pass a string to rather than a file?\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"BurntSushi","id":456674,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NjY3NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/456674?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi","html_url":"https://github.com/BurntSushi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/2046/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/2046/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
