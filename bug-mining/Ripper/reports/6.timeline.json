seems that specifying a path in a `.gitignore` which has a trailing slash, such as\n\n```\na/\n```\n\n(as opposed to simply `a`) causes `rg --files` to fail to correctly ignore files within that directory. This only happens when an absolute path is supplied as an argument.\n### Steps to reproduce\n\nHere's a shell session that shows the problem. In it I create a directory, ignore it, and then show that the files within that directory are correctly ignored if I run `rg --files` or `rg --files ignored .` (see https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/64 for why I've included the word `ignored` in that invocation), but not if I run `rg --files ignored $PWD`.\n\nIf I either specify the path as `.`, or remove the trailing slash from the line in `.gitignore`, the directory is correctly ignored.\n\n```\n$ uname -mrsv\nDarwin 15.6.0 Darwin Kernel Version 15.6.0: Mon Aug 29 20:21:34 PDT 2016;
