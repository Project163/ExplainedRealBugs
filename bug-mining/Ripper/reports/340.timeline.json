is a draft for what could be a unified diff output for ripgrep when using the `--replace` option.\r\n\r\nThe chance for acceptance is low considering the feature request #74 was closed,\r\nhowever this is an implementation of @samuelcolvin suggestion to produce a diff output format\r\ninstead of actually writing to files. The job of changing files can then be handed to something like `patch` or `git apply`.\r\n\r\nI wanted to at least investigate what this would look like and managed to get something working,\r\nso I hope this can be a way to discuss around some actual code. @BurntSushi stated they were\r\nactively looking to moving more functionality into a library, so I'm not sure if this was totally dismissed.\r\n\r\nI ran into a few problems with the replacement buffer which seems to contain more than the original match\r\nand I managed to reproduce this with ripgrep 13.0.0, notes are in the code. I managed to get it working by\r\nmodifying the replacement, not sure but it could be related to #2095.\r\nThere is also no support for additional context, as that would require keeping track of it before and after a match\r\nto then produce the correct hunk header with context included, and I'm not very familiar with the code or rust\r\nto come up with a nice way to do that.\r\n\r\nThe implementation is mostly taken from the JSON printer with necessary parts replaced.\r\nIt can handle multiline replacements that differ in the amount of lines before/after replacement.\r\n\r\nI've tested mostly with running the following in the ripgrep repo:\r\n```\r\nrg -U '\\.A\\n' --replace 'BB'\r\nrg -U '.A\\nB' --replace 'BB' UNLICENSE\r\n```\r\nas these also produced the spurious output I found with rg 13.0.0.\r\n\r\nOutstanding stuff to leave draft status:\r\n - [ ] unit tests\r\n - [ ] better flag handling (--diff should somehow require you to use --replace)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/2149/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/2149/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/comments/1049184817","html_url":"https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/2095#issuecomment-1049184817","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/2095","id":1049184817,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAzJbyc4-iUox","user":{"login":"ghost","id":10137,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMTM3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10137?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost","html_url":"https://github.com/ghost","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-02-23T20:27:46Z","updated_at":"2022-02-23T20:27:46Z","body":"I ran into this problem when working on a unified diff printer.

furthers our kludge of dealing with PCRE2's look-around in the\r\nprinter. Because of our bad abstraction boundaries, we added a kludge to\r\ndeal with PCRE2 look-around by extending the bytes we search by a fixed\r\namount to hopefully permit any look-around to operate. But because of\r\nthat kludge, we wind up over extending ourselves in some cases and\r\ndragging along those extra bytes.\r\n\r\nWe had fixed this for simple searching by simply rejecting any matches\r\npast the end point. But we didn't do the same for replacements. So this\r\ncommit extends our kludge to replacements.\r\n\r\nThanks to @sonohgong for diagnosing the problem and proposing a fix. I\r\nmostly went with their solution, but adding the new replacement routine\r\nas an internal helper rather than a new APIn in the 'grep-matcher'\r\ncrate.\r\n\r\nFixes #2095, Fixes
