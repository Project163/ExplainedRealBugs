If you can get a list of dependency versions in which the test failures occurred, I can try testing that config. One of the things that happened somewhat recently was a memchr upgrade (from an old version to a rewrite). I wonder if that's the culprit.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, [this bug](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/issues/6471) is making it difficult for me to make progress. To clarify, every time Cargo tries to update its index, I'm getting this error, e.g.,\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ cargo update -p memchr --precise 2.0.2\r\n    Updating crates.io index\r\nerror: Unable to update
