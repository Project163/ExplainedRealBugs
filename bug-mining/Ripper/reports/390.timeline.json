for the feature request. But there are some things I don't understand. Please consider that when filing feature requests, that not every uses macOS. So it would help to provide more details. Some questions I have for example:\r\n\r\n* I have no idea what it means to \"run without Rosetta 2.\" Probably because I don't know what Rosetta 2 is. But even if I did, I don't know what it means to produce a binary without it.\r\n* I don't know what you mean by a \"universal binary\" in the feature title. Universal in what sense?\r\n\r\nEither way, I don't see myself spending time on this any time soon. If someone else wanted to work on this, then my requirements are probably the following:\r\n\r\n1. It should work with Rust stable. I'm open to something that only works with Rust nightly, but it should be using something that is on track to be stabilized and is unlikely to see major changes.\r\n2. It should work with `cross`. @shepmaster's instructions look great, but I'd really prefer that it work like other binaries that are produced via cross compiling.\r\n3. And finally, that it can be done automatically via GitHub Actions.\r\n\r\nIf these requirements aren't met, then I'd probably say that Rust and macOS arm aren't ready yet. The main thing I want to avoid is adding CI for a binary that breaks frequently.","author_association":"OWNER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/comments/732224438/reactions","total_count":5,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":5,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"BurntSushi","id":456674,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NjY3NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/456674?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi","html_url":"https://github.com/BurntSushi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":4028173541,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50NDAyODE3MzU0MQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/events/4028173541","actor":{"login":"shepmaster","id":174509,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NDUwOQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/174509?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/shepmaster","html_url":"https://github.com/shepmaster","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shepmaster/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shepmaster/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shepmaster/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shepmaster/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shepmaster/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shepmaster/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shepmaster/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shepmaster/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shepmaster/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-11-23T15:14:40Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":4028173548,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDQwMjgxNzM1NDg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/events/4028173548","actor":{"login":"shepmaster","id":174509,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NDUwOQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/174509?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/shepmaster","html_url":"https://github.com/shepmaster","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shepmaster/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shepmaster/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shepmaster/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shepmaster/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shepmaster/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shepmaster/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shepmaster/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shepmaster/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shepmaster/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-11-23T15:14:40Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":4028174311,"node_id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDQwMjgxNzQzMTE=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/events/4028174311","actor":{"login":"BurntSushi","id":456674,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NjY3NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/456674?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi","html_url":"https://github.com/BurntSushi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-11-23T15:14:49Z","label":{"name":"help

binary release of delta 0.4.5 for macOS created by the \"Continuous\r\nDeployment\" GitHub Actions workflow does not run on older macOS, like\r\n10.11 (El Capitan) [1].\r\n\r\nThe Rust compiler, rustc, by default, will build macOS binaries\r\ncompatible with macOS 10.7 or newer [2], [3], but some *-sys crates invoke a\r\nC compiler and thus will target the macOS version the C compiler is\r\nrunning on [4], thus limiting the compatibility of the resulting\r\nbinary. The macOS virtual machines used on GitHub Actions run macOS\r\n10.15.7, and since delta depends on some *-sys crates, the delta binary\r\nbuilt by cargo targets macOS 10.15, as can be verified by using the\r\nfollowing command:\r\n\r\n    $ otool -l ./target/x86_64-apple-darwin/release/delta | grep LC_BUILD_VERSION -A4\r\n    cmd LC_BUILD_VERSION\r\n    cmdsize 32\r\n    platform 1\r\n    sdk 10.15.6\r\n    minos 10.15\r\n\r\nor, if building locally on an older macOS versions, (here 10.11):\r\n\r\n    $ otool -l ./target/debug/delta | grep  LC_VERSION_MIN_MACOSX -A2\r\n    cmd LC_VERSION_MIN_MACOSX\r\n    cmdsize 16\r\n    version 10.11\r\n\r\nTo restore compatibility with older macOS version, explicitely set the environment\r\nvariable `MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET` to the default for rustc, \"10.7\".\r\nThis will make the `clang` C compiler invoked by *-sys crates also\r\ntarget 10.7, thus restoring the compatibility of the delta binary.\r\n\r\nFor simplicity, add this variable to the environment for all platforms,\r\nwhich should not have any effect on non-macOS platforms.\r\n\r\n[1] https://github.com/dandavison/delta/issues/462\r\n[2]
