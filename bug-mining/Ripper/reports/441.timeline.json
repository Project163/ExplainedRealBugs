From the man page:\r\n\r\n```\r\n       The precedence of ignore rules is as follows, with later items overriding earlier items:\r\n\r\n       •  Files given by --ignore-file.\r\n\r\n       •  Global gitignore rules, e.g., from $HOME/.config/git/ignore.\r\n\r\n       •  Local rules from .git/info/exclude.\r\n\r\n       •  Rules from .gitignore.\r\n\r\n       •  Rules from .ignore.\r\n\r\n       •  Rules from .rgignore.\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn other words, `--ignore-file` has the lowest precedence and is overruled by your `.gitignore`. The whitelist rule in `.ignore` works because `.ignore` specifically has higher precedence.\r\n\r\nThe docs for `--ignore-file` appear misleading or perhaps even wrong:\r\n\r\n```\r\n       --ignore-file=PATH\r\n           Specifies a path to one or more gitignore formatted rules files.
