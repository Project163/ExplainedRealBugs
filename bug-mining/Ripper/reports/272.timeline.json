#1291 \r\n\r\nThis is a first shot at addressing #1291, though I think some additional input is needed.\r\n\r\nAfter reviewing and manually testing, I found that the source of the errors being raised was due to unconditionally building an `OverrideBuilder` from the globbing options. As this relies on the current working directory, it understandably fails when the cwd does not exist.\r\n\r\nThe immediate error can be suppressed by checking that the globbing options are actually required before attempting to handle them. This will still raise the same error when any of these options are present without an existing cwd, though perhaps a clearer error message could also be emitted as part of this change in that case.\r\n\r\nOn the testing front, I wasn't able to suitably recreate the original issue in a regression test. In my experiments, I tried to set the `current_dir` of the `TestCommand` to something non-existent before running, but this seemed to result in a panic before actually entering any ripgrep code when we go to execute the command.\r\n\r\nManual testing showed that we were able to execute non-globbing ripgrep commands without failure from a non-existent cwd with this change applied.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/1400/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":1,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/1400/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/comments/549112367","html_url":"https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/1291#issuecomment-549112367","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/1291","id":549112367,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU0OTExMjM2Nw==","user":{"login":"yump","id":2214413,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyMTQ0MTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2214413?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yump","html_url":"https://github.com/yump","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yump/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yump/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yump/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yump/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yump/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yump/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yump/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yump/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yump/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-11-03T07:33:29Z","updated_at":"2019-11-03T07:33:29Z","body":"I encountered this because I was sitting in `/proc/$some_app_pid`, rg-ing through `smaps`.
