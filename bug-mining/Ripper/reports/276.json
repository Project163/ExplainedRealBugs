Moreover,\r\nthis Rust program correctly prints `true`:\r\n\r\n```rust\r\nfn main() {\r\n    let pattern = r\"CCAGCTACTCGGGAGGCTGAGGCTGGAGGATCGCTTGAGTCCAGGAG[ATCG]{2}C\";\r\n    let haystack = \"CCAGCTACTCGGGAGGCTGAGGCTGGAGGATCGCTTGAGTCCAGGAGTTC\";\r\n\r\n    let re = regex::Regex::new(pattern).unwrap();\r\n    println!(\"{:?}\", re.is_match(haystack));\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhich points the finger at `grep-regex`'s inner literal extraction.
