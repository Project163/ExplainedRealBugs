What version of ripgrep are you using?\r\n\r\n`rg --version\r\n\r\nripgrep 13.0.0\r\n-SIMD -AVX (compiled)\r\n+SIMD +AVX (runtime)`\r\n\r\n#### How did you install ripgrep?\r\n\r\ncargo install\r\n\r\n#### What operating system are you using ripgrep on?\r\n\r\nArchlinux 5.17.4-arch1-1\r\n\r\n#### Describe your bug.\r\n\r\nWhen we use the replace flag -r, some characters seem to break the replaced result \r\nif they are placed just after a capture group like $1.\r\nFor example underscore (_).\r\n\r\n#### What are the steps to reproduce the behavior?\r\n\r\nRun \r\n`ls file.mkv | rg '(.*).mkv' -r '$1_en.ass'`\r\nHere, _ is just after the 1 in '$1', and it will break the output.\r\nThis also happen if we have any alphabet letter after the 1.\r\n\r\n#### What is the actual behavior?\r\n\r\nHere are some commands i tried.\r\n\r\n`\r\nls file.mkv | rg '(.*).mkv' -r '$1_en.ass'`\r\n`.ass`\r\nThe $1 is ignored and _ has apparently eaten the \"en\" part of the pattern.\r\n\r\n`ls file.mkv | rg '(.*).mkv' -r '$1$_en.ass'`\r\n`file.ass`\r\nSince $$ is used to escape $, i tried to write $_, \r\nand while it still eats the \"en\" part, the $1 is correctly replaced this time.\r\n\r\n`ls file.mkv | rg '(.*).mkv' -r '$1 en.ass'`\r\n`file en.ass`\r\nHere we can see that the output is correct if a space follow the 1, this is also the case for ., !, and probably others.\r\n\r\n#### What is the expected behavior?\r\n\r\nThe expected behavior to the first command listed above is : \r\n`file_en.ass`\r\n\r\n\r\nI think this is a bug, but if this is intentional, then please show me where in the doc i could have find this, because i have not.\r\nIs there a way to escape the capture group and/or find a way for underscore to not break the output ?\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"BurntSushi","id":456674,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NjY3NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/456674?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi","html_url":"https://github.com/BurntSushi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/2201/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/2201/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
