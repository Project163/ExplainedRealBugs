One way to do this would be to have fixed width line numbers in search results. This could be accomplished through an option flag and left-padding with either spaces or zeroes when the flag is active.\r\n\r\nAs this is primarily of interest for matches within a file, only the matches within a file need be considered for how wide the line numbers should be. Alternatively, one could have a pre-determined width (i.e. 6) and overflow larger line numbers.\r\n\r\nImplemented, this could look either like this:\r\n```\r\n$ rg needle --fixed-width-line-numbers\r\nhaystack.txt:\r\n 12:    needle {\r\n144:      needle {\r\n\r\nsilo.txt:\r\n  16:  } needle {\r\n 256:    } // needle 1\r\n 512:    } // needle 2\r\n1024:  } // needles\r\n\r\nwarehouse.txt:\r\n   1234:  - needle ( 5 boxes )\r\n1234567:  - needle ( 20 boxes ) \r\n```\r\n\r\nOr like this:\r\n```\r\n$ rg needle --fixed-width-line-numbers\r\nhaystack.txt:\r\n    12:    needle {\r\n   144:      needle {\r\n\r\nsilo.txt:\r\n    16:  } needle {\r\n   256:    } // needle 1\r\n   512:    } // needle 2\r\n  1024:  } // needles\r\n\r\nwarehouse.txt:\r\n  1234:  - needle (5 boxes)\r\n1234567:  - needle (20 boxes)\r\n```","closed_by":{"login":"BurntSushi","id":456674,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NjY3NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/456674?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi","html_url":"https://github.com/BurntSushi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/544/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/544/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
