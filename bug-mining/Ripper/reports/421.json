As far as I can tell, this is not documented, so I don't believe it's intentional. There is a parenthetical in the `-q` helptext that says the exit code \"will be an error code if no matches are found\", but since it's a parenthetical, I interpret that as explaining the default exit code behavior.\n\nIf this is the intended behavior, I think that should be more explicit in the helptext; perhaps something like:\n\n> The exit code will be an error code if no matches are found. This overrides other flags that may change the exit code, such as --files-without-match.\n\n### What are the steps to reproduce the behavior?\n\n```sh\n$> echo haystack ...... | rg -q needle; echo $?\n1\n$> echo haystack needle | rg -q needle; echo $?\n0\n$> echo haystack ...... | rg --files-without-match needle > /dev/null; echo $?\n0\n$> echo haystack needle | rg --files-without-match needle > /dev/null; echo $?\n1\n$> echo haystack ...... | rg -q --files-without-match needle > /dev/null; echo $?\n1\n$> echo haystack needle | rg -q --files-without-match needle > /dev/null; echo $?\n0\n```\n\n\n### What is the actual behavior?\n\n`-q` inverts the exit code, effectively ignoring `--files-without-match`.\n\n### What is the expected behavior?\n\nI would expect `-q` not to change the exit code.","closed_by":{"login":"BurntSushi","id":456674,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NjY3NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/456674?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi","html_url":"https://github.com/BurntSushi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/3108/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/3108/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
