is an awesome bug, thanks for the report!\n\nThe issue was that I got a bit overzealous with partial error reporting. Namely, when processing a gitignore file, we should try to use every pattern even if some patterns are invalid globs (e.g., `a**b`). In the process, I applied the same logic to I/O errors. In this case, it manifest by attempting to read lines from a directory, which appears to yield `Result`s forever, where each `Result` is an error of the form \"you can't read from a directory silly.\" Since I treated it as a partial error, ripgrep was just spinning and accruing each error in memory, which caused the OOM killer to kick in.\n","author_association":"OWNER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/comments/259535312/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":2,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"BurntSushi","id":456674,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NjY3NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/456674?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi","html_url":"https://github.com/BurntSushi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":853637707,"node_id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDg1MzYzNzcwNw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/events/853637707","actor":{"login":"BurntSushi","id":456674,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NjY3NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/456674?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi","html_url":"https://github.com/BurntSushi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2016-11-09T21:44:49Z","label":{"name":"bug","color":"fc2929"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":853639486,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50ODUzNjM5NDg2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/events/853639486","actor":{"login":"BurntSushi","id":456674,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NjY3NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/456674?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi","html_url":"https://github.com/BurntSushi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":"2dce0dc0df3c9ade3d89dd1ed673213d76760509","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/commits/2dce0dc0df3c9ade3d89dd1ed673213d76760509","created_at":"2016-11-09T21:46:27Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/comments/259538230","html_url":"https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/228#issuecomment-259538230","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/228","id":259538230,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI1OTUzODIzMA==","user":{"login":"andyleejordan","id":2226434,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyMjY0MzQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2226434?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/andyleejordan","html_url":"https://github.com/andyleejordan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andyleejordan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andyleejordan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andyleejordan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andyleejordan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andyleejordan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andyleejordan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andyleejordan/repos","events_url":"http
