Quick comparison of `git grep` and `rg` on a fixed-string pattern that is not found anywhere in the repository, after warming up the filesystem cache with `git grep` a few times:\n\n```\n$ time git grep thiswillnotbefound\n0.29suser 0.33skernel 0.135elapsed 459%CPU 26Mmaxmem\n0inputs+0outputs (0major+8952minor)pagefaults (39406voluntary+52in)switches\n\n$ time rg thiswillnotbefound\n3845.59suser 0.78skernel 8:01.86elapsed 798%CPU 130Mmaxmem\n0inputs+0outputs (0major+5543minor)pagefaults (51voluntary+133031in)switches\n```\n\nSomehow ripgrep is more than three orders of magnitude slower than `git grep` here, at 8 minutes versus 0.1 seconds. This is of course not a very good sample of results but I think with a difference that big you don't really need the details.
