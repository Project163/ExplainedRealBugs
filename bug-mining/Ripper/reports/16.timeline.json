seems that specifying a path in a `.gitignore` which has a trailing slash, such as\n\n```\na/\n```\n\n(as opposed to simply `a`) causes `rg --files` to fail to correctly ignore files within that directory. This only happens when an absolute path is supplied as an argument.\n### Steps to reproduce\n\nHere's a shell session that shows the problem. In it I create a directory, ignore it, and then show that the files within that directory are correctly ignored if I run `rg --files` or `rg --files ignored .` (see https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/64 for why I've included the word `ignored` in that invocation), but not if I run `rg --files ignored $PWD`.\n\nIf I either specify the path as `.`, or remove the trailing slash from the line in `.gitignore`, the directory is correctly ignored.\n\n```\n$ uname -mrsv\nDarwin 15.6.0 Darwin Kernel Version 15.6.0: Mon Aug 29 20:21:34 PDT 2016; root:xnu-3248.60.11~1/RELEASE_X86_64 x86_64\n$ rg --version\n0.1.17\n$ mkdir a\n$ touch x y a/x a/y\n$ echo a/ > .gitignore\n$ ag . -l -g ''\nx\ny\n$ ag $PWD -l -g ''\n/Users/redacted/mess/current/example/x\n/Users/redacted/mess/current/example/y\n$ rg --files ignored .\n./x\n./y\n$ rg --files ignored $PWD\n/Users/redacted/mess/current/example/a/x\n/Users/redacted/mess/current/example/a/y\n/Users/redacted/mess/current/example/x\n/Users/redacted/mess/current/example/y\n$ echo a > .gitignore\n$ rg --files ignored .\n./x\n./y\n$ rg --files ignored $PWD\n/Users/redacted/mess/current/example/x\n/Users/redacted/mess/current/example/y\n```\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/65/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/65/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/comments/249382143","html_url":"https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/64#issuecomment-249382143","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/64","id":249382143,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI0OTM4MjE0Mw==","user":{"login":"caipre","id":295094,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5NTA5NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/295094?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/caipre","html_url":"https://github.com/caipre","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caipre/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caipre/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caipre/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caipre/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caipre/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caipre/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caipre/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caipre/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caipre/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-09-24T19:12:05Z","updated_at":"2016-09-24T19:12:05Z","body":"Also very confused by this.
