GNU grep reports\r\n\r\n    Binary file <filename> matches\r\n\r\nI don't know if it is planned for ripgrep to search binary files as well at some point, for cases where you just want to know whether there is a match, not where; but either way the current behaviour seems a little bit confusing. In case rg is not meant to ever support binary files, maybe it could print a message like\r\n\r\n    <filename> contains non-printable characters. Use the --text flag if you want it to be treated as a plaintext file anyway.\r\n\r\nif there's only one file to be searched and it's recognized as a binary file (or maybe even if there's multiple file arguments but all seem to be binary).","closed_by":{"login":"BurntSushi","id":456674,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NjY3NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/456674?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi","html_url":"https://github.com/BurntSushi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/306/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/306/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
