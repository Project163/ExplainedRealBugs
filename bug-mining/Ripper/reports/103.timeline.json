I kind of side with you on this. I think showing line numbers when searching only stdin is a little strange. I'm not quite sure if the right answer is to remove them in that specific case, which I think is why I never bothered to change it. If you do pipe ripgrep into another program, e.g., `echo -e 'a\\nb\\nab' | rg a | cat`, then the line numbers disappear. But so do colors, which is a pain.","author_association":"OWNER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/comments/282322403/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"BurntSushi","id":456674,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NjY3NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/456674?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi","html_url":"https://github.com/BurntSushi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":976219440,"node_id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDk3NjIxOTQ0MA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/events/976219440","actor":{"login":"BurntSushi","id":456674,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NjY3NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/456674?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi","html_url":"https://github.com/BurntSushi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2017-02-24T15:40:00Z","label":{"name":"question","color":"cc317c"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/comments/282328266","html_url":"https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/380#issuecomment-282328266","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/380","id":282328266,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI4MjMyODI2Ng==","user":{"login":"Dieterbe","id":20774,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwNzc0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20774?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Dieterbe","html_url":"https://github.com/Dieterbe","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Dieterbe/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Dieterbe/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Dieterbe/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Dieterbe/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Dieterbe/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Dieterbe/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Dieterbe/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Dieterbe/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Dieterbe/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-02-24T16:01:08Z","updated_at":"2017-02-24T16:01:08Z","body":"oops yes.
