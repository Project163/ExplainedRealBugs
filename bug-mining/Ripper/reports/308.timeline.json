yes, the usage hints in the `-h/--help` output appear to have gotten out of sync with the man page. The man page has the correct usage hints. I've fixed that.\r\n\r\nThe usage hints were also written long before the config file functionality existed. So just running `rg` with no arguments never really made sense. There wouldn't be anything for `rg` to do. And even with support for config files, this is a rather extreme edge case. Configuration files were never really intended to be a way to supply 100% of all arguments to ripgrep. They are intended to solve the problem of passing common arguments. The only reason why this sort of thing even looks possible is because of the config file format: it's just CLI flags. If the config format were, say, a Yaml file, there wouldn't be any expectation that this would work I think.","author_association":"OWNER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/comments/727633095/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"BurntSushi","id":456674,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NjY3NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/456674?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi","html_url":"https://github.com/BurntSushi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":13413907063,"node_id":"REFE_lADOAzJbyc4sS7JazwAAAAMfh_p3","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/events/13413907063","actor":{"login":"kyagi","id":90729,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkwNzI5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/90729?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kyagi","html_url":"https://github.com/kyagi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kyagi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kyagi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kyagi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kyagi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kyagi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kyagi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kyagi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kyagi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kyagi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"f32e90601291f18559c376d2e51e214b58f7980b","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kyagi/ripgrep/commits/f32e90601291f18559c376d2e51e214b58f7980b","created_at":"2024-07-07T11:30:10Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
