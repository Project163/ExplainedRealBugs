The `-g/--glob` flag applies to _every_ file path searched. So the `-g a` behavior will cause ripgrep to descend into your `a` directory but _not_ your `b` directory. However, `a` doesn't match any file inside your `a` directory. You can confirm this behavior by adding a `a/a` file:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ echo hello > a/a\r\n$ rg -g a hello\r\na/a\r\n1:hello\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you do want to search everything in `a`, then you need to use a glob pattern that _both_ matches the directory and the the files inside of it:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ rg -g 'a/**' hello\r\na/a\r\n1:hello\r\n\r\na/test.txt\r\n1:hello\r\n```\r\n\r\nYour negation pattern works as you expect because it avoids descending into the `b` directory completely.\r\n\r\nWith all of this said, while the behavior is correct, the docs for the `--glob` flag could really be improved, so we can use this ticket to track that.","author_association":"OWNER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/comments/562605533/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"BurntSushi","id":456674,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NjY3NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/456674?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi","html_url":"https://github.com/BurntSushi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":2861688570,"node_id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDI4NjE2ODg1NzA=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/events/2861688570","actor":{"login":"BurntSushi","id":456674,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NjY3NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/456674?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi","html_url":"https://github.com/BurntSushi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-12-06T15:01:25Z","label":{"name":"doc","color":"fbca04"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/comments/562616936","html_url":"https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/1442#issuecomment-562616936","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/1442","id":562616936,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU2MjYxNjkzNg==","user":{"login":"w08r","id":3176756,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxNzY3NTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3176756?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/w08r","html_url":"https://github.com/w08r","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w08r/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w08r/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w08r/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w08r/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w08r/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w08r/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w08r/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w08r/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/w08r/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-12-06T15:27:25Z","updated_at":"2019-12-06T15:27:25Z","body":"Thanks

Apologies if I missed something!\r\n\r\n`rg -g '*glob*' ` does not match against filespaths of any depth\r\n\r\nIn plain english, I want to search files whose path contains `foo` and whose content contains the pattern `.*bar$`\r\n\r\n#### Expected behavior \r\n\r\nMy understanding is that I should be able to accomplish this with \r\n\r\n`rg -g  '*foo*' .*bar$`\r\n\r\nAs a concrete example (though I've removed the code and only returned result counts) \r\n\r\n```sh\r\nrg -g '*ulia*' titleize\\|titlecase | wc -l\r\n# => 0\r\n```\r\n^ I expect to get 3. I can achieve this with the following: \r\n\r\n```sh\r\nrg --files | rg ulia | xargs rg -l titleize\\|titlecase | wc -l\r\n# => 3\r\n```\r\n\r\nI think I expect the globbing to work somewhat similarly to the `ag` interface, e.g. \r\n` ag -G ulia \"titleize|titlecase\"`\r\n\r\nPerhaps I don't understand how unix globs work with nested file paths.  \r\n\r\nThanks for your time!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/1456/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/1456/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":3130579951,"node_id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDMxMzA1Nzk5NTE=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/events/3130579951","actor":{"login":"BurntSushi","id":456674,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NjY3NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/456674?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi","html_url":"https://github.com/BurntSushi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-03-15T14:30:08Z","label":{"name":"rollup","color":"ffccee"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3130717417,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDMxMzA3MTc0MTc=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/events/3130717417","actor":{"login":"BurntSushi","id":456674,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NjY3NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/456674?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi","html_url":"https://github.com/BurntSushi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"e7b177c1876ffb15173559e3112fa508ace53471","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/commits/e7b177c1876ffb15173559e3112fa508ace53471","created_at":"2020-03-15T16:43:23Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3130747860,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MzEzMDc0Nzg2MA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/events/3130747860","actor":{"login":"BurntSushi","id":456674,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NjY3NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/456674?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi","html_url":"https://github.com/BurntSushi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":"447506ebe02f1475734b66137feb02ae0fd9decf","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/commits/447506ebe02f1475734b66137feb02ae0fd9decf","created_at":"2020-03-15T17:19:17Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":13413906982,"node_id":"REFE_lADOAzJbyc4f1Ot1zwAAAAMfh_om","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/events/13413906982","actor":{"login":"kyagi","id":90729,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkwNzI5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/90729?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kyagi","html_url":"https://github.com/kyagi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kyagi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kyagi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kyagi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.g
