This looks like a bug in ripgrep's inner literal extractor. It thinks `ac` is a literal that must appear in every match, but this is obviously wrong. The regex engine prefix/suffix detection is correct:\r\n\r\n```\r\n[andrew@Cheetah ~]$ regex-debug prefixes 'a(.*c)'\r\nCut(a)\r\n[andrew@Cheetah ~]$ regex-debug suffixes 'a(.*c)'\r\nCut(c)\r\n```\r\n\r\nI diagnosed this from the `--debug` output. Cutting out the irrelevant stuff, you can see the problem here:\r\n\r\n```\r\n[andrew@Cheetah ~]$ echo abc | rg 'a(.*c)' --debug\r\nDEBUG|grep_regex::literal|grep-regex/src/literal.rs:110: required literal found: \"ac\"\r\n[andrew@Cheetah ~]$ echo abc | rg 'a.*c' --debug\r\nDEBUG|grep_regex::literal|grep-regex/src/literal.rs:110: required literal found: \"a\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nI would have thought this was a regression since I touched this code as part of libripgrep work, but 0.9.0 exhibits the same bug.","author_association":"OWNER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/comments/424110342/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"BurntSushi","id":456674,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NjY3NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/456674?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi","html_url":"https://github.com/BurntSushi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":1864086269,"node_id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDE4NjQwODYyNjk=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/events/1864086269","actor":{"login":"BurntSushi","id":456674,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NjY3NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/456674?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi","html_url":"https://github.com/BurntSushi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-09-24T20:17:46Z","label":{"name":"bug","color":"fc2929"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/comments/424110803","html_url":"https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/1064#issuecomment-424110803","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/1064","id":424110803,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQyNDExMDgwMw==","user":{"login":"phiresky","id":2303841,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMDM4NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2303841?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/phiresky","html_url":"https://github.com/phiresky","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phiresky/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phiresky/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phiresky/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phiresky/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phiresky/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phiresky/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phiresky/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phiresky/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phiresky/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-09-24T20:19:02Z","updated_at":"2018-09-24T20:19:02Z","body":"checking

on?\r\n\r\nArch Linux, using the Arch-official `ripgrep` package.\r\n\r\n#### Bug description/reproduction steps\r\n\r\nThis prints out \"abcd\".\r\n\r\n`echo 'abcd' | rg 'a(.*(d|ce))'`\r\n\r\nAdding a \"c\" makes it not match (i.e. it doesn't print out anything).\r\n\r\n`echo 'abcd' | rg 'a(.*(cd|ce))'`\r\n\r\n#### If this is a bug, what is the expected behavior?\r\n\r\nI believe that both regexes should match the input, and print out a match in both cases. Testing using [regex101](https://regex101.com/) seems to imply this is true.\r\n\r\n#### Real-world discovery background (non-minimal case that made me discover the minimal repro above):\r\n\r\nI was trying to run `git diff --name-only master... | rg 'js/src/(.*(cpp|\\.h))' --replace '$1'`.\r\n\r\n`git diff --name-only master...` printed lines such

extract:\r\n\r\n```\r\nfrontend/BytecodeEmitter.cpp\r\nfrontend/ParseNode.h\r\n```\r\n\r\n(i.e. trim `js/src/` off the front, and only match `cpp` and `h` files)\r\n\r\nHowever, adding a `\\.` in front of the `cpp` made *nothing* match.\r\n\r\n`git diff --name-only master... | rg 'js/src/(.*(\\.cpp|\\.h))' --replace '$1'` -- prints nothing???","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/1084/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/1084/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"actor":{"login":"okdana","id":122095,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMjA5NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/122095?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/okdana","html_url":"https://github.com/okdana","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/okdana/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/okdana/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/okdana/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/okdana/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/okdana/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/okdana/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/okdana/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/okdana/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/okdana/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-12-07T23:07:00Z","updated_at":"2018-12-07T23:07:00Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/1136","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/1136/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/1136/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/1136/events","html_url":"https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/1136","id":388843447,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWUzODg4NDM0NDc=","number":1136,"title":"ripgrep
