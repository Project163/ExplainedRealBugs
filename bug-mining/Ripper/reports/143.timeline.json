It should definitely work intuitively, and I basically agree with your analysis here.\r\n\r\nI think you are on the right track with respect to fixing this. The problem is that the regex \"AST\" isn't a true faithful AST. The parser itself does various transformations that cannot be reversed, so there is no way to \"see\" that a `\\w` was actually written as a `\\w` instead of a `[...]`.\r\n\r\nI have been working on a rewrite of the parser for quite some time now, and with it, a [proper AST](https://github.com/rust-lang/regex/blob/869d0067fe70e535607d02b7474eb0ed6c83c43c/regex-syntax-2/src/ast.rs). Once that is active (I'm not sure when that will be), then we can scan the AST and apply this heuristic with as much precision as we care to.","author_association":"OWNER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/comments/352408802/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"BurntSushi","id":456674,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NjY3NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/456674?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi","html_url":"https://github.com/BurntSushi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":1391973260,"node_id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDEzOTE5NzMyNjA=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/events/1391973260","actor":{"login":"BurntSushi","id":456674,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NjY3NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/456674?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi","html_url":"https://github.com/BurntSushi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2017-12-18T12:11:12Z","label":{"name":"bug","color":"fc2929"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/comments/352409002","html_url":"https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/717#issuecomment-352409002","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/717","id":352409002,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM1MjQwOTAwMg==","user":{"login":"BurntSushi","id":456674,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NjY3NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/456674?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi","html_url":"https://github.com/BurntSushi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-12-18T12:12:01Z","updated_at":"2017-12-18T12:12:15Z","body":"> The easiest 'good enough' alternative that comes to mind would be to do a semi-naïve scan of the pattern that's just smart enough to ignore stuff like short-hand classes\r\n\r\n@okdana If you wanted to do this in the shorter term to get at least some simple cases right, then I'd be in favor of this.

#717 (partially)\r\n\r\nAs suggested, i changed the smart-case feature in the `grep` crate to look for upper-case characters in the pattern itself rather than the AST. I also added some tests for it, and a note in the manual.\r\n\r\nI didn't update the `grep` version number — you don't want me to do that,

case\" is a ripgrep feature that will handle a query as case-sensitive if it contains uppercase characters, and case-insensitive if it doesn't.\r\n\r\nFor example, a document contains\r\n\r\n```\r\nasdf\r\nasdF\r\n```\r\n\r\nWith \"smart case\" enabled, the query `asdf` matches line 1 and line 2. And the query `asdF` only matches line 2.\r\n\r\nIt also works for regular expressions. The regex query `asd\\S` matches line 1 and line 2. The query `asd[A-Z]` only matches line 2.\r\n\r\nWe should introduce a setting, `search.smartCase` or `editor.find.smartCase`. This is easy to hook up for ripgrep, but we also need to implement it for when results are provided by the editor, and for when ripgrep is not used. This is easy for non-regex queries. For regex queries, ripgrep previously attempted to tell whether the regex would match any uppercase characters. But this had unintended consequences, like `\\w` triggering case-sensitivity, so now it only checks whether the regex text has any unescaped uppercase characters (https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/717).
