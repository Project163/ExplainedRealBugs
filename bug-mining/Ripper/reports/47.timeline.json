There are two issues:\n1. Firstly, it's an additional file to stat for in _every_ directory we descend. That list of files is currently at two (`.rgignore` and `.gitignore`), and I know we'd like to bump it to three so we can include `.hgignore` too. Adding `$GIT_DIR/info/exclude` would bring this list to 4 entries. Owch.\n2. A `$GIT_DIR/info/exclude` file seems to have precedence strictly lower than _all_ .gitignore files in the current directory all the way up to the parent directory. (See `man gitignore`). This means we need to: 1) Check all `.gitignore` files, 2) then check all `$GIT_DIR/info/exclude` files and finally 3) check the global gitignore config.\n\nWe should at least support `core.excludesFile`. Supporting `$GIT_DIR/info/exclude` seems like it might cost us too much for little gain. (My impression is that it isn't widely used.)\n","author_association":"OWNER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/comments/248880740/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"BurntSushi","id":456674,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NjY3NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/456674?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi","html_url":"https://github.com/BurntSushi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/comments/249351153","html_url":"https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/9#issuecomment-249351153","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/9","id":249351153,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI0OTM1MTE1Mw==","user":{"login":"Deewiant","id":445326,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0NTMyNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/445326?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Deewiant","html_url":"https://github.com/Deewiant","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Deewiant/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Deewiant/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Deewiant/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Deewiant/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Deewiant/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Deewiant/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Deewiant/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Deewiant/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Deewiant/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-09-24T07:41:58Z","updated_at":"2016-09-24T07:41:58Z","body":"My 2¢: I've used `$GIT_DIR/info/exclude` in practically every repo I've worked on for a significant period of time, whereas I've never used `core.excludesFile`, so for me the priorities there would be exactly reversed.\n\nOne alternative solution might be to have a parameter or separate tool to auto-generate one or more `.ignore` files based on these sources that are otherwise trickier to handle.

PR introduces a new sub-crate, `ignore`, which primarily provides a\nfast recursive directory iterator that respects ignore files like\ngitignore and other configurable filtering rules based on globs or even\nfile types.\n\nThis results in a substantial source of complexity moved out of ripgrep's\ncore and into a reusable component that others can now (hopefully)\nbenefit from.\n\nWhile much of the ignore code carried over from ripgrep's core, a\nsubstantial portion of it was rewritten with the following goals in\nmind:\n1. Reuse matchers build from gitignore files across directory iteration.\n2. Design the matcher data structure to be amenable for parallelizing\n   directory iteration. (Indeed, writing the parallel iterator is the\n   next step.)\n\nFixes #9, #44,

What version of ripgrep are you using?\r\n```\r\nripgrep 13.0.0\r\n-SIMD -AVX (compiled)\r\n+SIMD +AVX (runtime)\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### How did you install ripgrep?\r\n\r\n`brew`\r\n\r\n#### What operating system are you using ripgrep on?\r\n\r\nmacOS Ventura 13.1\r\n\r\n#### Describe your bug.\r\n\r\nI have some local backup files in my dev repo and I'd like to ignore them from all `rg` functionalities. Since they exist on my local machine I don't add them to the repo tracked .gitignore, so I configured a global gitignore but it seems to not work. https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/9 seems to create support for it, but it's quite old already so perhaps it's now broken.\r\n\r\n#### What are the steps to reproduce the behavior?\r\n\r\n```sh\r\n$ git config core.excludesFile\r\n~/.gitignore\r\n\r\n$ cat ~/.gitignore\r\n*.sql\r\n\r\n$ rg --files | rg backup\r\nbackup\r\nbackup_21_07_2022.sql\r\nbackup_11-12-22.sql\r\ndb_backup.sql\r\n\r\n$ git add db_backup.sql\r\nThe following paths are ignored by one of your .gitignore files:\r\ndb_backup.sql\r\nhint: Use -f if you really want to add them.\r\nhint: Turn this message off by running\r\nhint: \"git config advice.addIgnoredFile false\"\r\n\r\n$ echo \"*.sql\" >> .gitignore\r\n\r\n$ rg --files | rg backup\r\nbackup\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou can see that git refuses to add the file since it is ignored by the global .gitignore and then that ripgrep would only respect it if is present in the working directory.\r\n\r\n#### What is the actual behavior?\r\nPatterns from global .gitignore are ignored by ripgrep\r\n\r\n#### What is the expected behavior?\r\nPatterns from global .gitignore are respected by ripgrep\r\n\r\n#### What do you think ripgrep should have done?\r\nIgnore the patterns present in the global .gitignore","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/2392/reactions","total_count":4,"+1":4,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/2392/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
