It is meant to speed up installing new cargo tools.\r\n\r\nBy default, `cargo-binstall` will look for GitHub releases artifacts, and `ripgrep` has these. Unfortunately, `cargo-generate` requires the version component to conform to `v.*` pattern, and `ripgrep` doesn't include the `v`.\r\n\r\nThe easiest way to achieve the desired result would be to override this default by adding this to `Cargo.toml`:\r\n```\r\n[package.metadata.binstall]\r\npkg-url = \"{ repo }/releases/download/{ version }/{ name }-{ target }-v{ version }.{ archive-format }\"\r\n```\r\n(notice the lack of `v` in the version component)\r\n\r\nIf support for `cargo-binstall` is deemed preferable, I'd be happy to land such PR and test that this solution works.\r\n\r\n#### Alternative\r\n\r\nAn alternative would be to change the naming conventions for the releases, but I think the above solution is more surgical and less interfering.","closed_by":{"login":"BurntSushi","id":456674,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NjY3NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/456674?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi","html_url":"https://github.com/BurntSushi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/2298/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/2298/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
