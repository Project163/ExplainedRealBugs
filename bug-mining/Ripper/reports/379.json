I can imagine two different implementations: in the first one path simply sorted as strings. This is what you get when you run `LC_ALL=C sort`. So we get this order:\r\n```text\r\na+\r\na/a\r\na0\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe second way is to threat `/` specially. This gives the following order:\r\n```text\r\na/a\r\na+\r\na0\r\n```\r\n\r\nMy experiments show that `rg --sort=path` uses second way.
