Currently this needs two calls of rg. If `--replace` supported something like `$1:$LINE`, I could just run a `cut -d: -f1` and `cut -d: -f2-1` to get the data, with just one rg call. This should perform better if there are lots of non-matching lines? ... Anyways I think it's a good feature to have.\r\n\r\nPerhaps a better option is to add `--exec` that execs a command?
