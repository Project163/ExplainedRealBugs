It should be possible to write colorized output to standard error, as well as standard output.\r\n\r\nThe pull request above took the tack of adding some helpers that are generic over the two types `io::Stdout` and `io::Stderr`, but @BurntSushi does not like that approach. I took that approach to avoid having to duplicate code between the two cases. I think that @BurntSushi's suggestion of using macros is probably the best alternative.\r\n\r\nI still think that it would be nice for crate users to be able to abstract between stdout and stderr more easily, though. Perhaps involving something like:\r\n\r\n```\r\npub enum StandardStreamType { Stdout, Stderr };\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut the key struct in `termcolor` is named `Stdout`, so it would be tricky to something that added genericity in this way that also maintained compatibility with existing code.","closed_by":{"login":"BurntSushi","id":456674,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NjY3NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/456674?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi","html_url":"https://github.com/BurntSushi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/324/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/324/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
