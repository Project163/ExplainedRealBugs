In delta we're using [`resolve_binary`](https://docs.rs/grep-cli/latest/grep_cli/fn.resolve_binary.html), and I have a question / feature request regarding its API (which I'm opening as a feature request issue). The second sentence of the docstring says `\"If the program could not be resolved, then an error is returned.\"`, whereas in fact this is only true on Windows, as the last sentence says. This has caused me and others to make mistakes. My question is\r\n\r\n- Would a name like `resolve_windows_binary` have been a clearer name, or was there a reason not to do that?\r\n\r\nAnd my feature request\r\n\r\n- Assuming a breaking renaming change is not reasonable, how about moving the final sentence of the docstring (`\"On non-Windows, this is a no-op.\"`) up so that it becomes part of the first sentence of the docstring?","closed_by":{"login":"BurntSushi","id":456674,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NjY3NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/456674?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi","html_url":"https://github.com/BurntSushi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/2928/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/2928/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
