Please describe.**\r\n\r\nWhen downloading binaries from a GitHub releases page, or downloads/release pages in general, it would be beneficial to have something of a checksums file available for reference.\r\n\r\nExamples:\r\n- GitHub CLI: https://github.com/cli/cli/releases/tag/v1.9.2\r\n- GitLab CLI: https://github.com/profclems/glab/releases/tag/v1.16.0\r\n\r\nBoth have a `*.txt` file for referencing hashes, such as `checksums.txt` or other naming convention.\r\n\r\nThis is a good idea in order to verify the integrity of a downloaded binary.\r\n\r\nExamples:\r\n- https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/how-to-verify-ubuntu#1-overview\r\n- https://docs.hak5.org/hc/en-us/articles/360049922674-How-to-verify-the-SHA256-checksum-of-a-downloaded-file\r\n\r\n> \"...it is definitely reassuring to be able to verify that the image [or artifact] you have downloaded is not corrupted in some way, and also that it is an authentic image [or artifact] that hasn’t been tampered with.\"\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\n\r\nA release page should have a `*.txt` file for checksums of release artifacts, in the format similar to the GitHub and GitLab CLI checksum files I provided.\r\n\r\nI use [`salt`](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/) to install packages like `ripgrep`, and by default they support checksum validation by referencing the file examples given above for GitLab/GitHub CLI downloads. :)","closed_by":{"login":"BurntSushi","id":456674,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NjY3NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/456674?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi","html_url":"https://github.com/BurntSushi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/1924/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/1924/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
