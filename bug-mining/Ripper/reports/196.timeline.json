but this bug report isn't something I can understand. Please reproduce the problem outside emacs. Another problem with this bug report is that I have no idea what it is you are trying to do. Another problem is that you say that grep works, but you actually seem to be invoking something else, namely, `rgrep`.

Namely, when no paths are given to ripgrep, then it must guess at what you want. If it looks like there is something on stdin, then it will search stdin. Otherwise, it searches the current working directory.\r\n\r\nYes, it seems that, basically, when `rg` thinks it's outputting to a pipe, and there is no specified directory to search, it doesn't do any searching (calling with `--debug` does give debug output, but no searching happens, and the program blocks).\r\n\r\nHowever, `grep` doesn't work this way: when it's called with output to a pipe but no data on STDIN, it searches for files, just as it does when called with output to a tty.\r\n\r\nMaybe this is the intended behavior, that when `rg` is called with STDOUT going to a pipe, it expects to search STDIN rather than files.  However, I'm not sure if this is documented, e.g.:\r\n```sh\r\nrg --help\r\n...\r\n    rg [OPTIONS] PATTERN [PATH ...]\r\n    rg [OPTIONS] [-e PATTERN ...] [-f FILE ...] [PATH ...]\r\n    rg [OPTIONS] --files [PATH ...]\r\n    rg [OPTIONS] --type-list\r\n```\r\nThe only mention of STDIN is:\r\n```\r\n        --no-filename                       \r\n            Never print the file path with the matched lines. This is the default when\r\n            ripgrep is explicitly instructed to search one file or stdin.\r\n```\r\nSo I guess that either this needs to be documented clearly, or the behavior needs to be improved to search for files unless data is received on STDIN.  For parity with `grep`, I suppose the latter is better.\r\n\r\n> ag should not be used as a model of correctness. It has so many bugs that it sometimes only does the \"right\" thing accidentally.

Thus, ripgrep must guess at what you want. `grep -r` does not do any such thing, because `-r` always makes it do recursive search. It ignores what's on stdin. Example:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ grep -Hr a /tmp/elsewhere\r\n/tmp/elsewhere:a\r\n$ grep -Hr a ./in-current-dir\r\n./in-current-dir:a\r\n$ grep -Hr a\r\nin-current-dir:a\r\n$ cat /tmp/elsewhere | grep -Hr a\r\nin-current-dir:a\r\n```\r\n\r\nThus, there is no such thing as \"parity\" in this case. **This is one of the fundamental differences between ripgrep and grep.**\r\n\r\nNote that I still don't know what it is you're trying to achieve.

Namely, ripgrep will block to search on stdin when no paths are given **and** stdin is not a tty **and** stdin is either a file or a fifo. In all other cases, it searches the current working directory. When you connect a pipe to it, my guess is that ripgrep probably sees that as a fifo and blocks.\r\n\r\n> Indeed, I looked at ag's code and repo, and it definitely has some issues regarding option handling.\r\n\r\nThe only difference that I can see between ag and ripgrep on this particular issue is that ripgrep checks if stdin is a tty or not. If it's a tty, then it always does recursive search. The corollary to that is that the only way for ripgrep to search stdin is if its stdin is _not_ a tty. ag has no such check. All it does is check if stdin is a file or a fifo (which ripgrep also does):\r\n\r\n```c\r\n    rv = fstat(fileno(stdin), &statbuf);\r\n    if (rv == 0) {\r\n        if (S_ISFIFO(statbuf.st_mode) || S_ISREG(statbuf.st_mode)) {\r\n            opts.search_stream = 1;\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\nThat ag doesn't block is actually interesting, because in order for ripgrep to search stdin, it must detect stdin as either a file or a fifo. That should cause ag to also attempt to search stdin. So probably something else is going on, but diving into emacs is beyond the scope of what I'm willing to debug.\r\n\r\n> So I guess that either this needs to be documented clearly\r\n\r\nIt might be worth a mention in the docs, but ripgrep's default behavior is pretty much what you'd expect it to do.

I think it was actually an accident that I originally ran `rgrep` in that example rather than `grep`--I think I was trying to turn `rg` into `grep` and I overlooked the `r` at the beginning of the word.  Silly mistakes...  :/\r\n\r\n> Note that I still don't know what it is you're trying to achieve. Why are you connecting a pipe to your process when you don't want to send anything on stdin?\r\n\r\nBecause Emacs' process code works much better when it uses a pipe rather than emulating a tty.  Chris Wellons explains the details in his blog: http://nullprogram.com/blog/2018/01/17/  It's very interesting how he used DTrace to figure out what was going on between `curl` and Emacs.\r\n\r\n> It might be worth a mention in the docs, but ripgrep's default behavior is pretty much what you'd expect it to do. If you don't give it a path, then it searches CWD, unless you're piping something into it, in which case, it searches that data instead.\r\n\r\nIn this case, the problem was indeed that I misunderstood `rg`'s behavior and expectation of receiving data on STDIN.  It would be very helpful if this were explained in the docs.  As a first step, may I suggest changing the command examples to:\r\n```\r\n    rg [OPTIONS] PATTERN [PATH ...]\r\n    rg [OPTIONS] [-e PATTERN ...] [-f FILE ...] [PATH ...]\r\n    rg [OPTIONS] --files [PATH ...]\r\n    rg [OPTIONS] --type-list\r\n    command | rg [OPTIONS] PATTERN\r\n```\r\nThat at least shows that connecting a pipe to `rg` implies searching STDIN and is not intended for searching paths.\r\n\r\nThanks.","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/comments/397849300/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"alphapapa","id":601365,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYwMTM2NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/601365?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alphapapa","html_url":"https://github.com/alphapapa","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alphapapa/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alphapapa/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alphapapa/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alphapapa/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alphapapa/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alphapapa/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alphapapa/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alphapapa/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alphapapa/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/comments/397849490","html_url":"https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/951#issuecomment-397849490","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/951","id":397849490,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM5Nzg0OTQ5MA==","user":{"login":"BurntSushi","id":456674,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NjY3NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/456674?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi","html_url":"https://github.com/BurntSushi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-06-17T02:02:59Z","updated_at":"2018-06-17T02:02:59Z","body":"@alphapapa

Describe your feature request\r\n\r\nI would like an option to tell ripgrep, that despite being connected to a pipe, it should not search standard input, so that it will do a normal recursive search.\r\n\r\nDon't know about the name.  ``--no-pipe``, perhaps?\r\n\r\n#### Motivation\r\n\r\nripgrep does not work from within Emacs when used as the grep-command on Windows.  It exits immediately with error code 1, or hangs.\r\nI suspect this is related to issue #951, something to do with stdin being a \"fifo\"?  I'm not sure what that's supposed to mean, from what I can see Emacs is just running a bog standard inferior process - and indeed trying to run ripgrep as a Python subprocess exhibits the same problem, this hangs:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nimport subprocess\r\nsubprocess.check_output(['rg','SomeSearchTerm'])\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut never mind the reason, I would just like an option to fix
