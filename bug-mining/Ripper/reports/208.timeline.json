personally find it useful to be able to scan through man pages alphabetically when i don't know the name of an option or i just want to learn about the tool's feature set. The worst man page i can think of is the one for `rsync`, which like `rg` has a million options, but unlike `rg` there is no immediately discernible order to them in the manual. (Close inspection reveals that they're grouped roughly by functionality — e.g., all of the options related to symlinks and hard links are together — but there are way too many groups and they're not labelled.) Trying to browse through it is a nightmare, it's unreal.\r\n\r\nHonestly, i feel a bit hypocritical even about the grouping in the zsh function, because one of my first complaints about the old one was that the options were arranged in an order that wasn't obvious to me. I fixed that in my first rewrite, but now it's ended up kind of back where it was. (e.g., there's no reason that anyone looking at that function should expect to find `--vimgrep` listed under `p`.) But it's functional, so we'll live with it i guess.\r\n\r\nAnyway... what i'm getting at is that i think grouping them into sections would be an improvement **_if_** their number is kept fairly low. Like if we stuck to maybe five broad categories — 'output options', 'file options', 'pattern options'.... Something like that. I feel like that would accomplish the goal of grouping related functionality together without compromising browsability. Once you start to get loads of categories you have to think about how to order the categories themselves, precisely what names to give them, whether there's overlap amongst them, &c. It's not bad if it's just a handful.","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/comments/414453237/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"okdana","id":122095,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMjA5NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/122095?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/okdana","html_url":"https://github.com/okdana","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/okdana/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/okdana/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/okdana/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/okdana/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/okdana/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/okdana/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/okdana/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/okdana/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/okdana/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/comments/414456676","html_url":"https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/1022#issuecomment-414456676","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/1022","id":414456676,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQxNDQ1NjY3Ng==","user":{"login":"BurntSushi","id":456674,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NjY3NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/456674?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi","html_url":"https://github.com/BurntSushi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-08-20T20:43:58Z","updated_at":"2018-08-20T20:43:58Z","body":"Yeah, I hear ya.
