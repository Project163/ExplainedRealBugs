is currently no \"filter entry\" API in the `ignore` crate.\r\n\r\nMy understanding is that using a `.` prefix on macOS is fairly standard for indicating hidden files. I didn't even know of the existence of a separate attribute.\r\n\r\nI'm not inclined to support this in `ignore` directly. Windows support for this exists principally because the `.` prefix convention isn't really used there, _and_ it's cheap. That is, it requires no additional stat calls, but it looks like macOS would. That's a pretty expensive proposition.\r\n\r\nI think the right path forward here is probably to add some kind of filtering functionality to the walker, possibly by adding a new method on `WalkBuilder` (instead of how the `walkdir` API works).

that's too bad.\r\n\r\nFor the API of `WalkBuilder::filter_entry`, taking a generic predicate would require parametrizing `WalkBuilder` on the type of that predicate. Some options:\r\n\r\n1. Make `WalkBuilder` generic over the type of that predicate, i.e. `WalkBuilder<T>`.\r\n2. Make WalkBuilder::filter_entry` take the concrete type `fn(&DirEntry) -> bool`. (This would work for my purposes, but wouldn't work for others.)\r\n3. Box the predicate.\r\n\r\nI'm leaning towards 2., since it meets my needs and doesn't complicate the types.
