This is _probably_ a bug. For corner cases like these, I've generally deferred to `grep`'s behavior, but this probably should get some careful thought. With that said, just because ripgrep and grep differ, that doesn't mean there's a bug.\r\n\r\nOne thing that is making this a bit harder to make sense of, is that if ripgrep detects that a match can never occur, then it exits immediately. One of those cases, on master right now, is when the number of patterns given to ripgrep is zero. The thinking there is that if you have nothing to search for, then you can't get any results. So, right now, this doesn't check whether `-v` is given or not. Whether `-v` should mean \"match everything\" even when there are no patterns isn't quite clear to me. Do you have a specific use case in mind?\r\n\r\nInterestingly, if I _remove_ the optimization that causes ripgrep to bail early, then an empty pattern file gets compiled to an empty regex, and an [empty regex correctly matches at every position](https://play.rust-lang.org/?version=stable&mode=debug&edition=2018&gist=d80819c8a984c4c07b17fc48123f6c98). So the question here, to me, is how an empty pattern file should be interpreted. Is it a single empty regex? Or is it zero regexes? If it's an empty regex, then `-v` should turn up nothing, but if it's zero regexes, then `-v` should turn up everything. Presumably, the latter is the choice grep made. It is possible to provide a single empty regex (provide a pattern file with a single new line), so it does kind of seem like an empty pattern file should be treated as providing no regexes. In which case, grep's behavior here is probably correct.\r\n\r\nDo you have a particular use case in mind here, or did you just happen to notice a curious inconsistency?","author_association":"OWNER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/comments/515944415/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"BurntSushi","id":456674,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NjY3NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/456674?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi","html_url":"https://github.com/BurntSushi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":2516087337,"node_id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDI1MTYwODczMzc=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/events/2516087337","actor":{"login":"BurntSushi","id":456674,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NjY3NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/456674?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi","html_url":"https://github.com/BurntSushi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-07-29T10:54:15Z","label":{"name":"bug","color":"fc2929"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2516087338,"node_id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDI1MTYwODczMzg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/events/2516087338","actor":{"login":"BurntSushi","id":456674,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NjY3NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/456674?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi","html_url":"https://github.com/BurntSushi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-07-29T10:54:15Z","label":{"name":"question","color":"cc317c"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/comments/515980208","html_url":"https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/1332#issuecomment-515980208","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/1332","id":515980208,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUxNTk4MDIwOA==","user":{"login":"wrodis","id":6649217,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2NDkyMTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6649217?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wrodis","html_url":"https://github.com/wrodis","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wrodis/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wrodis/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wrodis/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wrodis/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wrodis/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wrodis/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wrodis/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wrodis/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wrodis/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":

with `brew bump-formula-pr`.<details>\n  <summary>release notes</summary>\n  <pre>[Sponsorship is appreciated!](https://github.com/sponsors/BurntSushi/)\r\n\r\nripgrep 15 is a new major version release of ripgrep that mostly has bug fixes,\r\nsome minor performance improvements and minor new features.\r\n\r\n> In case you haven't heard of it before, ripgrep is a line-oriented search\r\n> tool that recursively searches the current directory for a regex pattern.\r\n> By default, ripgrep will respect gitignore rules and automatically skip\r\n> hidden files/directories and binary files.\r\n\r\nHere are some highlights:\r\n\r\n* Several bugs around gitignore matching have been fixed. This includes\r\n  a commonly reported bug related to applying gitignore rules from parent\r\n  directories.\r\n* A memory usage regression when handling very large gitignore files has been\r\n  fixed.\r\n* `rg -vf file`, where `file` is empty, now matches everything.\r\n* The `-r/--replace` flag now works with `--json`.\r\n* A subset of Jujutsu (`jj`) repositories are now treated as if they were git\r\n  repositories. That is, ripgrep will respect `jj`'s gitignores.\r\n* Globs can now use nested curly braces.\r\n\r\nPlatform support:\r\n\r\n* `aarch64` for Windows now has release artifacts.\r\n* `powerpc64` no longer has release artifacts generated for it. The CI\r\n  release workflow stopped working, and I didn't deem it worth my time to\r\n  debug it. If someone wants this and can test it, I'd be happy to add it\r\n  back.\r\n* ripgrep binaries are now compiled with full LTO enabled. You may notice\r\n  small performance improvements from this and a modest decrease in binary\r\n  size.\r\n\r\nPerformance improvements:\r\n\r\n* [PERF #2111](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/2111):\r\n  Don't resolve helper binaries on Windows when `-z/--search-zip` isn't used.\r\n* [PERF #2865](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/pull/2865):\r\n  Avoid using path canonicalization on Windows when emitting hyperlinks.\r\n* [PERF #3184](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/pull/3184):\r\n  Improve performance of large values with `-A/--after-context`.\r\n\r\nBug fixes:\r\n\r\n* [BUG
