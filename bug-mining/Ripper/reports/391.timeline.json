yes, I should've been more constructive, sorry for that.\r\n\r\nThe problem is that I failed to find out how to change it, so it's discoverability thing. You see above I tried not-so-relevant flags. I did check tab-completion to `rg --no-<TAB>`. I also checked man page / issues for following keywords:\r\n\r\n- separator\r\n- delimiter\r\n- blank / empty line\r\n- multiline\r\n- multiple (meaning multiple files)\r\n\r\nall until I found this issue and that `a-ha!` moment: blank line belongs to the heading, `--no-heading` flag is what was looked for.\r\n\r\nI think possible solution would be add more info to help / man page.\r\n\r\n> --heading\r\n           This flag prints the file path above clusters of matches from each file instead of printing the file path\r\n           as a prefix for each matched line. This is the default mode when printing to a terminal.\r\n\r\nLike here we don't have any mention that the heading includes that blank line - separator of clusters of matches.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nI would say steps to reproduce the issue are:\r\n\r\n1. I'd like to extract some data from files\r\n2. `rg <pattern>`, check results in the output\r\n3. no need for line numbers -> `--no-line-numbers`, cool\r\n4. don't need filenames -> `--no-filename`, obviously\r\n5. no blank lines, please -> `???`, user is stuck\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nI mostly agree with what @sheisnicola wrote:\r\n\r\n> If filenames and numbers are being suppressed, then the blank line to separate each file has no meaning or context so I would not expect them to be printed.\r\n\r\nIn our use cases `-NI` meant \"hey, `rg`, I don't care about _source / location_ of the data, fetch me just it\" and those blank lines weren't desirable. Guess there can be situations where you don't need this metadata but still want the clustering of matches.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nSo for now `--heading` help / man page can be improved. Maybe some notice of how you control output when searching through multiple files? Otherwise Interactive TAB-completion is usually enough for me to discover ripgerp's options and flags.","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/comments/757787317/reactions","total_count":6,"+1":5,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":1,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"murlakatamenka","id":7361274,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjczNjEyNzQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7361274?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/murlakatamenka","html_url":"https://github.com/murlakatamenka","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/murlakatamenka/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/murlakatamenka/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/murlakatamenka/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/murlakatamenka/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/murlakatamenka/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/murlakatamenka/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/murlakatamenka/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/murlakatamenka/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/murlakatamenka/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":4189687842,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50NDE4OTY4Nzg0Mg==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/events/4189687842","actor":{"login":"sheisnicola","id":68857318,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4ODU3MzE4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/68857318?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sheisnicola","html_url":"https://github.com/sheisnicola","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sheisnicola/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sheisnicola/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sheisnicola/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sheisnicola/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sheisnicola/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sheisnicola/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sheisnicola/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sheisnicola/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sheisnicola/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-01-11T09:25:00Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":4189687844,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDQxODk2ODc4NDQ=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/events/4189687844","actor":{"login":"sheisnicola","id":68857318,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4ODU3MzE4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/68857318?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sheisnicola","html_url":"https://github.com/sheisnicola","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sheisnicola/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sheisnicola/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sheisnicola/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sheisnicola/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sheisnicola/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sheisnicola/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sheisnicola/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sheisnicola/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sheisnicola/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-01-11T09:25:00Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":4190871278,"node_id":"MDE0OlVubGFiZWxlZEV2ZW50NDE5MDg3MTI3OA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/events/4190871278","actor":{"login":"BurntSushi","id":456674,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NjY3NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/456674?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi","html_url":"https://github.com/BurntSushi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"unlabeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-01-11

Line numbers don't seem to be very useful out of context (without a file name).\r\n\r\nThis isn't true. If file names aren't shown, then it's because the file name is unambiguous. That is, only one file was searched. For example:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ rg WARRANTY UNLICENSE LICENSE-MIT\r\nLICENSE-MIT\r\n15:THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\r\n\r\nUNLICENSE\r\n16:THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,\r\n\r\n$ rg WARRANTY UNLICENSE\r\n16:THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,\r\n```\r\n\r\n> I guess what I really expected is for `-I` to be the equivalent of `--no-filename --no-line-number --no-heading`, but I suppose this would be too big of a change now. Anyway, having one convenient option for this would have been nice.\r\n\r\nIndeed, too big of a change and not one that makes sense to me personally. I'm not even sure what such an option would be called. I'd suggest creating an alias or a wrapper script for it.\r\n\r\n> > Or at least, if this bug were fixed, having that gap would be impossible.\r\n> \r\n> Wouldn't the `--heading` option enable this?\r\n\r\nNo? The issue here is precisely that the gap exists when `--heading` is set. And `--heading` is set by default when printing to a tty.\r\n\r\nIn fact, when doing a recursive search, both `--heading` and `--line-number` are _only_ set when printing to a tty. That's because ripgrep is assuming that when printing to a tty, you want to see \"human friendly\" output. But you can squash that pretty easily by piping the output of ripgrep into `cat`. For example, the following two commands are equivalent:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ rg -IN --no-filename --color never host /etc\r\n```\r\n\r\nand\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ rg -I host /etc | cat\r\n```\r\n\r\nBecause when you aren't printing to a tty, ripgrep simply doesn't enable `--heading`, `--line-number` or `--color auto`. This matches grep's behavior when not printing to a tty. The only difference between ripgrep and grep here is that grep doesn't take as many liberties with the output when printing to a tty.\r\n\r\nGiven that I still feel the same way that I did back when I first looked at this issue, I don't think I'm going to take any action here. So I'm going to close this.","author_association":"OWNER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/comments/1216990735/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"BurntSushi","id":456674,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NjY3NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/456674?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi","html_url":"https://github.com/BurntSushi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":7199489689,"node_id":"CE_lADOAzJbyc4rLyJmzwAAAAGtH36Z","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/events/7199489689","actor":{"login":"BurntSushi","id":456674,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NjY3NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/456674?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi","html_url":"https://github.com/BurntSushi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-08-16T18:20:12Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":7199491499,"node_id":"CE_lADOAzJbyc4rLyJmzwAAAAGtH4Wr","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/events/7199491499","actor":{"login":"BurntSushi","id":456674,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NjY3NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/456674?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi","html_url":"https://github.com/BurntSushi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-08-16T18:20:25Z","state_reason":"not_planned","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/comments/1216991515","html_url":"https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/1709#issuecomment-1216991515","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/1709","id":1216991515,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAzJbyc5IidEb","user":{"login":"BurntSushi","id":456674,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NjY3NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/456674?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi","html_url":"https://github.com/BurntSushi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":fa
