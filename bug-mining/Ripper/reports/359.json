In some cases involving large files, time and IO can be saved by stopping the search after having matched such a run of consecutive lines.\r\n\r\nI'm fairly convinced this feature can save countless CPU cycles and IO in big-ish data situations, particularly where timestamp matching is involved.\r\n\r\n### Example\r\n\r\nInput:\r\n```\r\n2021-01-29T07:08:09+0100 foo\r\n2021-01-29T08:08:09+0100 bar\r\n2021-01-29T09:08:09+0100 baz\r\n2021-01-29T10:08:09+0100 boz\r\n```\r\n\r\nBehaviour when searching for pattern `^2021-01-29T08` with this option enabled:\r\n\r\n1. First line does not match; continue to next.\r\n2. Second line matches; print it and continue to next.\r\n3. Third line does not match; break and exit; line 4 is never scanned.\r\n\r\n### Pseudo code\r\n\r\n```\r\nhave_seen_matches = null\r\nfor each line:\r\n  if line matches:\r\n    print line\r\n    have_seen_matches = true\r\n  else:\r\n    if have_seen_matches == true:\r\n      break\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Suggested documentation\r\n```\r\n--stop-on-nonmatch\r\n    Stop reading a file on the first non-matching line that follows a matching\r\n    line. At least one line must have matched for this to take effect.\r\n```","closed_by":{"login":"BurntSushi","id":456674,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NjY3NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/456674?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi","html_url":"https://github.com/BurntSushi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/1790/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/1790/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
