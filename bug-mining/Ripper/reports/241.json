The same bug can be reproduced with `rg --files`.\r\n\r\n#### If this is a bug, what are the steps to reproduce the behavior?\r\n\r\n1. Make sure that there are no zombie processes on your system (`ps -ef | rg '<defunct>'`)\r\n\r\n2. Run `rg --files > /dev/null 2>&1` inside `/proc`. Everything should work fine (process exits after a few seconds).\r\n\r\n3. Create a zombie process on purpose\r\n    a. Copy the code from https://stackoverflow.com/a/25228579/704831 into a file called `zombie.c`\r\n    b. Compile it `gcc -o zombie zombie.c`\r\n    c. Run it: `./zombie`\r\n\r\n4. Run `rg --files > /dev/null 2>&1` inside `/proc` again. This seems to hang indefinitely.\r\n\r\n5. Get the PID of the zombie process via `ps -ef | rg '<defunct>'`. Call it `$PID`.\r\n\r\n6. Run `rg --glob \"\\!$PID\" --files > /dev/null 2>&1`. This should work fine, indicating that the directory traversal hangs in `/proc/$PID`.\r\n\r\n#### If this is a bug, what is the actual behavior?\r\n\r\n`rg --files` hangs indefinitely inside the `/proc` folder.\r\n\r\n#### If this is a bug, what is the expected behavior?\r\n\r\n`rg --files` traverses the `/proc` folder in finite time.\r\n\r\nNote: `find`, for example, does not seem to have this problem and finishes in finite time even in the presence of zombie processes.","closed_by":{"login":"BurntSushi","id":456674,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NjY3NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/456674?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi","html_url":"https://github.com/BurntSushi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/916/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/916/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
