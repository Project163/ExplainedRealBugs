Line numbers are typically what you want when browsing search results, but if you want to filter a file by content, then you probably don't want line numbers. The \"atty\" detection is meant to display human readable output. But as soon as you pipe it, ripgrep can't make any reasonable assumptions about what you want to do with the output, so it therefore does the safest most conservative thing possible: *do what grep does*.\r\n\r\nI personally think making line numbers the default is off the table. I also think it's completely orthogonal to your specific issue here.\r\n\r\nHaving `--column` imply `--line-number` seems more likely. Your point is one I really hadn't considered. It does seem a bit tenuous to claim that `--column` is useful without `--line-number`. Certainly, I agree that it's useless if you're trying to use it in an automated process that's reading ripgrep's output. Maybe an end user wants the column number for some reason?\r\n\r\nI'll noodle on it and see if I can come up with a better objection, but as of now, I think I'm on board.

Considering that a level of compatibility with grep is desired\r\n\r\nJust to nitpick on this (sorry for being a pedant!), I don't think it's necessarily the case the *compatibility* with grep itself is the goal, but that I do think it's the right default if one wants to use ripgrep in similar use cases as grep. For example, an operation like \"I want file X, except only give me lines matching foo,\" is really common in pipelines. If ripgrep defaulted to showing line numbers, that wouldn't really work right, and would lead to surprising behavior for folks accustomed to grep.\r\n\r\nThere are also a lot of flags in ripgrep named specifically to match up with grep. This isn't so much because strict compatibility is desired, but that it's better to not introduce our own names for the same/similar operation.\r\n\r\n(I'm only pointing this out because it's useful to have shared values on these things for future decisions.)","author_association":"OWNER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/comments/262067618/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"BurntSushi","id":456674,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NjY3NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/456674?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi","html_url":"https://github.com/BurntSushi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/comments/262069408","html_url":"https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/243#issuecomment-262069408","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/243","id":262069408,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2MjA2OTQwOA==","user":{"login":"BurntSushi","id":456674,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NjY3NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/456674?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi","html_url":"https://github.com/BurntSushi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-11-21T21:15:33Z","updated_at":"2016-11-21T21:15:33Z","body":"> Off topic, and perhaps the semver movement has lulled me into a false sense of security, but why not simply adopt semver instead of relying on grepping or [meta] ripgrepping the changelog of each release for \"breaking\"?\r\n\r\nWhat makes you think ripgrep *doesn't* use semver? :P In fact, it does! Note that strictly speaking, in semver, pre-1.0 is \"anything goes.\" I would be within semver, for example, to do a breaking change in a `0.3.1` release.\r\n\r\nHowever, in the Rust ecosystem, we have adopted a *convention* (that Cargo knows about) that when a crate is pre-1.0, it should only introduce breaking changes in a *minor* release, so that patch releases shouldn't have breaking changes.\r\n\r\nWith all that said, just because we follow semver doesn't mean I want to rapidly produce breaking changes. I would rather be methodical about it and still try to bias against it where it makes sense. For example, once we hit 1.0, I'd like there to be a very strong bias against breaking changes. It would be so strong that I'd probably throw a suggestion like this out the window on that principle alone if we were post-1.0.\r\n\r\nSemver says it's OK to make the breaking change so long as I release ripgrep 2. But if we do too much of that, people will get annoyed.\r\n\r\n> Is there some 1.0 milestone that just hasn't been reached yet or just a historical phobia of linux libs fearing numbers > 0?\r\n\r\nI'm not sure if you meant or not, but \"phobia\" implies it's an *irrational fear*, and I don't think there's anything irrational about not wanting to break stuff.\r\n\r\nWith respect to a 1.0 milestone... No, no such milestone exists. There are still some big things I'd want to do before even considering it:\r\n\r\n1. Finish libripgrep.\r\n2. Experiment and probably add support for additional text encodings.\r\n3. Experiment and possibly add fulltext search (see #95).\r\n\r\n1+2 might get rolled into one thing and 3 is a pretty giant can-of-worms, but its risk/reward ratio is quite tempting.","author_association":"OWNER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/comments/262069408/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"BurntSushi","id":456674,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NjY3NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/456674?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi","html_url":"https://github.com/BurntSushi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/comments/262080807","html_url":"https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/243#issuecomment-262080807","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/243","id":262080807,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2MjA4MDgwNw==","user":{"login":"leeoniya","id":43234,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzMjM0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/43234?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/leeoniya","html_url":"https://github.com/leeoniya","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leeoniya/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leeoniya/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leeoniya/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leeoniya/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leeoniya/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leeoniya/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leeoniya/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leeoniya/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leeoniya/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-11-21T21:59:09Z","updated_at":"2016-11-21T21:59:09Z","body":"> I'm not sure if you meant or not, but \"phobia\" implies it's an irrational fear, and I don't think there's anything irrational about not wanting to break stuff.\r\n\r\nPhobia of version numbers > 0.
