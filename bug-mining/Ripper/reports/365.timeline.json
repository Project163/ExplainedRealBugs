following the issue template because this isn't an issue. \r\n\r\nI switched to Linux from macOS. On macOS I used iterm2 which automatically handled file links, Ripgrep would list a file out such as `src/subdirectory/subdirectory/filename.json` and if you alt+clicked that directory+filename listing, it'd open your editor.

following things seem to be needed for supporting hyperlinked file paths in ripgrep. I'm just writing for no reason, maybe it's useful.\r\n\r\n- Resolve paths to absolute paths (I would suggest do so without touching the filesystem, don't want canonicalization) and url escape paths to be printable-ascii-safe as `file://` URIs.\r\n- Lookup current hostname (bonus feature but should preferably be in the URL according to the spec, this seems to be a bit of a layer-busting complication)\r\n- Add cli parameter --hyperlink={always|ansi|auto|never}  (I don't know if ansi is useful here, but I think so)\r\n- Use the hyperlink escapes in the printer crate. I'm not sure if it's a great fit to try to put it inside termcolor - even if the spec says it works very similarly to colors.\r\n\r\nThis feature is supported with the same escape code in Linux (various terminals including gnome-terminal), Windows (microsoft/terminal), macos (iTerm2). The pager less supports it in new versions.","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/comments/840648276/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"bluss","id":3209739,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyMDk3Mzk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3209739?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluss","html_url":"https://github.com/bluss","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluss/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluss/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluss/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluss/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluss/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluss/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluss/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluss/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluss/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/comments/840735760","html_url":"https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/665#issuecomment-840735760","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/665","id":840735760,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDg0MDczNTc2MA==","user":{"login":"BurntSushi","id":456674,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NjY3NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/456674?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi","html_url":"https://github.com/BurntSushi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-05-13T18:08:53Z","updated_at":"2021-05-13T18:08:53Z","body":"@bluss Thanks for laying that out! Some quick feedback:\r\n\r\n* If possible, I'd like to avoid the hostname lookup aspect of this. You're spot on about it being layer busting. I think the key thing here is, what does the hostname buy us? i.e., What do we lose if we don't bother with it.\r\n* Putting this inside of termcolor might be nice to be honest, especially if it's an ANSI escape sequence. Or at least, putting the _emission_ of that ANSI escape inside termcolor would be good. Having it be outside of termcolor would probably be more problematic.\r\n* When supporting the legacy Windows console, I think we would just not emit the escape sequence, like we do now for things not supported by the Windows console.\r\n\r\nI think that's all I can think of for right now.
