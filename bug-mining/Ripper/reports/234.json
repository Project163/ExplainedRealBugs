The reason for me is that I have two main uses for `rg`. \r\n1. Searching files for content.\r\n2. Very quickly creating a list of all files in the current directory that I might want to open. I pass the output of `rg --files --hidden --ignore-file ~/.vim/fzf_ignore` to to FZF in vim. This allows me to fuzzy search all the file names in the current repo that are not ignored by git. `~/.vim/fzf_ignore` contains a file with stuff like `.git/` and `.svn/`.\r\n\r\nThe problem I keep running into is that I add some files to the .ignore file that I don't want to search. But then I also cannot open them with the fuzzy search anymore. The reason I add them to .ignore is because they are big files that will often match my search, such as csv files, a dev database dump or a vendored minified js file. \r\n\r\nThe addition of a `--no-ignore-dot-ignore` flag would solve this problem for me.","closed_by":{"login":"BurntSushi","id":456674,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NjY3NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/456674?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi","html_url":"https://github.com/BurntSushi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/1138/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/1138/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
