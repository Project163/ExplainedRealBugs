Checks\n\n- [x] I have read the troubleshooting section and still think this is a bug.\n\n### Describe the bug you encountered:\n\nHello.\nI'm on Archlinux, using fd 10.2.0 and zsh.\n\nIf a directory's name ends with .(dot), and if the directory is being excluded by `--exclude`, `fd` does not do the job.\nFor example,\n```\n$ ls -l\ndrwxr-xr-x 1 nemo nemo 1.2K 2025-02-01 22:41  abcfoobar.\ndrwxr-xr-x 1 nemo nemo 1.2K 2025-02-01 22:44  abcfoobarzoo\ndrwxr-xr-x 1 nemo nemo  184 2025-02-01 23:18  xyzbarfoo\n.... (many other dirs...)\n```\nI have a directory named `abcfoobar.`, `abcfoobarzoo`, and `xyzbarfoo`.\n\n```\n$ fd --exclude=abcfoobar. --exclude=xyzbarfoo | rg 'abcfoobar|xyzbarfoo'\n1:1:abcfoobarzoo/\n2:1:abcfoobar./\n3:1:abcfoobar./fd_file_practice_deleteit\n4:1:abcfoobar./2-chrome-kjbdgfilnfhdoflbpgamdcdgpehopbep-Default.desktop\n5:1:abcfoobar./2-chrome-kdhdkmeileofnlbnpndjkbgiemlhgmmd-Default.desktop\n6:1:abcfoobar./2-chrome-jgcngmnmmbofobnpbddpeedpiaiogpdh-Default.desktop\n7:1:abcfoobar./2-chrome-famcjndkpfkjbdmdjokfbokncecponlc-Default.desktop\n8:1:abcfoobar./2-chrome-eilembjdkfgodjkcjnpgpaenohkicgjd-Default.desktop\n9:1:abcfoobar./2-chrome-cgjkcjhllhgpdlnpdlfoollgddkoopgn-Default.desktop\n10:1:abcfoobar./2-chrome-agimnkijcaahngcdmfeangaknmldooml-Default.desktop\n11:1:abcfoobar./2-chrome-abhlffefmlmfknmhmpkbnekffhfphmjn-Default.desktop\n12:1:abcfoobar./2-albert-windows-rule3.kwinrule\n13:1:abcfoobar./2-albert-windows-rule2.kwinrule\n14:1:abcfoobar./2-albert-windows-rule.kwinrule\n```\nTo make it work, I have to try something else.\n```\n$ fd --exclude='abcfoobar.*' --exclude=xyzbarfoo | rg 'abcfoobar|xyzbarfoo'\n1:1:abcfoobarzoo/\n```\n'abcfoobar.*' is **not regex**, because it does not exclude 'abcfoobarzoo'.\n\n***\nIs is as intended?\nIf so, please describe this on the [README](https://github.com/sharkdp/fd?tab=readme-ov-file#excluding-specific-files-or-directories).\nAlso, on the README, the example is not a good one.\n```\n> fd -E /mnt/external-drive …\n```\nHowever, `--exclude` is relative to the starting directory, [said](https://github.com/tavianator) @tavianator.\nThis also has to be mentioned on the README.\n\n\n### Describe what you expected to happen:\n\n_No response_\n\n### What version of `fd` are you using?\n\n10.2.0\n\n### Which operating system / distribution are you on?\n\n```shell\nLinux 6.12.10-arch1-1 x86_64\nArchlinux, KDE Plasma6, with zsh.\n```","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sharkdp/fd/issues/1667/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sharkdp/fd/issues/1667/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"actor":{"login":"pi55man","id":173155810,"node_id":"U_kgDOClIl4g","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/173155810?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pi55man","html_url":"https://github.com/pi55man","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pi55man/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pi55man/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pi55man/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pi55man/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pi55man/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pi55man/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pi55man/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pi55man/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pi55man/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-03-29T16:32:29Z","updated_at":"2025-03-29T16:32:29Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/3019","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/3019/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/3019/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/3019/events","html_url":"https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/pull/3019","id":2958219053,"node_id":"PR_kwDOAzJbyc6QqT0O","number":3019,"title":"Fix

PR addresses [issue #2990](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/2990), where `ripgrep` did not properly ignore directories named only with dots (e.g., `.`, `..`, `...`) when using negated glob patterns (`-g '!dir'`).  \r\n\r\nPreviously, the `file_name` function in `globset` only checked if the last byte was a dot (`.`), which led to incorrect behavior. This caused:  \r\n- `rg --files -g '!asdf.'` still listing `asdf./foo`  \r\n- But `rg --files -g '!asdf'` correctly ignoring `asdf/foo`  \r\n\r\n### Fix  \r\nThe function now ensures that entire filenames made only of dots are ignored by using:  \r\n```rust\r\nif path.iter().all(|&b| b == b'.') {\r\n    return None;\r\n}\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/3019/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/3019/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":18026703597,"node_id":"MADE_lADOAzJbyc6qITY4zwAAAAQyeart","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/events/18026703597","actor":{"login":"tjjfvi","id":44031566,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0MDMxNTY2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/44031566?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tjjfvi","html_url":"https://github.com/tjjfvi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tjjfvi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tjjfvi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tjjfvi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tjjfvi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tjjfvi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tjjfvi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tjjfvi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tjjfvi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tjjfvi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"marked_as_duplicate","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2025-06-06T17:54:54Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":19192760869,"node_id":"LE_lADOAzJbyc6qITY4zwAAAAR3-kol","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/events/19192760869","actor":{"login":"BurntSushi","id":456674,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NjY3NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/456674?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi","html_url":"https://github.com/BurntSushi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2025-08-17T21:31:17Z","label":{"name":"bug","color":"fc2929"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":19192760875,"node_id":"LE_lADOAzJbyc6qITY4zwAAAAR3-kor","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/events/19192760875","actor":{"login":"BurntSushi","id":456674,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NjY3NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/456674?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi","html_url":"https://github.com/BurntSushi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2025-08-17T21:31:18Z","label":{"name":"rollup","color":"ffccee"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":19192764043,"node_id":"REFE_lADOAzJbyc6qITY4zwAAAAR3-laL","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/events/19192764043","actor":{"login":"BurntSushi","id":456674,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NjY3NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/456674?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi","html_url":"https://github.com/BurntSushi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/repo

release of ripgrep that mostly has bug fixes,\r\nsome minor performance improvements and minor new features.\r\n\r\n> In case you haven't heard of it before, ripgrep is a line-oriented search\r\n> tool that recursively searches the current directory for a regex pattern.\r\n> By default, ripgrep will respect gitignore rules and automatically skip\r\n> hidden files/directories and binary files.\r\n\r\nHere are some highlights:\r\n\r\n* Several bugs around gitignore matching have been fixed. This includes\r\n  a commonly reported bug related to applying gitignore rules from parent\r\n  directories.\r\n* A memory usage regression when handling very large gitignore files has been\r\n  fixed.\r\n* `rg -vf file`, where `file` is empty, now matches everything.\r\n* The `-r/--replace` flag now works with `--json`.\r\n* A subset of Jujutsu (`jj`) repositories are now treated as if they were git\r\n  repositories. That is, ripgrep will respect `jj`'s gitignores.\r\n* Globs can now use nested curly braces.\r\n\r\nPlatform support:\r\n\r\n* `aarch64` for Windows now has release artifacts.\r\n* `powerpc64` no longer has release artifacts generated for it. The CI\r\n  release workflow stopped working, and I didn't deem it worth my time to\r\n  debug it. If someone wants this and can test it, I'd be happy to add it\r\n  back.\r\n* ripgrep binaries are now compiled with full LTO enabled. You may notice\r\n  small performance improvements from this and a modest decrease in binary\r\n  size.\r\n\r\nPerformance improvements:\r\n\r\n* [PERF #2111](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/2111):\r\n  Don't resolve helper binaries on Windows when `-z/--search-zip` isn't used.\r\n* [PERF
