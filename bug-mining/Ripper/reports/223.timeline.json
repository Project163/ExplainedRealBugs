That's a pretty big hit, but it's already so fast that I personally wouldn't mind it.\r\n\r\nThoughts on including this? If you're interested I can try working on the changes myself - I haven't worked in Rust before but I've been looking for a good opportunity, and just adding a flag to enable this looks like it would be a pretty minor change (famous last words).","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/comments/455829859/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"davidtorosyan","id":46736285,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ2NzM2Mjg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/46736285?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidtorosyan","html_url":"https://github.com/davidtorosyan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidtorosyan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidtorosyan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidtorosyan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidtorosyan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidtorosyan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidtorosyan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidtorosyan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidtorosyan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidtorosyan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/comments/455830176","html_url":"https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/1164#issuecomment-455830176","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/1164","id":455830176,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ1NTgzMDE3Ng==","user":{"login":"BurntSushi","id":456674,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NjY3NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/456674?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi","html_url":"https://github.com/BurntSushi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-01-20T01:43:09Z","updated_at":"2019-01-20T01:43:09Z","body":"Excellent analysis, thank you! Yes, I would be OK adding this behind a flag.\r\n\r\nIn principle, you're right, the change is simple. There is a fair bit of plumbing though. ripgrep is split up into libraries, so features like this need to be part of the public API of a library. For example, I'd probably expect it to be a new option on a [`ignore::WalkBuilder`](https://docs.rs/ignore/0.4.6/ignore/struct.WalkBuilder.html) that in turn set [`ignore::gitignore::GitignoreBuilder::case_insensitive`](https://docs.rs/ignore/0.4.6/ignore/gitignore/struct.GitignoreBuilder.html#method.case_insensitive) appropriately.\r\n\r\nIf you want to give it a try, that'd be great!
