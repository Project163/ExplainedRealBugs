`.*` matching an empty string is almost certainly the issue here, but I'm not sure whether the end result is correct or not. In particular, these examples is interesting:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ printf a | rg '.*' -r '${0}f'\r\naf\r\n$ printf 'a\\n' | rg '.*' -r '${0}f'\r\naf\r\nf\r\n```\r\n\r\nMy guess here is that something about the replacement code is erroneously matching the position immediately after the `\\n`. I say \"erroneous\" here because, logically speaking, grep tools work by matching a line at a time, and that generally doesn't include the line terminator. (Without multiline mode for example, ripgrep literally forbids you from writing a regex that matches a line terminator.)\r\n\r\nMoreover, it is _at least_ inconsistent:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ printf 'a' | rg '.*' --json\r\n{\"type\":\"begin\",\"data\":{\"path\":{\"text\":\"<stdin>\"}}}\r\n{\"type\":\"match\",\"data\":{\"path\":{\"text\":\"<stdin>\"},\"lines\":{\"text\":\"a\"},\"line_number\":1,\"absolute_offset\":0,\"submatches\":[{\"match\":{\"text\":\"a\"},\"start\":0,\"end\":1}]}}\r\n{\"type\":\"end\",\"data\":{\"path\":{\"text\":\"<stdin>\"},\"binary_offset\":null,\"stats\":{\"elapsed\":{\"secs\":0,\"nanos\":123261,\"human\":\"0.000123s\"},\"searches\":1,\"searches_with_match\":1,\"bytes_searched\":1,\"bytes_printed\":217,\"matched_lines\":1,\"matches\":1}}}\r\n{\"data\":{\"elapsed_total\":{\"human\":\"0.006336s\",\"nanos\":6335770,\"secs\":0},\"stats\":{\"bytes_printed\":217,\"bytes_searched\":1,\"elapsed\":{\"human\":\"0.000123s\",\"nanos\":123261,\"secs\":0},\"matched_lines\":1,\"matches\":1,\"searches\":1,\"searches_with_match\":1}},\"type\":\"summary\"}\r\n\r\n$ printf 'a\\n' | rg '.*' --json\r\n{\"type\":\"begin\",\"data\":{\"path\":{\"text\":\"<stdin>\"}}}\r\n{\"type\":\"match\",\"data\":{\"path\":{\"text\":\"<stdin>\"},\"lines\":{\"text\":\"a\\n\"},\"line_number\":1,\"absolute_offset\":0,\"submatches\":[{\"match\":{\"text\":\"a\"},\"start\":0,\"end\":1}]}}\r\n{\"type\":\"end\",\"data\":{\"path\":{\"text\":\"<stdin>\"},\"binary_offset\":null,\"stats\":{\"elapsed\":{\"secs\":0,\"nanos\":165502,\"human\":\"0.000166s\"},\"searches\":1,\"searches_with_match\":1,\"bytes_searched\":2,\"bytes_printed\":219,\"matched_lines\":1,\"matches\":1}}}\r\n{\"data\":{\"elapsed_total\":{\"human\":\"0.005240s\",\"nanos\":5240405,\"secs\":0},\"stats\":{\"bytes_printed\":219,\"bytes_searched\":2,\"elapsed\":{\"human\":\"0.000166s\",\"nanos\":165502,\"secs\":0},\"matched_lines\":1,\"matches\":1,\"searches\":1,\"searches_with_match\":1}},\"type\":\"summary\"}\r\n```\r\n\r\nNotice how the second search reports exactly one match. Which is inconsistent with the fact that the replacement behaves as if there are two matches.

wrong.","author_association":"OWNER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/comments/734357500/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"BurntSushi","id":456674,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NjY3NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/456674?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi","html_url":"https://github.com/BurntSushi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/comments/734631017","html_url":"https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/1739#issuecomment-734631017","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/1739","id":734631017,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDczNDYzMTAxNw==","user":{"login":"learnbyexample","id":17766317,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NzY2MzE3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17766317?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/learnbyexample","html_url":"https://github.com/learnbyexample","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/learnbyexample/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/learnbyexample/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/learnbyexample/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/learnbyexample/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/learnbyexample/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/learnbyexample/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/learnbyexample/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/learnbyexample/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/learnbyexample/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-11-27T03:49:12Z","updated_at":"2020-11-27T03:49:12Z","body":">Moreover,

What version of ripgrep are you using?\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n$ rg --version\r\nripgrep 11.0.1 (rev 1f1cd9b467)\r\n-SIMD -AVX (compiled)\r\n+SIMD -AVX (runtime)\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### How did you install ripgrep?\r\n\r\nUsing https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/releases/download/11.0.1/ripgrep_11.0.1_amd64.deb\r\n\r\n#### What operating system are you using ripgrep on?\r\n\r\nUbuntu 16.04.1\r\n\r\n#### Describe your question, feature request, or bug.\r\n\r\nFrom https://docs.rs/regex/1.1.6/regex/#syntax\r\n\r\n>Note that ^ matches after new lines, even at the end of input:\r\n\r\nand I'm guessing this applies to `$` anchor as well\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n$ printf 'one\\ntwo\\nthree\\n' | rg '^' -r '* '\r\n* one\r\n* \r\n* two\r\n* \r\n* three\r\n* \r\n\r\n$ printf 'one\\ntwo\\nthree\\n' | rg '$' -r ' ;'\r\none ;\r\n ;\r\ntwo ;\r\n ;\r\nthree ;\r\n ;\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe above results are consistent in behavior if each input line is processed with newline intact. As a user, this is a bit unexpected as `printf 'one\\ntwo\\nthree\\n' | wc -l` or `printf 'one\\ntwo\\nthree\\n' | rg -c '^'` or `rg -c '$'` would give `3` as result. But the above use of line anchors with `-r` option results in 6 output lines. The use case I'm looking here is using `rg` as alternative to `sed` (search and replace only, not other features of sed)\r\n\r\nI thought using string anchors would help here, but I'm not sure how `\\z` works with ripgrep:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n$ printf 'one\\ntwo\\nthree\\n' | rg '\\A' -r '* '\r\n* one\r\n* two\r\n* three\r\n\r\n$ # no output\r\n$ printf 'one\\ntwo\\nthree\\n' | rg '\\z' -r ' ;'\r\n$ # this is the workaround I was able to find\r\n$ printf 'one\\ntwo\\nthree\\n' | rg -U '\\n' -r ' ;'\r\none ;\r\ntwo ;\r\nthree ;\r\n```\r\n\r\nSome more examples I tried with `\\z` to understand how to use it, could you explain what is happening here?\r\n\r\n![rg_string_anchor](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17766317/59083619-b70e5880-8915-11e9-92bd-d14c8841a291.png)\r\n\r\nSome examples with `-o` option:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n$ printf 'one\\ntwo\\nthree\\n' | rg -o 'e\\z'\r\none\r\nthree\r\n$ printf 'one\\ntwo\\nthree' | rg -o 'e\\z'\r\none\r\ne\r\n```\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/1295/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/1295/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":4822421566,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDQ4MjI0MjE1NjY=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/events/4822421566","actor":{"login":"BurntSushi","id":456674,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NjY3NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/456674?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi","html_url":"https://github.com/BurntSushi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"68561f9441b7d9a1a9aa77f219861f7e642c9095","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/commits/68561f9441b7d9a1a9aa77f219861f7e642c9095","created_at":"2021-06-01T00:49:15Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":4822538557,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50NDgyMjUzODU1Nw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/events/4822538557","actor":{"login":"BurntSushi","id":456674,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NjY3NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/456674?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi","html_url":"https://github.com/BurntSushi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":"fbb2cfed28d68b220e51c0fe8db9d89a4516aab6","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/commits/fbb2cfed28d68b220e51c0fe8db9d89a4516aab6","created_at":"2021-06-01T01:51:28Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":11794052268,"node_id":"REFE_lADOAzJbyc4sl_l7zwAAAAK--vSs","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/events/11794052268","actor":{"login":"vors","id":816680,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxNjY4MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/816680?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vors","html_url":"https://github.com/vors","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vors/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vors/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vors/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vors/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vors/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vors/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vors/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vors/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vors/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"fbb2cfed28d68b220e51c0fe8db9d89a4516aab6","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vors/ripgrep/commits/fbb2cfed28d68b220e51c0fe8db9d89a4516aab6","created_at":"2024-02-13T21:15:49Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
