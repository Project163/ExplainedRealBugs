https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/3076\r\n\r\nWhen we have matches on adjacent lines using multiline searcher we group them together before passing them to the sink. This behaviour allows replacement logic to work correctly, when we try to replace \"\\n\" with something else (see https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/1311 for more details).\r\n\r\nHowever, this also means that the `--max-count` option is not respected when grouping matches together, because max count is only enforced in a sink. And if we have multiple matches on adjacent lines they will be passed to the sink together, potentially going over the limit.\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes that by also calculating the number of matches in the searcher itself and breaking early in case max count is reached during the search. This way we make sure we don't overcount the matches.\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ cat file\r\nline 2\r\nline 3 x\r\nline 2\r\nline 3\r\n$ target/debug/rg --max-count=1 -U \"line 2\\nline 3\" file --stats --trace\r\nrg: DEBUG|rg::flags::parse|crates/core/flags/parse.rs:97: no extra arguments found from configuration file\r\nrg: DEBUG|rg::flags::hiargs|crates/core/flags/hiargs.rs:1084: number of paths given to search: 1\r\nrg: DEBUG|rg::flags::hiargs|crates/core/flags/hiargs.rs:1095: is_one_file? true\r\nrg: DEBUG|rg::flags::hiargs|crates/core/flags/hiargs.rs:1270: found hostname for hyperlink configuration: devserver\r\nrg: DEBUG|rg::flags::hiargs|crates/core/flags/hiargs.rs:1280: hyperlink format: \"\"\r\nrg: DEBUG|rg::flags::hiargs|crates/core/flags/hiargs.rs:174: using 1 thread(s)\r\nrg: DEBUG|ignore::gitignore|crates/ignore/src/gitignore.rs:393: opened gitignore file: /home/spv/.gitignore_global\r\nrg: DEBUG|globset|crates/globset/src/lib.rs:448: glob converted to regex: Glob { glob: \"**/.aider*\", re: \"(?-u)^(?:/?|.*/)\\\\.aider[^/]*$\", opts: GlobOptions { case_insensitive: false, literal_separator: tr\r\nue, backslash_escape: true, empty_alternates: false }, tokens: Tokens([RecursivePrefix, Literal('.'), Literal('a'), Literal('i'), Literal('d'), Literal('e'), Literal('r'), ZeroOrMore]) }\r\nrg: DEBUG|globset|crates/globset/src/lib.rs:448: glob converted to regex: Glob { glob: \"**/.claude*\", re: \"(?-u)^(?:/?|.*/)\\\\.claude[^/]*$\", opts: GlobOptions { case_insensitive: false, literal_separator:\r\ntrue, backslash_escape: true, empty_alternates: false }, tokens: Tokens([RecursivePrefix, Literal('.'), Literal('c'), Literal('l'), Literal('a'), Literal('u'), Literal('d'), Literal('e'), ZeroOrMore]) }\r\nrg: DEBUG|globset|crates/globset/src/lib.rs:453: built glob set; 0 literals, 8 basenames, 4 extensions, 0 prefixes, 0 suffixes, 0 required extensions, 2 regexes\r\nrg: TRACE|grep_regex::matcher|/home/spv/git/github.com/fspv/ripgrep/crates/regex/src/matcher.rs:66: final regex: \"(?:line 2\\nline 3)\"\r\nrg: TRACE|grep_regex::literal|crates/regex/src/literal.rs:59: skipping inner literal extraction, no line terminator is set\r\nrg: DEBUG|globset|crates/globset/src/lib.rs:453: built glob set; 0 literals, 0 basenames, 12 extensions, 0 prefixes, 0 suffixes, 0 required extensions, 0 regexes\r\nrg: TRACE|rg::search|crates/core/search.rs:254: file: binary detection: BinaryDetection(Convert(0))\r\nrg: TRACE|grep_searcher::searcher|/home/spv/git/github.com/fspv/ripgrep/crates/searcher/src/searcher/mod.rs:695: Some(\"file\"): searching via memory map\r\nrg: TRACE|grep_searcher::searcher|/home/spv/git/github.com/fspv/ripgrep/crates/searcher/src/searcher/mod.rs:794: slice reader: searching via multiline strategy\r\n1:line 2\r\n2:line 3 x\r\n\r\n1 matches\r\n2 matched lines\r\n1 files contained matches\r\n1 files searched\r\n20 bytes printed\r\n29 bytes searched\r\n0.000038 seconds spent searching\r\n0.003625 seconds\r\n```","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/3094/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/3094/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
