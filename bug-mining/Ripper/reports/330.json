In particular, ripgrep's Fish auto-completions are auto-generated by Clap (ripgrep's argv parser). I have no idea how good they are, but they are only provided by ripgrep because it's easy to provide them. Otherwise, I would not maintain them.\r\n\r\nThe actual reason to drop them is that they are causing problems. See #1485 and https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/pull/6868 in particular.\r\n\r\nThe plan here is:\r\n\r\n* [x] The ripgrep 12.1.0 release will include a notice that the Fish shell completions will be dropped from the next major version release.\r\n* [ ] The ripgrep 13.0.0 release will drop Fish shell completions.\r\n* [ ] The Fish project should be [notified](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/pull/6868#issuecomment-614078903) once the ripgrep 13 release is out so that they can merge ripgrep auto-completions as they see fit.","closed_by":{"login":"BurntSushi","id":456674,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NjY3NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/456674?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi","html_url":"https://github.com/BurntSushi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/1577/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/1577/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
