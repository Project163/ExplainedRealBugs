per the discussion on #544, this is my initial attempt at adding support for fixed width line numbers. Please review and let me know if things can be improved upon.\r\n\r\nA few thoughts I had as I worked on this:\r\n\r\n- Rust's `format!` macro currently has no way of providing a custom padding character as a parameter. You have to provide it directly in the format string itself. (As per [this](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/fmt/#syntax), only the width can be provided as a parameter.)\r\n- This meant that adding support for format strings as suggested in the issue discussion proved to be difficult. Right now, the argument only accepts a number. It seems that we'll have to write a custom code for left padding or rely on a library to achieve this. I'm open to suggestions on this one.\r\n- Should we handle possible combinations of CLI args? In the long help message for `line-number-width`, I've mentioned that it has no effect if `--no-line-number` is enabled, which is very obvious. Should I handle any other cases specific to this newly introduced argument to ensure nothing breaks?\r\n\r\nThanks in

What version of ripgrep are you using?\r\n\r\n```\r\nripgrep 0.8.1 (rev c8e9f25b85)\r\n-SIMD -AVX \r\n```\r\n#### How did you install ripgrep?\r\n\r\nFrom `.deb` binary.\r\n\r\n#### What operating system are you using ripgrep on?\r\n\r\nLinux Mint 18.1 Serena.\r\n\r\n#### Describe your question, feature request, or bug.\r\n\r\nFirst of all, thanks and congratulations for this tool.\r\n\r\nI've searched in the help and in the issues, and as I didn't find anything related, I'm opening this suggestion.\r\n\r\nI think that would be nice to add an option for trimming the output of the coincident lines. In other words, not to print the indentation of the lines. I think that this could improve the readability of the output.\r\n\r\nCurrently, for this search:\r\n\r\n```\r\nrg POST views/\r\n```\r\n\r\nI would get the following output:\r\n\r\n```\r\nviews/modals/contact.twig\r\n13:               <form action=\"/contact/send\" method=\"POST\" id=\"form-contact\">\r\n```\r\n(Note the code indentation).\r\n\r\nWith an option for trimming (e.g. `--trim`), we would get the following:\r\n\r\n```\r\nviews/modals/contact.twig\r\n13:<form action=\"/contact/send\" method=\"POST\" id=\"form-contact\">\r\n```\r\n(The indentation is now removed from the output).\r\n\r\nI really think that this could be a very useful option, since almost every part of the code is indented, except class or function definitions.\r\n\r\n**PD:** this could also work in combination with `--max-columns` option, so the trimming would be done before the output is filtered with this options. But as I know nothing about ripgrep internals and the feasibility and difficulty of this, I just leave it as a little extra suggestion. Actually this wouldn't be very relevant, since the `--max-columns` is thought for the output we actually don't want to see. So, if you find appropriate the original suggestion, just implement it as you think it's better for ripgrep. :) \r\n\r\nThanks again and keep up the great

of all, thanks so much for ripgrep, I use it all the time! 😍\r\n\r\nNow, my little suggestion\r\n\r\n#### Describe your feature request\r\n\r\nCurrently when searching in a terminals, matching lines are preceded by line numbers followed by \":\" or \"-\" depending on whether they are actual matches or context lines. This is cool.\r\n\r\nHowever, when the output includes successive lines with different number of digits, that can slightly decrease the readability of the output, specially for files where indentation is important. For example:\r\n\r\n```\r\n1-uk:\r\n2-  active_admin:\r\n3-    dashboard: \"Панель керування\"\r\n4-    dashboard_welcome:\r\n5-      welcome: \"Ласкаво просимо до Active Admin. Це стандартна сторінка керування сайтом.\"\r\n6-      call_to_action: \"Щоб додати сюди що-небудь, зазирніть у 'app/admin/dashboard.rb'\"\r\n7-    view: \"Переглянути\"\r\n8-    edit: \"Змінити\"\r\n9-    delete: \"Видалити\"\r\n10-    delete_confirmation: \"Ви впевнені, що хочете це видалити?\"\r\n11:    new_model: \"Створити %{model}\"\r\n12-    edit_model: \"Змінити %{model}\"\r\n13-    delete_model: \"Видалити %{model}\"\r\n14-    details: \"%{model} детальніше\"\r\n15-    cancel: \"Скасувати\"\r\n16-    empty: \"Пусто\"\r\n17-    previous: \"Поперед.\"\r\n18-    next: \"Наст.\"\r\n19-    download: \"Завантаження:\"\r\n20-    has_many_new: \"Додати %{model}\"\r\n21-    has_many_delete: \"Прибрати\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe `delete` and `delete_confirmation` keys are siblings, but the indentation makes it not that clear.\r\n\r\nWould it be desirable to justify line numbers to the highest number of digits of each chunk of output?\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/2179/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/2179/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"actor":{"login":"net","id":6983821,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY5ODM4MjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6983821?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/net","html_url":"https://github.com/net","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/net/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/net/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/net/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/net/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/net/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/net/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/net/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/net/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/net/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-03-19T16:57:15Z","updated_at":"2025-03-19T16:57:15Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MagicDuck/grug-far.nvim/issues/424","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MagicDuck/grug-far.nvim","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MagicDuck/grug-far.nvim/issues/424/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MagicDuck/grug-far.nvim/issues/424/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/MagicDuck/grug-far.nvim/issues/424/events","html_url":"https://github.com/MagicDuck/grug-far.nvim/issues/424","id":2932531795,"node_id":"I_kwDOL0dkHM6uyuJT","number":424,"title":"Align

line/column/context separator character (`-`, the first `:`, and the second `:`) in the above so that they can be hidden, or even better, a way to replace them with other characters (such as `┊`).\n\nThis would make grug-far easier to read, even more beautiful, and would bring it closer to GUI find and replace UIs.\n\nTwo neovim plugins that do something similar are [nvim-bfq](https://github.com/kevinhwang91/nvim-bqf):\n\n<img width=\"1798\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1593be60-1780-4759-bb95-557fd10c79bd\" />\n\nand [quicker.nvim](https://github.com/stevearc/quicker.nvim):\n\n<img width=\"813\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f92d76a8-8b44-4052-a35b-61d1afb458f6\" />\n\n<p>\n\nI think the ideal format for grug-far, while minimizing changes to the structure it expects, would look something like:\n\n```rg\napp/src/components/coreLoop/wordPractice/PracticeCard.tsx\n 98   │                          defaultColor=\"white\"\n 99   │                          onPress={onPressHighlightedWord}\n100:27│                          hideUnderline={false}\n101   │                          dottedUnderline={true}\n102   │                          hidePunctuation={false}\n      ┆\n706   │                          defaultColor=\"white\"\n707   │                          onPress={onPressHighlightedWord}\n708:27│                          hideUnderline={false}\n709   │                          dottedUnderline={usesDottedUnderline}\n710   │                          hidePunctuation={false}\n\napp/src/screens/Assessment/v1/results/PracticeWord.tsx\n 96   │            left\n 97   │            defaultColor=\"white\"\n 98:13│            hideUnderline={false}\n 99   │            hidePunctuation\n100   │            highlightOnlyTargetFragment\n```\n\n(with highlights for `│`, `┆`, and `:`, and where the blank `┆` lines signify a break in line numbers).\n\nThank you
