This is fundamentally a result of combining parallelism and the requirement that the output of each file is not interleaved. It sounds like you said you'd be OK with the output from different files being interleaved, but I'm not keen on adding this option to ripgrep. Instead, you have a few work-arounds available to you, assuming we've correctly diagnosed the problem:\r\n\r\n* Use parallelism via `xargs` or some other tool, just like you would with standard grep. e.g., `find ./ -print0 | xargs -0 rg foo`.\r\n* Use ripgrep's `-m/--max-count` flag to limit the number of matching lines it prints per file.
