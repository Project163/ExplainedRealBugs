I tried searching a big directory for a word without any additional options and there is pages of empty lines.\nWhen redirecting the oputput to a file it does not include the empty lines.\n\nI tested with a smaller directory and there are less empty lines.\n\nAs output redirection does not have a problem this might be related to special terminal characters?\n\nMy test system is an Ubuntu 14.04 LTS and I tested with uxterm and gnome-terminal.\nI built ripgrep using cargo in release mode.
