If not, we can return `ErrorKind::UnclosedClass` Then in the caller  when we detect that error  we could fall back to treating '[' as a literal by doing something like: \n```\n'[' => match self.parse_class() {\n    Ok(()) => {}\n    Err(error) => match error.kind {\n        ErrorKind::UnclosedClass => self.push_token(Token::Literal('['))?,\n        _ => return Err(error),\n    },\n},\n```\nThere’s a small edge case to consider: for example, if the input is [!].\nHere, the class is technically closed, but its content may not be valid. We need to decide whether to treat this as an invalid class or  interpreting the characters as literals.","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/comments/3280675388/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"mostafa630","id":103376741,"node_id":"U_kgDOBilnZQ","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/103376741?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mostafa630","html_url":"https://github.com/mostafa630","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mostafa630/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mostafa630/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mostafa630/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mostafa630/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mostafa630/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mostafa630/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mostafa630/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mostafa630/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mostafa630/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":19637414775,"node_id":"MEE_lADOAzJbyc7GOZ0nzwAAAASSeyt3","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/events/19637414775","actor":{"login":"BurntSushi","id":456674,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NjY3NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/456674?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi","html_url":"https://github.com/BurntSushi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2025-09-11T13:25:54Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":19637414799,"node_id":"SE_lADOAzJbyc7GOZ0nzwAAAASSeyuP","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/events/19637414799","actor":{"login":"BurntSushi","id":456674,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NjY3NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/456674?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi","html_url":"https://github.com/BurntSushi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2025-09-11T13:25:54Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/comments/3280699575","html_url":"https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/3127#issuecomment-3280699575","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/3127","id":3280699575,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAzJbyc7Di4C3","user":{"login":"BurntSushi","id":456674,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NjY3NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/456674?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi","html_url":"https://github.com/BurntSushi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-09-11
