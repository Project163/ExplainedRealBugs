were two important reasons for the switch:\r\n\r\n1. Performance. Docopt does poorly when the argv becomes large, which is\r\n   a reasonable common use case for search tools. (e.g., use with xargs)\r\n2. Better failure modes. Clap knows a lot more about how a particular\r\n   argv might be invalid, and can therefore provide much clearer error\r\n   messages.\r\n\r\nWhile both were important, (1) made it urgent.\r\n\r\nNote that since Clap requires at least Rust 1.11, this will in turn\r\nincrease the minimum Rust version supported by ripgrep from Rust 1.9 to\r\nRust 1.11. It is therefore a breaking change, so the soonest release of\r\nripgrep with Clap will have to be 0.3.\r\n\r\nThere is also at least one subtle breaking change in real usage.\r\nPrevious to this commit, this used to work:\r\n\r\n    rg -e -foo\r\n\r\nWhere this would cause ripgrep to search for the string `-foo`. Clap\r\ncurrently has problems supporting this use case\r\n(see: https://github.com/kbknapp/clap-rs/issues/742),\r\nbut it can be worked around by using this instead:\r\n\r\n    rg -e [-]foo\r\n\r\nor even\r\n\r\n    rg [-]foo\r\n\r\nand this still works:\r\n\r\n    rg -- -foo\r\n\r\nThis commit also adds Bash, Fish and PowerShell completion files to the\r\nrelease, fixes a bug that prevented ripgrep from working on file\r\npaths containing invalid UTF-8 and shows short descriptions in the\r\noutput of `-h` but longer descriptions in the output of `--help`.\r\n\r\nFixes #136, #189, #210, #230","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/233/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/233/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":856909914,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDg1NjkwOTkxNA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/events/856909914","actor":{"login":"BurntSushi","id":456674,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NjY3NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/456674?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi","html_url":"https://github.com/BurntSushi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"3184fc034bd9ebbed96f3d751b7a5d06a5057d9b","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/commits/3184fc034bd9ebbed96f3d751b7a5d06a5057d9b","created_at":"2016-11-13T02:48:17Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":856910899,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDg1NjkxMDg5OQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/events/856910899","actor":{"login":"BurntSushi","id":456674,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NjY3NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/456674?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi","html_url":"https://github.com/BurntSushi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"932e3a6b4899b9e5bc840104f972d14b81ae1efa","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/commits/932e3a6b4899b9e5bc840104f972d14b81ae1efa","created_at":"2016-11-13T02:54:53Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":856912744,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDg1NjkxMjc0NA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/events/856912744","actor":{"login":"BurntSushi","id":456674,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NjY3NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/456674?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi","html_url":"https://github.com/BurntSushi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"d9bd6547ca35954e1078ebc056d693e143605ef7","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/commits/d9bd6547ca35954e1078ebc056d693e143605ef7","created_at":"2016-11-13T03:06:45Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":863707965,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDg2MzcwNzk2NQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/events/863707965","actor":{"login":"BurntSushi","id":456674,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NjY3NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/456674?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi","html_url":"https://github.com/BurntSushi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/following{/othe
