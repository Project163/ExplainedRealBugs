Please tick this box to confirm you have reviewed the above.\n\n- [X] I have a different issue.\n\n### What version of ripgrep are you using?\n\n```\r\nripgrep 14.1.0\r\n\r\nfeatures:-simd-accel,+pcre2\r\nsimd(compile):+NEON\r\nsimd(runtime):+NEON\r\n\r\nPCRE2 10.42 is available (JIT is available)\r\n```\n\n### How did you install ripgrep?\n\nHomebrew\n\n### What operating system are you using ripgrep on?\n\n```\r\n$ sw_vers\r\nProductName:\t\tmacOS\r\nProductVersion:\t\t14.2.1\r\nBuildVersion:\t\t23C71\r\n$ uname -r\r\n23.2.0\r\n```\n\n### Describe your bug.\n\nUsing both of these flags together produces the expected output, for example, 2 lines of context with 1 match, but still highlights other matches that were not included due to `--max-count`.\r\n\r\n_Because_ these matches are only being included because of `--context`, it's unintuitive and confusing to the user to also highlight the text for the matches that weren't actually included.\r\n\r\nRelated: https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/1380\n\n### What are the steps to reproduce the behavior?\n\nRun `rg Pro -m 1 -C 2 therapeutic.txt`, you can find this file here:\r\nhttps://github.com/5HT2C/doses-logger/blob/master/therapeutic.txt\r\n\r\nIt's also fairly easy to produce a less specific test case yourself on any type of sorted data (where you are just matching the beginning and have context enabled).\n\n### What is the actual behavior?\n\nNotice how the lines are also suffixed with `:` before the line number instead of `-`.\r\n\r\n<img

much more intuitive:\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/assets/17222512/9895108f-38c1-4c4b-bf7d-ca08ba0d887a)\r\n\r\nI do understand that there is an argument against the behavior I am proposing, wherein a user might be confused by non-highlighted matches, but I feel like that would be encountered less often than the current behavior, and in the proposed case the issue would lie in \"user has forgotten they set the `--max-context` flag\" rather than the program's behavior being inconsistent / confusing.","closed_by":{"login":"BurntSushi","id":456674,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NjY3NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/456674?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi","html_url":"https://github.com/BurntSushi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/2843/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/2843/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
