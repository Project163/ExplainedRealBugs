running ripgrep like this:\r\n\r\n    rg foo > output\r\n\r\nwe must be careful not to search `output` since ripgrep is actively writing\r\nto it. Searching it can cause massive blowups where the file grows without\r\nbound.\r\n\r\nWhile this is conceptually easy to fix (check the inode of the redirection\r\nand the inode of the file you're about to search), there are a few problems\r\nwith it.\r\n\r\nFirst, inodes are a Unix thing, so we need a Windows specific solution to\r\nthis as well. To resolve this concern, I created a new crate, `same-file`,\r\nwhich provides a cross platform abstraction.\r\n\r\nSecond, stat'ing every file is costly. This is not avoidable on Windows,\r\nbut on Unix, we can get the inode number directly from directory traversal.\r\nHowever, this information wasn't exposed, but now it is (through both the\r\nignore and walkdir crates).\r\n\r\nFixes #286","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/310/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/310/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":916583426,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50OTE2NTgzNDI2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/events/916583426","actor":{"login":"BurntSushi","id":456674,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NjY3NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/456674?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi","html_url":"https://github.com/BurntSushi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2017-01-09T21:12:10Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":916583447,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDkxNjU4MzQ0Nw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/events/916583447","actor":{"login":"BurntSushi","id":456674,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NjY3NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/456674?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi","html_url":"https://github.com/BurntSushi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"461e0c4e33b38532545af4f97ec92bd367963017","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/commits/461e0c4e33b38532545af4f97ec92bd367963017","created_at":"2017-01-09T21:12:10Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
