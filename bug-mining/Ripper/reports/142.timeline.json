But the [ARM build does not add any additional CPU features since it isn't considered an SSSE3 target](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/blob/81afe8c5a0a04960353b68731a0c6d31436da04e/ci/before_deploy.sh#L10-L17) (which makes sense, since SSSE3 is an x86 thing).\r\n\r\nBasically, someone else will need to debug this. I did actually try running the CI build on my machine, but installing the requisite cross compiler required me to build from source on Archlinux, and I don't feel like doing that. But basically, the compilers being used are in the `.travis.yml` here: https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/blob/81afe8c5a0a04960353b68731a0c6d31436da04e/.travis.yml#L40-L43 And the `$TARGET` used is here: https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/blob/81afe8c5a0a04960353b68731a0c6d31436da04e/.travis.yml#L36 which is `arm-unknown-linux-gnueabihf`, which seems to be what you want.\r\n\r\nSo... I don't know. :-/

If I also assume the `arm-unknown-linux-gnueabihf` target is already added, it takes 5m25s. I made sure to `cargo clean` in between.

conflicting with the current ARM target, which is probably more appropriate for generic ARM architectures (this would probably be best released as `arm-rpi-` or something of the sort, since I don't know if the toolchain will work on other non-rpi devices, but it still uses `--target=arm-unknown-linux-gnueabihf` which I assume would overwrite the other ARM release).\r\n\r\nThe other ARM release could be specified as the ARMV7 target (since that what it seems to work on), and `arm-unknown-linux-gnueabihf` could be used for this one, but that still wouldn't help point out to users that this one may be rpi specific.","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/comments/374058198/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"n8henrie","id":1234956,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMzQ5NTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1234956?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/n8henrie","html_url":"https://github.com/n8henrie","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/n8henrie/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/n8henrie/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/n8henrie/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/n8henrie/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/n8henrie/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/n8henrie/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/n8henrie/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/n8henrie/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/n8henrie/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"actor":{"login":"n8henrie","id":1234956,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMzQ5NTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1234956?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/n8henrie","html_url":"https://github.com/n8henrie","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/n8henrie/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/n8henrie/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/n8henrie/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/n8henrie/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/n8henrie/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/n8henrie/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/n8henrie/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/n8henrie/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/n8henrie/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-07-23T16:28:46Z","updated_at":"2018-07-23T16:28:46Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mdaffin/rpizw-rover/issues/2","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mdaffin/rpizw-rover","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mdaffin/rpizw-rover/issues/2/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mdaffin/rpizw-rover/issues/2/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mdaffin/rpizw-rover/issues/2/events","html_url":"https://github.com/mdaffin/rpizw-rover/issues/2","id":343463617,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWUzNDM0NjM2MTc=","number":2,"title":"Cross

PR adds a workflow that creates \"arm-unknown-linux-gnueabihf\" builds for the \"slim\" and \"full\" versions with \"alsa_backend\" using cross compilation.\r\n\r\nThe resulting packages are called `spotifyd-linux-armhf-slim.tar.gz` and `spotifyd-linux-armhf-full.tar.gz`.\r\n\r\nAs a new package source has to be installed, `ubuntu-latest` cannot be used here, so the new step uses `ubuntu-18.04` (which currently is the same, but we need to be sure).\r\n\r\nInstead of a full `sbuild` setup, the armhf packages are installed and copied manually, which may look dirty. Unfortunately, `dbus-rs` needs quite some system packages, so we need to download and put them where the linker expects them to be. This process is described here: https://github.com/diwic/dbus-rs/issues/184#issuecomment-520228758\r\n\r\nIssues:\r\n\r\n- I'm not sure if the binaries produced by this run on the Raspberry Pi 1 (or Zero). To be able to run on these, it might be necessary to use the [arm-bcm2708](https://github.com/raspberrypi/tools/tree/master/arm-bcm2708) linker from raspberrypi/tools, as stated here: https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/676#issuecomment-374058198\r\n- Can someone test the `full` version? I can build it, but cannot get MPRIS D-Bus running on my machine, which may as well be a client problem: the process refuses to start without `$DISPLAY`, and when using the system dbus, `playerctl` acts up and won't display anything. Not sure if I broke this or it did not work at all in the first place. (If I understand it correctly, starting the `full` version *always* requires D-Bus? #244)\r\n\r\nRelated: #259, #280, #286","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Spotifyd/spotifyd/issues/479/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":1,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Spotifyd/spotifyd/issues/479/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
