Also, as mentioned, using a non-valid path on windows leads to extra trouble which I don't see how to fix, actually..\r\n\r\nAbout API: A `Candidate::from_bytes<P: AsRef<[u8]>(path: P) -> Self` (replace naming if you find something more suited) would be sufficient from my point of view. I agree that having traits such that the matching methods would run with both `AsRef<std::path::Path>` and `AsRef<[u8]>` would be even more elegant.\r\n\r\nI however respect if you don't want to change your API. In that case I'd actually prefer to maintain a fork which provides that functionality (which seems to be the lesser evil to me compared to the conversion hassle when coding
