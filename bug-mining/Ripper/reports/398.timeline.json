It turns out that ripgrep 13 was only working accidentally here. For example, I can make it fail:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ printf '%s\\0' 'bar' 'hello' 'world' | rg-13.0.0 --null-data --line-regexp '\\w{3}'\r\n$\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd I can even make ripgrep 14 succeed with a sufficiently wacky regex:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ printf '%s\\0' 'foo' 'bar' 'hello' 'world' | rg --null-data --line-regexp '[A-Z]*bar|[A-Y]*blahblah'\r\nbar%\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhat is happening here are literal optimizations. When searching for `foo` with ripgrep 13, ripgrep builds a regex like `(?m:^)foo(?m:$)`, and because the old regex engine couldn't handle literal optimizations involving line anchors, ripgrep plucked out `foo` as an inner literal and scanned for that first. Once it found a \"line\" containing `foo`, it _strips the line terminators_ and then runs the full regex. Thus, it finds a match.\r\n\r\nBut in ripgrep 14, the regex engine is a lot more sophisticated and can handle the literal optimization on its own. So ripgrep backs off and let's it do its thing. But of course, in this context, the regex engine is running on potentially many lines at once, and so the `(?m:^)` and `(?m:$)` really need to be able to match. By default, they only match `\\n`. And thus, no match is found because NUL is used as a line terminator.\r\n\r\nThankfully, in the rewrite of the regex engine, I added a new [config option to set the line terminator used by `(?m:^)` and `(?m:$)`](https://docs.rs/regex-automata/latest/regex_automata/meta/struct.Config.html#method.line_terminator). Indeed, I did it for _exactly_ this use case. I just haven't gotten around to making ripgrep use that option yet. Its handling of line terminators is pretty twisted and needs to be unfucked.\r\n\r\nI think as a stop-gap, I'll make ripgrep divert to the \"slower\" line-by-line search when `--null-data` is used. That will ensure correct operation at least.","author_association":"OWNER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/comments/1828942653/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":1,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"BurntSushi","id":456674,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NjY3NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/456674?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi","html_url":"https://github.com/BurntSushi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":11077938149,"node_id":"LE_lADOAzJbyc538MIhzwAAAAKUS-vl","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/events/11077938149","actor":{"login":"BurntSushi","id":456674,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NjY3NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/456674?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi","html_url":"https://github.com/BurntSushi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2023-11-28T02:09:30Z","label":{"name":"rollup","color":"ffccee"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":11077939841,"node_id":"REFE_lADOAzJbyc538MIhzwAAAAKUS_KB","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/events/11077939841","actor":{"login":"BurntSushi","id":456674,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NjY3NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/456674?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi","html_url":"https://github.com/BurntSushi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"5e95db8f6e752ac6391d55707f516e7e8e64fea5","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/commits/5e95db8f6e752ac6391d55707f516e7e8e64fea5","created_at":"2023-11-28T02:09:50Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":11077946877,"node_id":"REFE_lADOAzJbyc538MIhzwAAAAKUTA39","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/events/11077946877","actor":{"login":"BurntSushi","id":456674,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NjY3NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/456674?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi","html_url":"https://github.com/BurntSushi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"ev
