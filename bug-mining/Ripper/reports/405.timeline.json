some rare cases, it was possible for ripgrep's inner literal detector\r\nto extract a set of literals that could produce a false negative. #2884\r\ngives an example: `(?i:e.x|ex)`. In this case, the set extracted can be\r\ndiscovered by running `rg '(?i:e.x|ex) --trace`:\r\n\r\n    Seq[E(\"EX\"), E(\"Ex\"), E(\"eX\"), E(\"ex\")]\r\n\r\nThis extraction leads to building a multi-substring matcher for `EX`,\r\n`Ex`, `eX` and `ex`. Searching the haystack `e-x` produces no match,\r\nand thus, ripgrep shows no matches. But the regex `(?i:e.x|ex)` matches\r\n`e-x`.\r\n\r\nThe issue at play here was that when two extracted literal sequences\r\nwere unioned, we were incorrectly unioning their \"prefix\" attribute.\r\nAnd this in turn leads to those literal sequences being combined\r\nincorrectly via cross product. This case in particular triggers it\r\nbecause two different optimizations combine to produce an incorrect\r\nresult. Firslty, the regex has a common prefix extracted and is\r\nrewritten as `(?i:e(?:.x|x))`. Secondly, the `x` in the first branch of\r\nthe alternation has its `prefix` attribute set to `false` (correctly),\r\nwhich means it can't be cross producted with another concatenation. But\r\nin this case, it is unioned with the `x` from the second branch, and\r\nthis results in the union result having `prefix` set to `true`. This\r\nin turn pops up and lets it get cross producted with the `e` prefix,\r\nproducing an incorrect literal sequence.\r\n\r\nWe fix this by changing the implementation of `union` to return\r\n`prefix` set to `true` only when *both* literal sequences being unioned\r\nhave `prefix` set to `true`.\r\n\r\nDoing this exposed a second bug that was present, but was purely\r\ncosmetic: the extracted literals in this case, after the fix, are\r\n`X` and `x`. They were considered \"exact\" (i.e., lead to a match),\r\nbut of course they are not. Observing an `X` or an `x` does not mean\r\nthere is a match. This was fixed by making `choose` always return\r\nan inexact literal sequence. This is perhaps too conservative in\r\naggregate in some cases, but always correct. The idea here is that if\r\none is choosing between two concatenations, then it is likely the case\r\nthat the sequence returned should be considered inexact. The issue\r\nis that this can lead to avoiding cross products in some cases that\r\nwould otherwise be correct. This is bad because it means extracting\r\nshorter literals in some cases. (In general, the longer the literal the\r\nbetter.) But we prioritize correctness for now and fix it. You can see\r\na few tests where this shortens some extracted literals.\r\n\r\nFixes #2884\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/2885/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/2885/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/comments/2336967719","html_url":"https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/2884#issuecomment-2336967719","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/2884","id":2336967719,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAzJbyc6LS0wn","user":{"login":"BurntSushi","id":456674,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NjY3NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/456674?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi","html_url":"https://github.com/BurntSushi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-09-09T02:00:38Z","updated_at":"2024-09-09T02:00:38Z","body":"Excellent find. When you find weird behaviors like this where small perturbations to the regex make the bug go away, it almost always points toward literal extraction. In this case, the bug was in ripgrep's inner literal extractor (which isn't in the regex engine), and that only runs when the regex engine believes its own optimizations \"aren't great.\" And there are tons of layers here. In this case, multiple optimizations and heuristics have to come together to produce an incorrect result.\r\n\r\nThis is also made clearer in ripgrep's trace logging, which shows the literals it extracted which are clearly incorrect:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ echo \"e-x\" | rg-14.1.0 \"(?i:e.x|ex)\" --trace\r\nrg: DEBUG|rg::flags::config|crates/core/flags/config.rs:41: /home/andrew/.ripgreprc:

for a matching bug. In particular, a bug\r\nwas found that could cause ripgrep to ignore lines that should match. That is,\r\nfalse negatives. It is difficult to characterize the specific set of regexes\r\nin which this occurs as it requires multiple different optimization strategies\r\nto collide and produce an incorrect result. But as one reported example, in\r\nripgrep, the regex `(?i:e.x|ex)` does not match `e-x` when it should. (This\r\nbug is a result of an inner literal optimization performed in the `grep-regex`\r\ncrate and not in the `regex` crate.)\r\n\r\n> In case you haven't heard of it before, ripgrep is a line-oriented search\r\n> tool that recursively searches the current directory for a regex pattern.\r\n> By default, ripgrep will respect gitignore rules and automatically skip\r\n> hidden files/directories and binary files.\r\n\r\nBug fixes:\r\n\r\n* [BUG #2884](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/2884):\r\n  Fix bug where ripgrep could miss some matches that it should report.\r\n\r\nMiscellaneous:\r\n\r\n* [MISC #2748](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/2748):\r\n  Remove ripgrep's `simd-accel` feature because it was frequently broken.</pre>\n</details>\n\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Homebrew/homebrew-core/issues/184115/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Homebrew/homebrew-core/issues/184115/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":14248071973,"node_id":"REFE_lADOAzJbyc6VxIazzwAAAANRQFMl","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/events/14248071973","actor":{"login":"tmeijn","id":17970041,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3OTcwMDQx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17970041?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmeijn","html_url":"https://github.com/tmeijn","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmeijn/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmeijn/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmeijn/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmeijn/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmeijn/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmeijn/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmeijn/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmeijn/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmeijn/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"3bf0b2859aa219a5b08b5969a89d569fc763a766","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tmeijn/dotfiles/commits/3bf0b2859aa219a5b08b5969a89d569fc763a766","created_at":"2024-09-13T12:19:08Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
