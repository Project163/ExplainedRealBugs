This is done to permit more efficient parallelism when searching. That is, only one thread can be writing to `stdout` at any point in time, but multiple threads can write to their own thread local memory buffer.\n\nThis does have undesirable end user consequences:\n1. It can result in high memory usage when the number of search results is high.\n2. When searching a single file, no output is seen until the search is complete.\n\nWe should be able to do quite a bit to fix these issues:\n1. If a single file is given to search, then don't try any parallelism and make searching write to `stdout` directly.\n2. If `--threads 1` is given, then do (1) regardless of the number of inputs.\n","closed_by":{"login":"BurntSushi","id":456674,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NjY3NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/456674?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi","html_url":"https://github.com/BurntSushi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/4/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/4/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
