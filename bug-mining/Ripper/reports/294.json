I find myself using the same glob patterns pretty regularly, so having a way to define common patterns seemed like it would save me a tremendous amount of time... until I saw that \"Type settings are NOT persisted\".  \r\nI found this rather disappointing because it meant that `--type-add` would only ever save time if I wrapped `rg` in an alias or function.  \r\nIt wasn't until much later (today in fact!) that I saw that ripgrep supports configuration files.  This effectively means that I _can_ persist my type definitions.\r\n\r\nGiven the severe limitation of type definitions not being automatically persisted, I would strongly suggest updating the help text/manpages of `--type-add` and `--type-clear` to also mention the existence of using a configuration file as a workaround.  Yes, the configuration file guide uses `--type-add` as an example, but most users may not realize that a configuration file solution exists if something doesn't point them directly to it.\r\n\r\nIn summary, I suggest changing this line:\r\n\r\n> Note that this MUST be passed to every invocation of ripgrep. Type settings are NOT persisted.\r\n\r\nInto something like this:\r\n\r\n> Note that this MUST be passed to every invocation of ripgrep. Type settings are NOT persisted.  See CONFIGURATION FILES for a workaround.","closed_by":{"login":"BurntSushi","id":456674,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NjY3NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/456674?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi","html_url":"https://github.com/BurntSushi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/1571/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/1571/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
