I always got an error back because it seems that CtrlP always sends the path in windows format, which rg doesn't like, because apparently it tries to interpret the path as a regex (I checked this on the command line).\r\n\r\nStrangely enough, even when setting 'shellslash' to on, the behaviour doesn't change (I'm gonna open an issue with CtrlP about this), so I had to resort to a custom batch script that substitutes the backslashes with forward slashes. Hacky to say the least.. :P\r\n\r\nI think backslash support in Windows should be improved. I'm surprised nobody had problems with this before.. I don't know what the best approach would be, though. Maybe a specific switch or marker char that would mean \"use this verbatim\" or something?","closed_by":{"login":"BurntSushi","id":456674,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NjY3NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/456674?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi","html_url":"https://github.com/BurntSushi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/326/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/326/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
