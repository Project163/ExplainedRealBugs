Thanks for the good bug report though!\r\n\r\n> When I use a Walk to iterate a directory containing a subdirectory with restricted permissions, it yields two separate entries for that subdirectory - one with an `Ok(DirEntry {...})` and one with an `Err(WithPath {...})`.\r\n\r\nIt's a bit more subtle than that. When you list the contents of `sandbox`, part of that listing includes `restricted_dir`, and there is no problem _observing_ the existence of that directory. The subsequent error that occurs comes from attempting to _descend_ into that directory, which is prevented from happening because of the permissions on that entry. In other words, this seems like correct behavior to me. That is, you aren't seeing duplicate entries.\r\n\r\n> I think I expected that calling `DirEntry::error()` on the `DirEntry {...}` in the `Ok` would give me back the same `WithPath` error, or some other indicator that ignore won't be able to recur into that directory.\r\n\r\nThe `DirEntry::error()` method exists to return errors unrelated to traversing the directory itself, but rather, related to any ancillary behavior required to support filtering. For example, in order to respect `.gitignore` rules, those files must be opened and parsed. Errors can occur while reading data from that file or while parsing data from that file. These errors don't impact traversal specifically, and shouldn't prevent traversal from continuing. These errors also shouldn't be suppressed completely since the command line application may want to surface them depending on the use case.\r\n\r\nThe documentation on the `error` method isn't great. It gives an example of an error, but is still somewhat cryptic. I think improving the documentation on that method would be a great idea.","author_association":"OWNER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/comments/397822640/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"BurntSushi","id":456674,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NjY3NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/456674?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi","html_url":"https://github.com/BurntSushi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":1684699173,"node_id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDE2ODQ2OTkxNzM=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/events/1684699173","actor":{"login":"BurntSushi","id":456674,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NjY3NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/456674?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi","html_url":"https://github.com/BurntSushi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-06-16T16:11:11Z","label":{"name":"doc","color":"fbca04"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/comments/397939581","html_url":"https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/953#issuecomment-397939581","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/953","id":397939581,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM5NzkzOTU4MQ==","user":{"login":"sashaweiss","id":9013117,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkwMTMxMTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9013117?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sashaweiss","html_url":"https://github.com/sashaweiss","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sashaweiss/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sashaweiss/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sashaweiss/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sashaweiss/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sashaweiss/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sashaweiss/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sashaweiss/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sashaweiss/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sashaweiss/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-06-18T04:33:37Z","updated_at":"2018-06-18T04:33:37Z","body":"Gotcha - thanks so much for the detailed response!

(I initially thought it'd also error if the current entry is a directory containing a poorly formatted one of the above, but I no longer think that's true?)\r\n\r\nIf that is the case, it's not clear to me that there's a lot to be added to the docstring for `error`. However, it might reduce ambiguity to be more concrete about the kind of errors that could be returned?\r\n\r\nI think my confusion came from the ambiguity inherent in \"An example of an error is...\". If the only errors are ignore parsing errors, maybe the docstring could be more explicit about that? Unless I misread, of course. In that case, if the set of errors is still relatively discrete maybe the docstring could enumerate them, or say something more along the lines of \"This method is intended for detecting that parsing an `ignore` file errored. While other errors such as `<other error case>` may occur, these should be relatively rare.\"\r\n\r\nRe: the fact that `Walk` will return two entries for a permission-restricted subdirectory, I was largely able to come to the same conclusion you replied with while I was writing the bug report (i.e. that this could be expected behavior) - hopefully anyone who hits that in the future will be able to do the same, or can use this thread as a reference!
