Namely, I think ripgrep only ever produces `0` or `1` as an exit code, but it would be nice to reserve `1` for \"no match\" and use some other exit code (probably `2`) in the case of a real error. This is what GNU grep does.","author_association":"OWNER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/comments/397588872/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"BurntSushi","id":456674,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NjY3NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/456674?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi","html_url":"https://github.com/BurntSushi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":1683149870,"node_id":"MDE3OlJlbmFtZWRUaXRsZUV2ZW50MTY4MzE0OTg3MA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/events/1683149870","actor":{"login":"BurntSushi","id":456674,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NjY3NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/456674?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi","html_url":"https://github.com/BurntSushi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"renamed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-06-15T11:08:39Z","rename":{"from":"Exit

that due to https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/948 ripgrep learnt how to distinguish errors (exit code 2) from no results (exit code 1), like Grep.\r\n\r\nHowever, if you invoke `rg` with a non-existent flag, you'll still get exit code 1, which means that there is no way to programmatically distinguish between no results and a botched invocation.\r\n\r\n```\r\nrg --wat\r\nerror: Found argument '--wat' which wasn't expected, or isn't valid in this context\r\n\r\nUSAGE:\r\n\r\n    rg [OPTIONS] PATTERN [PATH ...]\r\n    rg [OPTIONS] [-e PATTERN ...] [-f PATTERNFILE ...] [PATH ...]\r\n    rg [OPTIONS] --files [PATH ...]\r\n    rg [OPTIONS] --type-list\r\n    command | rg [OPTIONS] PATTERN\r\n\r\nFor more information try --help\r\nzsh: exit 1     rg --wat\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor comparison, `grep` exits with status 2 for unrecognized flags. `ack` exits with status 255 for unrecognized flags. `ag` suffers from the same problem, exiting with 1 indistinctly for bad invocations and for no results (issue: https://github.com/ggreer/the_silver_searcher/issues/1298).\r\n\r\nFWIW, I wasn't able to get `rg` (at least not v0.10.0) to return an exit status of 2, despite what https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/pull/954 ostensibly does:\r\n\r\n```\r\nrg something /non-existent-directory\r\n/non-existent-directory: No such file or directory (os error 2)\r\nzsh: exit 1     rg something /non-existent-directory\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote that it's still exiting with status 1.

know this has been discussed here before. I'm not really sure what I'm expecting to happen, but I do want to add some thoughts to the conversation.\r\n\r\nI've seen a lot of developers get bit by `grep`'s behavior of returning `1` when there are no matches, and I have personally had to work around this more times than I care to remember. So, I was sad to see this \"feature\" was replicated by `ripgrep`. I understand it can be useful in the following use case:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nif rg -q foo file; then\r\n    echo matched\r\nfi\r\n```\r\nIMO, there is a better way to handle this specific case. I'm not aware of other use cases, so it would be interesting to learn about them if they exist.\r\n\r\n## The problem with returning `1`\r\n\r\nThe root of the problem with returning `1` for no matches is that \"no matches\" is a perfectly normal and successful result for a search, but various aspects of shell scripting assume any non-zero return code is an error. This has a few annoying manifestations, but at a high level means error handing with `grep`/`ripgrep` is now more complicated. As error handling is highly desirable in reliable software, using these tools can introduce bugs because they don't follow the \"non-zero return code is an error\" convention. Some examples:\r\n\r\n### 1. bailing out with `-e`\r\n\r\nOne very common pattern for handling errors in scripts is to set the `-e` option. This causes the script to terminate in the event of any error encountered in the script. This isn't a great way to do error handling, but it does at least prevent your script from doing dumb things if a step in the middle fails. Because `ripgrep` returns `1` for no matches, you cannot use it in a script with `-e` set. I've seen this bite a lot of devs, as scripts appear to work normally, but sometimes fail silently for no obvious reason with no error output. The reason is that a `grep` somewhere had no matches.\r\n\r\n### 2. propagating errors with `-o pipefail`\r\n\r\nSimilarly, one can bail out of a series of piped commands if one of them fails by setting `-o pipefail`. This is very useful because you often otherwise end up propagating an empty string through your piped commands, again leading to silent failures that are not obvious. Because `ripgrep` returns `1` for no matches, you cannot use it in a series of piped commands with `-o pipefail` enabled. You can work around it by splitting your code, but the result is very ugly.\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n# without pipefail\r\n\r\nresults=\"$(rg 'foo' file-name.txt | sed 's/bar//' | sort | uniq -c | head)\"\r\n# $? == 0, even if file-name.txt does not exist\r\n# we can't handle (most) errors because we can't detect them\r\n\r\n# with pipefail\r\n\r\nset -o pipefail\r\n\r\nresults=\"$(rg 'foo' file-name.txt | sed 's/bar//' | sort | uniq -c | head)\"\r\n# $? == 1 if file-name.txt does not contain 'foo'; sed does not run\r\n# handing errors is impossible because we don't know where the `1` came from\r\n\r\n# so, we must split rg into its own execution, inefficiently spooling results into a variable\r\n# it's also very verbose\r\nmatches=\"$(rg 'foo' file-name.txt)\"\r\nrc=\"$?\"\r\nif [[ \"$rc\" -gt \"1\" ]]; then\r\n   exit \"$rc\"\r\nfi\r\n\r\nresults=\"$(echo \"$matches\" | sed 's/bar//' | sort | uniq -c | head)\"\r\n# now I can handle errors with $?\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Alternatives\r\n\r\nIf the only use case for returning `1` for no matches is so `ripgrep` can be used in conditionals, why not have a flag specifically for that?\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n# instead of this:\r\nif rg -q foo file; then\r\n    echo matched\r\nfi\r\n\r\n# why not this:\r\nif rg --matches foo file; then\r\n    echo matched\r\nfi\r\n```\r\n\r\nMaybe I'm missing another use case, but it seems to me you would never use `-q` unless you were going to look at the return code. So rather than having a flag that works with the normal return codes indirectly to get what you want (`-q`), why not have a flag that specifically handles the conditional use case? E.g. `ripgrep` normally returns `0` on success and non-`0` on error; passing it `--matches` (or whatever you want to call it) suppresses output and changes the return code to be `0` for one or more matches and `1` for no matches. You can then remove `-q`.\r\n\r\n## Related\r\n\r\nThis is most closely related to https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/1290.
