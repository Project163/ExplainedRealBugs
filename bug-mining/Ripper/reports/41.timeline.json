The `.gitignore` in the root repo has over 3,000 patterns in it.

this one took me a while because I paid back some technical debt.\n\nWhile this issue can technically still arise, I've reduced the chance of it occurring substantially. There is still another path we can take to fix it for good, but I'll wait until it actually happens so I have a real test case to look at. In particular, I can now search the MySQL repo in reasonable time (three times faster than the silver searcher).\n\nAs it happens, this repo is a good example of where `git grep` can steal our lunch (on simple literals only) and there's not much we can do about it.
