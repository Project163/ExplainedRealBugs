Kudos to @balajisivaraman for already having done the work to easily add more decompressors in a general fashion.\r\n\r\nSomething like:\r\n\r\n```\r\n+ const ARGS_ZSTD: &[&str] = &[\"zstd\", \"-d\", \"-c\"];\r\n...\r\n+     cmd(\"*.zst\", ARGS_ZSTD),\r\n```\r\n\r\nI can't find where the OPTIONS (`-z, --search-zip`) portion of the manual page is stored in the directory hierarchy, but that should be updated as well.\r\n\r\nShould be pretty trivial!
