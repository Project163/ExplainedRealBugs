And as a result, it actually differs from GNU grep in some cases (and even with PCRE2 within ripgrep):\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ echo '###' | grep -w -o .\r\n#\r\n#\r\n#\r\n$ echo '###' | rg-13.0.0 -w -o .\r\n#\r\n#\r\n$ echo '###' | rg-13.0.0 -P -w -o .\r\n#\r\n#\r\n#\r\n```\r\n\r\nripgrep 14 will fix this:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ echo '###' | rg-14.0.0 -w -o .\r\n#\r\n#\r\n#\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe actual issue here is that ripgrep used a hacky work-around to implement `-w/--word-regexp` that just didn't work right in all cases. For PCRE2, it was implemented via look-around assertions that always got it right:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/blob/52731cdfb2e1f10ee068d8c40fac819484615c81/crates/pcre2/src/matcher.rs#L64-L69\r\n\r\nThe work-around I used basically tried to emulate look-around with capture groups. And while it works in a lot of cases, it doesn't work in all of them. I spent quite a bit of time trying to figure out how to fix the work-around once and for all, but couldn't see a way to make the code obviously correct. Instead, I just added support for `\\b{start-half}` and `\\b{end-half}` word boundary assertions that do exactly what the look-around does in PCRE2.
