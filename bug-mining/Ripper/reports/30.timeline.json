What version of ripgrep are you using?\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nripgrep 0.8.1 (rev c8e9f25b85)\r\n-SIMD -AVX\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### What operating system are you using ripgrep on?\r\n\r\nWindows 10\r\n\r\n#### Describe your question, feature request, or bug.\r\n\r\nOn Windows 10, using MSYS ([Git bash for Windows](https://git-scm.com/downloads), in my case) `ripgrep -l` will not pipe the files in a way that actually allows them to be used as an argument for another item.\r\n\r\n#### If this is a bug, what are the steps to reproduce the behavior?\r\n\r\nReproduction:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n~/dev/ripgrep$ rg fast -l\r\n\r\nCHANGELOG.md\r\nappveyor.yml\r\nFAQ.md\r\nGUIDE.md\r\nREADME.md\r\n...\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### If this is a bug, what is the actual behavior?\r\n\r\n`ripgrep -l` output cannot be piped to stuff like sed.\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n~/dev/ripgrep$ rg fast -l | xargs sed s/fast/FAST/g -i\r\n\r\nsed: can't read appveyor.yml: No such file or directory\r\nsed: can't read CHANGELOG.md: No such file or

If this is a bug, what is the expected behavior?\r\n\r\nI have confirmed this is an MSYS specific issue, doing the same thing in WSL will work as expected:\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3832380/39061610-828a3550-448a-11e8-9627-6635daf26c2f.png)\r\n\r\nThis is not a huge problem for me, but it'd still be nice to have this work.\r\n\r\nSorry if I am stupidly missing something obvious. And also sorry if this is a MSYS issue rather than a `rg` issue.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/890/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/890/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
