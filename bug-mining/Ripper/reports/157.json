If I tweak the pattern slightly, it will find the lines.  Changing the contents of the files also can bring the missing lines back into the result set.\r\n\r\nI was searching a repo of several thousand Java files for an endpoint containing the path \"/upsert/rateplans\".  I initially used \"/upsert/rate\" as the pattern.  `rg` found some matches, but not the one I was looking for.  Extending the pattern to \"/upsert/ratep\" brings in the expected match.  Omitting the leading slash like \"upsert/rate\" will also yield correct results.\r\n\r\nI tried stripping down the files to just the matching lines for a minimal test corpus, but `rg` finds everything in that case.  I can restrict the search to just three files and reproduce the problem, however.\r\n\r\n#### If this is a bug, what are the steps to reproduce the behavior?\r\n\r\nI copied the three files with expected matches to a new directory and stomped most lines with `sed -e '/upsert/!s/[a-zA-Z]/a/g'` (replace all letters with \"a\" on lines not containing \"upsert\").\r\n\r\nHere are the scrubbed files:\r\nhttps://gist.github.com/josh-duetto/065e1b579d72164dc4deb7b54d9279a6\r\n\r\nSorry for all the \"aaaaa\" spam, but it seems to be somewhat necessary to reproduce the bug.\r\nAlso if I change the scrub command to `sed -e '/upsert/!s/./-/g'` then the matches show up again, so there seems to be something more going on than just the byte offset of the match text in the corpus.\r\n\r\nExpected matches:\r\n```\r\n[josh@yawp rg2]$ grep -nHrF /upsert/rate .\r\n./one.java:115:            .setServer(\"http://127.0.0.1:9090/upsert/rates\");\r\n./three.java:141:    private static final String UPSERT_RATE_PLANS_ENDPOINT = \"/v1/upsert/rateplans\";\r\n./two.java:43:    private static final String DARI_RATE_PATH = \"/upsert/rates\";\r\n```\r\n\r\nRipgrep results (missing \"three.java:141\"):\r\n```\r\n[josh@yawp rg2]$ rg --debug --no-heading -F /upsert/rate\r\nDEBUG:grep::search: regex ast:\r\nLiteral {\r\n    chars: [\r\n        '/',\r\n        'u',\r\n        'p',\r\n        's',\r\n        'e',\r\n        'r',\r\n        't',\r\n        '/',\r\n        'r',\r\n        'a',\r\n        't',\r\n        'e'\r\n    ],\r\n    casei: false\r\n}\r\nDEBUG:grep::literals: literal prefixes detected: Literals { lits: [Complete(/upsert/rate)], limit_size: 250, limit_class: 10 }\r\none.java:115:            .setServer(\"http://127.0.0.1:9090/upsert/rates\");\r\ntwo.java:43:    private static final String DARI_RATE_PATH = \"/upsert/rates\";\r\n```\r\n\r\nTweaked successful match:\r\n```\r\n[josh@yawp rg2]$ rg --debug --no-heading -F upsert/rate\r\nDEBUG:grep::search: regex ast:\r\nLiteral {\r\n    chars: [\r\n        'u',\r\n        'p',\r\n        's',\r\n        'e',\r\n        'r',\r\n        't',\r\n        '/',\r\n        'r',\r\n        'a',\r\n        't',\r\n        'e'\r\n    ],\r\n    casei: false\r\n}\r\nDEBUG:grep::literals: literal prefixes detected: Literals { lits: [Complete(upsert/rate)], limit_size: 250, limit_class: 10 }\r\none.java:115:            .setServer(\"http://127.0.0.1:9090/upsert/rates\");\r\nthree.java:141:    private static final String UPSERT_RATE_PLANS_ENDPOINT = \"/v1/upsert/rateplans\";\r\ntwo.java:43:    private static final String DARI_RATE_PATH = \"/upsert/rates\";\r\n```\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"BurntSushi","id":456674,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NjY3NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/456674?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi","html_url":"https://github.com/BurntSushi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/780/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/780/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
