But I don't know which to pick.\r\n\r\n`-h` is the obvious choice, since that's what grep uses and is likely what everyone is familiar with. Unfortunately, I am 100% unwilling to change the behavior of `-h` today.\r\n\r\nI'd also like to avoid using a short flag that has both lowercase and uppercase variants available. For example, both `-d` and `-D` are unused, which means they could be a convenient way to enable or disable some other feature in the future. Since we already have `-H` to enable file names and can't use `-h`, we should pick a flag that has no chance of being paired with something else.\r\n\r\nFor example, the `-J` flag is available, and its lowercase variant, `-j`, controls parallelism with the number of threads. So `-j` will never need a `-J` to \"negate\" it, making it available. Using this logic and the list above, I think that narrows our choices down to the following:\r\n\r\n```\r\nG\r\nI\r\nJ\r\nO\r\nQ\r\nR\r\nV\r\nW\r\nX\r\nZ\r\n```\r\n\r\nI don't think I see any obvious mnemonic device here between the flags above and `--no-filename`. The only one I can think of is `-I`, which \"comes after `-H` in the alphabet\" and is also the second letter in the word `filename`. grep does have an `-I` flag, but I don't see ripgrep ever needing to add a similar
