What version of ripgrep are you using?\r\n\r\n```\r\nripgrep 13.0.0\r\n-SIMD -AVX (compiled)\r\n+SIMD +AVX (runtime)\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### What operating system are you using ripgrep on?\r\n\r\n`NixOS 22.11 Raccoon`\r\n\r\n#### Describe your bug.\r\n\r\nRipgrep ignores some files through .gitignore that git doesn't ignore.\r\n\r\n#### What are the steps to reproduce the behavior?\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ git clone https://github.com/rust-lang/rust\r\n$ cd rust\r\n$ rg \"Returns an rvalue suitable for use\"\r\ncompiler/rustc_mir_build/src/build/expr/as_rvalue.rs\r\n22:    /// Returns an rvalue suitable for use until the end of the current\r\n$ rg \"Returns an rvalue suitable for use\" compiler/\r\n<nothing>\r\n$ rg \"Returns an rvalue suitable for use\" compiler/rustc_mir_build/src/build/\r\ncompiler/rustc_mir_build/src/build/expr/as_rvalue.rs\r\n22:    /// Returns an rvalue suitable for use until the end of the current\r\n```\r\n\r\nAs you can see, ripgrep doesn't traverse into the `build/` directory, but only if its directory is restricted. I'd put this on .gitignore containing `build/` and ripgrep interpreting that too strongly.\r\n\r\ngit has no problems with the gitignore file, when you do:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ touch compiler/rustc_mir_build/src/build/hello.rs\r\n$ git add compiler/\r\n```\r\n\r\ngit adds that new file.\r\n\r\ngit behaviour is a bit weird here because `build/` is meant to apply to all directories, including non-top-level ones. I'm not sure what the logic in git is but for ripgrep it was a bit unexpected for me. Btw, the file does show up in vscode's search even if you restrict yourself to `compiler/`.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/2498/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/2498/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":9764096139,"node_id":"LE_lADOAzJbyc4tRRO3zwAAAAJF_EiL","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/events/9764096139","actor":{"login":"BurntSushi","id":456674,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NjY3NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/456674?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi","html_url":"https://github.com/BurntSushi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2023-07-08T13:06:14Z","label":{"name":"gitignore","color":"bfdadc"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":9818956851,"node_id":"REFE_lADOAzJbyc4tRRO3zwAAAAJJQWQz","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/events/9818956851","actor":{"login":"sengaya","id":1286668,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyODY2Njg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1286668?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sengaya","html_url":"https://github.com/sengaya","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sengaya/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sengaya/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sengaya/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sengaya/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sengaya/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sengaya/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sengaya/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sengaya/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sengaya/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"b081a5146f5cb36e1eb5fe19ff1b15f5bba325b9","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sengaya/ripgrep/commits/b081a5146f5cb36e1eb5fe19ff1b15f5bba325b9","created_at":"2023-07-14T07:32:57Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":10424451828,"node_id":"REFE_lADOAzJbyc4tRRO3zwAAAAJtWIL0","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/events/10424451828","actor":{"login":"BurntSushi","id":456674,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NjY3NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/456674?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi","html_url":"https://github.com/BurntSushi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"e5f2bf2da0e98af0715dd5aa0d8c61768ad559fb","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/commits/e5f2bf2da0e98af0715dd5aa0d8c61768ad559fb","created_at":"2023-09-20T15:00:20Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":10425087276,"node_id":"CE_lADOAzJbyc4tRRO3zwAAAAJtYjUs","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/events/10425087276","actor":{"login":"BurntSushi","id":456674,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NjY3NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/456674?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi","html_url":"https://github.com/BurntSushi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntS

by `brew bump`\n\n---\n\nCreated with `brew bump-formula-pr`.<details>\n  <summary>release notes</summary>\n  <pre>ripgrep 14 is a new major version release of ripgrep that has some new\r\nfeatures, performance improvements and a lot of bug fixes.\r\n\r\n> In case you haven't heard of it before, ripgrep is a line-oriented search\r\n> tool that recursively searches the current directory for a regex pattern.\r\n> By default, ripgrep will respect gitignore rules and automatically skip\r\n> hidden files/directories and binary files.\r\n\r\nThe headling feature in this release is hyperlink support. In this release,\r\nthey are an opt-in feature but may change to an opt-out feature in the future.\r\nTo enable them, try passing `--hyperlink-format default`. If you use [VS Code],\r\nthen try passing `--hyperlink-format vscode`. Please [report your experience\r\nwith hyperlinks][report-hyperlinks], positive or negative.\r\n\r\n[VS Code]: https://code.visualstudio.com/\r\n[report-hyperlinks]: https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/discussions/2611\r\n\r\nAnother headling development in this release is that it contains a rewrite of\r\nits regex engine. You generally shouldn't notice any changes, except for some\r\nsearches may get faster. You can read more about the [regex engine rewrite on\r\nmy blog][regex-internals]. Please [report your performance improvements or\r\nregressions that you notice][report-perf].\r\n\r\n[report-perf]: https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/discussions/2652\r\n\r\nFinally, ripgrep switched the library it uses for argument parsing. Users\r\nshould not notice a difference in most cases (error messages have changed\r\nsomewhat), but flag overrides should generally be more consistent. For example,\r\nthings like `--no-ignore --ignore-vcs` work as one would expect (disables all\r\nfiltering related to ignore rules except for rules found in version control\r\nsystems such as `git`).\r\n\r\n[regex-internals]: https://blog.burntsushi.net/regex-internals/\r\n\r\n**BREAKING CHANGES**:\r\n\r\n* `rg -C1 -A2` used to be equivalent to `rg -A2`, but now it is equivalent to\r\n  `rg -B1 -A2`. That is, `-A` and `-B` no longer completely override `-C`.\r\n  Instead, they only partially override `-C`.\r\n\r\nBuild process changes:\r\n\r\n* ripgrep's shell completions and man page are now created by running ripgrep\r\nwith a new `--generate` flag. For example, `rg --generate man` will write a\r\nman page in `roff` format on stdout. The release archives have not changed.\r\n* The optional build dependency on `asciidoc` or `asciidoctor` has been\r\ndropped. Previously, it was used to produce ripgrep's man page. ripgrep now\r\nowns this process itself by writing `roff` directly.\r\n\r\nPerformance improvements:\r\n\r\n* [PERF #1746](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/1746):\r\n  Make some cases with inner literals faster.\r\n* [PERF #1760](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/1760):\r\n  Make most searches with `\\b` look-arounds (among others) much faster.\r\n* [PERF #2591](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/pull/2591):\r\n  Parallel directory traversal now uses work stealing for faster searches.\r\n* [PERF #2642](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/pull/2642):\r\n  Parallel directory traversal has some contention reduced.\r\n\r\nFeature enhancements:\r\n\r\n* Added or improved file type filtering for Ada, DITA, Elixir, Fuchsia, Gentoo,\r\n  Gradle, GraphQL, Markdown, Prolog, Raku, TypeScript, USD, V\r\n* [FEATURE #665](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/665):\r\n  Add a new `--hyperlink-format` flag that turns file paths into hyperlinks.\r\n* [FEATURE #1709](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/1709):\r\n  Improve documentation of ripgrep's behavior when stdout is a tty.\r\n* [FEATURE #1737](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/1737):\r\n  Provide binaries for Apple silicon.\r\n* [FEATURE #1790](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/1790):\r\n  Add new `--stop-on-nonmatch` flag.\r\n* [FEATURE #1814](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/1814):\r\n  Flags are now categorized in `-h/--help` output and ripgrep's man page.\r\n* [FEATURE #1838](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/1838):\r\n  An error is shown when searching for NUL bytes with binary detection enabled.\r\n* [FEATURE #2195](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/2195):\r\n  When `extra-verbose` mode is enabled in zsh, show extra file type info.\r\n* [FEATURE #2298](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/2298):\r\n  Add instructions for installing ripgrep using `cargo binstall`.\r\n* [FEATURE #2409](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/pull/2409):\r\n  Added installation instructions for `winget`.\r\n* [FEATURE #2425](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/pull/2425):\r\n  Shell completions (and man page) can be created via `rg --generate`.\r\n* [FEATURE #2524](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/2524):\r\n  The `--debug` flag now indicates whether stdin or `./` is being searched.\r\n* [FEATURE #2643](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/2643):\r\n  Make `-d` a short flag for `--max-depth`.\r\n* [FEATURE #2645](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/2645):\r\n  The `--version` output will now also contain PCRE2 availability information.\r\n\r\nBug fixes:\r\n\r\n* [BUG

Please tick this box to confirm you have reviewed the above.\n\n- [X] I have a different issue.\n\n### What version of ripgrep are you using?\n\nripgrep 14.1.0\r\n\r\nfeatures:-simd-accel,+pcre2\r\nsimd(compile):+SSE2,-SSSE3,-AVX2\r\nsimd(runtime):+SSE2,+SSSE3,+AVX2\r\n\r\nPCRE2 10.42 is available (JIT is available)\n\n### How did you install ripgrep?\n\npacman\n\n### What operating system are you using ripgrep on?\n\narchlinux\n\n### Describe your bug.\n\nIf you have an ignore rule like \"/a/*/b\" in .ignore or .gitignore,  then it will ignore files it shouldn't if you are in a subdirectory that has a grandchild named b. \r\n\r\nSee also https://github.com/sharkdp/fd/issues/1506\n\n### What are the steps to reproduce the behavior?\n\nCreate a directory with a layout like:\r\n```\r\n.\r\n└── a\r\n    ├── c\r\n    │   └── b\r\n    │       └── foo\r\n    └── src\r\n        └── f\r\n            └── b\r\n                └── foo\r\n\r\n7 directories, 2 files\r\n```\r\nand at the top level create a .ignore file with the folowing contents:\r\n```\r\n/a/*/b\r\n```\r\n\r\nFrom the root run `rg --files`\r\nthen run `rg --files` from the a/src directory (either cd into that directory or supply it as the path)\n\n### What is the actual behavior?\n\nWhen run from the root folder, it works as expected and finds a/src/f/b/foo but not a/c/b/foo (because `*` only matches a single directory). \r\n\r\nHowever, if I run from `a/src` then it doesn't find any files. \r\n\r\nPossibly related, if I run `rg --files` from the `a/` folder, then it actually finds both foo files, even though a/c/b/foo _should_ be excluded because of it's relation to the folder containing the .ignore file (and the ignore pattern is absolute).\n\n### What is the expected behavior?\n\na/src/f/b/foo should not be ignored, regardless of which directory I run `rg` from. \r\n\r\na/c/b/foo should be ignored, regardless of which directory I run `rg` from.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/2747/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/2747/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"actor":{"login":"WalterScottYoung","id":28637833,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4NjM3ODMz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/28637833?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/WalterScottYoung","html_url":"https://github.com/WalterScottYoung","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WalterScottYoung/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WalterScottYoung/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WalterScottYoung/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WalterScottYoung/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WalterScottYoung/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WalterScottYoung/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WalterScottYoung/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WalterScottYoung/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WalterScottYoung/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-11-15T11:44:54Z","updated_at":"2024-11-15T11:44:54Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/2933","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/2933/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/2933/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/2933/events","html_url":"https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/pull/2933","id":2661727359,"node_id":"PR_kwDOAzJbyc6CCSL0","number":2933,"title":"ignore:
