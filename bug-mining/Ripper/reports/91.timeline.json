We can just increase the minor version. The aren't many people using this crate yet, so we should feel free to be a bit liberal.\r\n\r\nWith that said, I would rather take cues from std, which defines Stdout and Stderr concrete types. Programmers can write generic code over Write.\r\n\r\nFor termcolor, I don't see why the same can't be done. There is already a WriteColor trait that Stdout satisfies, and which Stderr should also satisfy.

IMO it would have been better if the `std::io` interface had used an enum like the `StandardStreamType` I suggested and a single function returning a single type rather than the pairs of `stdout() -> Stdout` and `stderr() -> Stderr`. The underlying functionality is complete identical except for a different FD/HANDLE number; but because the functions' return values are two separate types, all code that could work with both (that does anything beyond the Write trait) needs to special-case both.\r\n\r\nPoint 2: As for the value of adding some ability to abstract between the two, I think it's like you said in the PR: concrete types are preferable when possible. Consider the `BufferWriter` struct, for instance. It currently starts with:\r\n\r\n```\r\npub struct BufferWriter {\r\n   stdout: LossyStdout<io::Stdout>,\r\n   ...\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nHow to you adapt it to handle either stdout or stderr? You can stick an enum in there .... or you can create parallel `StdoutBufferWriter` and `StderrBufferWriter` structs ... but it seem to me that it'd be vastly preferable to be able to keep the structure non-generic, and not start creating parallel families of structs that only differ in `s/stdout/stderr/`. It's too late to undo the choices in `std::io`, but they can at least be covered up.","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/comments/272756897/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"pkgw","id":59598,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5NTk4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/59598?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pkgw","html_url":"https://github.com/pkgw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pkgw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pkgw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pkgw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pkgw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pkgw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pkgw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pkgw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pkgw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pkgw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":926745229,"node_id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDkyNjc0NTIyOQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/events/926745229","actor":{"login":"BurntSushi","id":456674,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NjY3NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/456674?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi","html_url":"https://github.com/BurntSushi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2017-01-18T00:44:48Z","label":{"name":"question","color":"cc317c"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/comments/276817449","html_url":"https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/324#issuecomment-276817449","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/324","id":276817449,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI3NjgxNzQ0OQ==","user":{"login":"pkgw","id":59598,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5NTk4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/59598?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pkgw","html_url":"https://github.com/pkgw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pkgw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pkgw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pkgw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pkgw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pkgw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pkgw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pkgw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pkgw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pkgw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-02-01T23:29:27Z","updated_at":"2017-02-01T23:29:27Z","body":"Any thoughts about what approach you think would work best?

Ignoring the example of `std` I think every API designer would say that \"stdout\" and \"stderr\" should be different *instances* of a type but not different *types*.
