Specifically:\n\nhttps://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/blob/f05549d7be238c622c516bc574dd7aa174a87f3a/crates/printer/src/summary.rs#L756-L774\n\nBasically what's happening is that ripgrep is trying to preserve the intended semantics of binary filtering. When you use `-l/--files-with-matches`, ripgrep can _immediately_ stop searching once a match is found. Thus, ripgrep never even reads the binary data. But with `-c/--count`, ripgrep has to search the entire thing, which means it will see the binary data.\n\n> additionally, there's a related inconsistency where rg 'cat' -c and rg 'cat' -c file1.txt file2.txt produce different results\n> \n> the procedure of reproducing the behavior is same as mentioned above by the issue writer , with these additional commands\n> \n> **Command:**\n> \n> rg 'cat' -c .\n> \n> **Output:**\n> \n> ```\n> file2.txt:1\n> ```\n> \n> **Command:**\n> \n> rg 'cat' -c file1.txt file2.txt\n> \n> **Output:**\n> \n> ```\n> file2.txt:1\n> file1.txt:1\n> ```\n\nThis is also expected since whenever you pass files explicitly to ripgrep, all filtering, including binary filtering, is disabled.

`--binary`.","author_association":"OWNER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/comments/3321488670/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"BurntSushi","id":456674,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NjY3NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/456674?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi","html_url":"https://github.com/BurntSushi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":19850729489,"node_id":"REFE_lADOAzJbyc7HR4sNzwAAAASfMhgR","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/events/19850729489","actor":{"login":"BurntSushi","id":456674,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NjY3NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/456674?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi","html_url":"https://github.com/BurntSushi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"9296035850d230ee987ab9c57dc50059e0b3a234","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/commits/9296035850d230ee987ab9c57dc50059e0b3a234","created_at":"2025-09-22T21:05:54Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"actor":{"login":"BurntSushi","id":456674,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NjY3NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/456674?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi","html_url":"https://github.com/BurntSushi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-09-22T21:05:55Z","updated_at":"2025-09-22T21:05:55Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/3157","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/3157/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/3157/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/3157/events","html_url":"https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/pull/3157","id":3442772435,"node_id":"PR_kwDOAzJbyc6p8Odu","number":3157,"title":"cli:

can understand marking this as wontfix. From a UX POV, perhaps showing no matches at all for a file is more of a \"fail fast\" approach than showing an incorrect number of matches, so users might realize they need `-a` sooner. \n\nThat said, I want try framing this another way and see if it sticks. The inconsistency is not only between `-l` and `-c`, it's also between `-c` and no options: when searching normally rg will output all the matches it found up until it detects binary but with `-c` the previously displayed match(es) not show up in the count. Seems then that `-c` is the odd one out with both `-l` and normal search acting as if the file were truncated past the first binary detection where `-c` acts as if the file doesn't exist at all. In my mind, `-c` is roughly like piping the output of a normal search through `wc -l` on a per-file basis, and preserving the current behavior breaks that model (maybe this warrants some tweaks to #3157 at least).\n\nWhatever you decide, thanks for taking a look at this issue and for your work on this tool generally","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/comments/3321818737/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"ejh3","id":7369146,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjczNjkxNDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7369146?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ejh3","html_url":"https://github.com/ejh3","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ejh3/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ejh3/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ejh3/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ejh3/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ejh3/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ejh3/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ejh3/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ejh3/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ejh3/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/comments/3321919708","html_url":"https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/3131#issuecomment-3321919708","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/3131","id":3321919708,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAzJbyc7GAHjc","user":{"login":"BurntSushi","id":456674,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NjY3NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/456674?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi","html_url":"https://github.com/BurntSushi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-09-22T23:49:58Z","updated_at":"2025-09-22T23:51:15Z","body":"I appreciate that, but the inconsistency there isn't really avoidable either. Namely, the binary data occurs late enough in the file that a match has already been printed. ripgrep can't just back up and avoid it. The `-c` flag is a \"summary\" output, which means nothing gets printed until the entire file has been searched. And yes indeed, this is a fail fast approach. That is, I think it's better to not emit anything than to emit what could be an incorrect count.\n\nNotably, grep behaves the same as ripgrep here (ripgrep's behavior is like GNU grep's `-I` flag):\n\n```\n$ grep -r -c -I 'cat' ./\n./file1.txt:0\n./file2.txt:1\n$ grep -r -l -I 'cat' ./\n./file1.txt\n./file2.txt\n$ grep -r -I 'cat' ./\n./file1.txt:cat here\n./file2.txt:cat here\n```\n\nAnd

release of ripgrep that mostly has bug fixes,\r\nsome minor performance improvements and minor new features.\r\n\r\n> In case you haven't heard of it before, ripgrep is a line-oriented search\r\n> tool that recursively searches the current directory for a regex pattern.\r\n> By default, ripgrep will respect gitignore rules and automatically skip\r\n> hidden files/directories and binary files.\r\n\r\nHere are some highlights:\r\n\r\n* Several bugs around gitignore matching have been fixed. This includes\r\n  a commonly reported bug related to applying gitignore rules from parent\r\n  directories.\r\n* A memory usage regression when handling very large gitignore files has been\r\n  fixed.\r\n* `rg -vf file`, where `file` is empty, now matches everything.\r\n* The `-r/--replace` flag now works with `--json`.\r\n* A subset of Jujutsu (`jj`) repositories are now treated as if they were git\r\n  repositories. That is, ripgrep will respect `jj`'s gitignores.\r\n* Globs can now use nested curly braces.\r\n\r\nPlatform support:\r\n\r\n* `aarch64` for Windows now has release artifacts.\r\n* `powerpc64` no longer has release artifacts generated for it. The CI\r\n  release workflow stopped working, and I didn't deem it worth my time to\r\n  debug it. If someone wants this and can test it, I'd be happy to add it\r\n  back.\r\n* ripgrep binaries are now compiled with full LTO enabled. You may notice\r\n  small performance improvements from this and a modest decrease in binary\r\n  size.\r\n\r\nPerformance improvements:\r\n\r\n* [PERF #2111](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/2111):\r\n  Don't resolve helper binaries on Windows when `-z/--search-zip` isn't used.\r\n* [PERF #2865](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/pull/2865):\r\n  Avoid using path canonicalization on Windows when emitting hyperlinks.\r\n* [PERF #3184](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/pull/3184):\r\n  Improve performance of large values with `-A/--after-context`.\r\n\r\nBug fixes:\r\n\r\n* [BUG
