So I assume the Svelte compiler does treat `.svelte.ts` files differently to `.ts` files to get that reactivity we would normally only be able to use in `.svelte` files.\n\nSvelte developers move a lot of state management that as of Svelte 5, primarily relies on runes, to `x.svelte.ts` files. So I personally believe from a UX perspective it would make sense to combine them. Though I understand ripgrep is a tool that isn't in particular about any framework or technology, I know that if you add `-tts` you will also get `.tsx` results which are an extended typescript format.\n\nSo I defer it to your better judgement, though thank you for the last tip - I was unaware and think that doing that could be good enough.

The fact that Svelte stuff can be \"inside\" `.svelte.ts` makes sense, but that's true of a ton of stuff. For example, you can find Markdown inside of `*.rs` files. There's all sorts of examples of file types that can \"contain\" other file types.\n\nI absolutely could be wrong here.\n\nIn particular, one thing that strikes me as different here is that `svelte` does actually appear in the file extension. Maybe that should move the needle?\n\nSo how about we do this provisionally.
