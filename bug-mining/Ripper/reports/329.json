extract till last 'o' in the line, if there are no more whitespaces after 'o'\r\n$ # the issue is that characters after 'o' are also displayed despite the -o switch\r\n$ rg -NoP '.*o(?!.*\\s)' ip.txt\r\nxoyz\r\ncat\tdog\r\n\r\n$ # works if I replace \\s with space/tab character class or use GNU grep\r\n$ # using \\s(?!$) instead of \\s is another workaround that works\r\n$ rg -NoP '.*o(?!.*[ \\t])' ip.txt\r\nxo\r\ncat\tdo\r\n$ grep -oP '.*o(?!.*\\s)' ip.txt\r\nxo\r\ncat\tdo\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnother example shown below:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ rg -No '.*\\s' ip.txt\r\nfoo \r\ncat\t\r\n\r\n$ rg -NoP '.*\\s' ip.txt\r\nfoo 42\r\ncat\tdog\r\n```\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"BurntSushi","id":456674,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NjY3NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/456674?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi","html_url":"https://github.com/BurntSushi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/1401/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/1401/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
