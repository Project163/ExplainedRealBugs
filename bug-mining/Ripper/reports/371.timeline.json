by `brew bump`\n\n---\n\nCreated with `brew bump-formula-pr`.<details>\n  <summary>release notes</summary>\n  <pre>ripgrep 14 is a new major version release of ripgrep that has some new\r\nfeatures, performance improvements and a lot of bug fixes.\r\n\r\n> In case you haven't heard of it before, ripgrep is a line-oriented search\r\n> tool that recursively searches the current directory for a regex pattern.\r\n> By default, ripgrep will respect gitignore rules and automatically skip\r\n> hidden files/directories and binary files.\r\n\r\nThe headling feature in this release is hyperlink support. In this release,\r\nthey are an opt-in feature but may change to an opt-out feature in the future.\r\nTo enable them, try passing `--hyperlink-format default`. If you use [VS Code],\r\nthen try passing `--hyperlink-format vscode`. Please [report your experience\r\nwith hyperlinks][report-hyperlinks], positive or negative.\r\n\r\n[VS Code]: https://code.visualstudio.com/\r\n[report-hyperlinks]: https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/discussions/2611\r\n\r\nAnother headling development in this release is that it contains a rewrite of\r\nits regex engine. You generally shouldn't notice any changes, except for some\r\nsearches may get faster. You can read more about the [regex engine rewrite on\r\nmy blog][regex-internals]. Please [report your performance improvements or\r\nregressions that you notice][report-perf].\r\n\r\n[report-perf]: https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/discussions/2652\r\n\r\nFinally, ripgrep switched the library it uses for argument parsing. Users\r\nshould not notice a difference in most cases (error messages have changed\r\nsomewhat), but flag overrides should generally be more consistent. For example,\r\nthings like `--no-ignore --ignore-vcs` work as one would expect (disables all\r\nfiltering related to ignore rules except for rules found in version control\r\nsystems such as `git`).\r\n\r\n[regex-internals]: https://blog.burntsushi.net/regex-internals/\r\n\r\n**BREAKING CHANGES**:\r\n\r\n* `rg -C1 -A2` used to be equivalent to `rg -A2`, but now it is equivalent to\r\n  `rg -B1 -A2`. That is, `-A` and `-B` no longer completely override `-C`.\r\n  Instead, they only partially override `-C`.\r\n\r\nBuild process changes:\r\n\r\n* ripgrep's shell completions and man page are now created by running ripgrep\r\nwith a new `--generate` flag. For example, `rg --generate man` will write a\r\nman page in `roff` format on stdout. The release archives have not changed.\r\n* The optional build dependency on `asciidoc` or `asciidoctor` has been\r\ndropped. Previously, it was used to produce ripgrep's man page. ripgrep now\r\nowns this process itself by writing `roff` directly.\r\n\r\nPerformance improvements:\r\n\r\n* [PERF #1746](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/1746):\r\n  Make some cases with inner literals faster.\r\n* [PERF #1760](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/1760):\r\n  Make most searches with `\\b` look-arounds (among others) much faster.\r\n* [PERF #2591](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/pull/2591):\r\n  Parallel directory traversal now uses work stealing for faster searches.\r\n* [PERF #2642](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/pull/2642):\r\n  Parallel directory traversal has some contention reduced.\r\n\r\nFeature enhancements:\r\n\r\n* Added or improved file type filtering for Ada, DITA, Elixir, Fuchsia, Gentoo,\r\n  Gradle, GraphQL, Markdown, Prolog, Raku, TypeScript, USD, V\r\n* [FEATURE #665](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/665):\r\n  Add a new `--hyperlink-format` flag that turns file paths into hyperlinks.\r\n* [FEATURE #1709](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/1709):\r\n  Improve documentation of ripgrep's behavior when stdout is a tty.\r\n* [FEATURE #1737](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/1737):\r\n  Provide binaries for Apple silicon.\r\n* [FEATURE

#2409](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/pull/2409):\r\n  Added installation instructions for `winget`.\r\n* [FEATURE #2425](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/pull/2425):\r\n  Shell completions (and man page) can be created via `rg --generate`.\r\n* [FEATURE #2524](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/2524):\r\n  The `--debug` flag now indicates whether stdin or `./` is being searched.\r\n* [FEATURE #2643](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/2643):\r\n  Make `-d` a short flag for `--max-depth`.\r\n* [FEATURE #2645](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/2645):\r\n  The `--version` output will now also contain PCRE2 availability information.\r\n\r\nBug fixes:\r\n\r\n* [BUG
