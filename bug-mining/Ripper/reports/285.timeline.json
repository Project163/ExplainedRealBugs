I _also_ made it so the `-u/--no-ignore` flag implied `--no-ignore-files`. To me that \"makes sense\" in that it's consistent with `-u` implying every other `--no-ignore-*` flag.\r\n\r\nThe main problem I have with doing that is that it's a breaking change, and it's kind of a severe one. If I were starting over, then yeah, I'd probably make `-u` imply `--no-ignore-files`.\r\n\r\nI'm generally okay with making breaking changes, but there really needs to be an easy way to capture the old workflow. i.e., It should be possible to do, say, `rg -u --ignore-files <blah blah>` in order to cause ripgrep to stop respecting all ignore rules _except_ for `--ignore-file` flags, which is the status quo today. But the problem with doing that is that `rg -u --ignore-files -u <blah blah>` doesn't work like you'd expect it to: the second `-u` will _not_ override `--ignore-files`. This is partially because ripgrep's argv parser doesn't support doing this in a simple way, partially because the other `--ignore-*` flags don't work like this and partially because it just makes ripgrep's flags overall more complicated.\r\n\r\nSo... it's not a great solution, but it's something. I might suggest `alias rgu=\"rg -u --no-ignore-files\"` to suppress all ignore related logic.\r\n\r\nI am open to doing a breaking change in the future, but I'd like to see a simpler way of re-capturing existing behavior. Perhaps that needs to wait until our argv handling can become more robust with respect to flag overrides. (This particular issue about overrides comes up quite a bit. See #809 for example, which actually motivated [clap to add new APIs for that purpose](https://docs.rs/clap/2.33.0/clap/struct.ArgMatches.html#method.indices_of). But I just haven't gotten around to building an abstraction that's easy to understand that uses them
