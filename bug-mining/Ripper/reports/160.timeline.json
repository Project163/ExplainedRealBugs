What version of ripgrep are you using?\r\n\r\nripgrep 11.0.2 (rev 3de31f7527)\r\n-SIMD -AVX (compiled)\r\n+SIMD +AVX (runtime)\r\n\r\n#### How did you install ripgrep?\r\n\r\nfrom apt\r\n\r\n#### What operating system are you using ripgrep on?\r\n\r\nUbuntu 18.04\r\n\r\n#### Describe your question, feature request, or bug.\r\n\r\nThis seems like it could be a bug. If it's the intended behavior, it's kind of non-intuitive.\r\nSearching with `--hidden` and `--ignore-vcs` includes the `.git/` folder in results.\r\nSimilar to issue #807, which looks like it _was_ a bug.\r\n\r\n#### If this is a bug, what are the steps to reproduce the behavior?\r\n\r\nIn a git repo (ie, a folder with a `.git/` subfolder):\r\n\r\n* If you run `rg --files`, it will list the files as expected: no hidden files, nothing from .gitignore, and no `.git/` directory since \"ignore VCS\" is enabled by default.\r\n\r\n* If you run `rg --files --ignore-vcs`, it's the same as above, again because \"ignore VCS\" is enabled by default.\r\n\r\n* if you add the \"hidden flag\" and run: `rg --files --hidden --ignore-vcs`, it will include the contents of the hidden `.git/` directory, even though it's one of the paths that should still be ignored by the \"ignore VCS\" option.\r\n\r\n#### If this is a bug, what is the actual behavior?\r\n\r\n`--hidden` takes precedence over `--ignore-vcs` and the search includes `.git/`\r\n\r\nOutput from an example directory: `rg --hidden --files --ignore-vcs --debug`\r\n\r\n```\r\nDEBUG|rg::config|src/config.rs:40: /home/duncan/.ripgreprc: arguments loaded from config file: []\r\nDEBUG|globset|globset/src/lib.rs:430: glob converted to regex: Glob { glob: \"**/*~\", re: \"(?-u)^(?:/?|.*/)[^/]*\\\\~$\", opts: GlobOptions { case_insensitive: false, literal_separator: true, backslash_escape: true }, tokens: Tokens([RecursivePrefix, ZeroOrMore, Literal('~')]) }\r\nDEBUG|globset|globset/src/lib.rs:430: glob converted to regex: Glob { glob: \"**/._*\", re: \"(?-u)^(?:/?|.*/)\\\\._[^/]*$\", opts: GlobOptions { case_insensitive: false, literal_separator: true, backslash_escape: true }, tokens: Tokens([RecursivePrefix, Literal('.'), Literal('_'), ZeroOrMore]) }\r\nDEBUG|globset|globset/src/lib.rs:430: glob converted to regex: Glob { glob: \"**/.smbdelete*\", re: \"(?-u)^(?:/?|.*/)\\\\.smbdelete[^/]*$\", opts: GlobOptions { case_insensitive: false, literal_separator: true, backslash_escape: true }, tokens: Tokens([RecursivePrefix, Literal('.'), Literal('s'), Literal('m'), Literal('b'), Literal('d'), Literal('e'), Literal('l'), Literal('e'), Literal('t'), Literal('e'), ZeroOrMore]) }\r\nDEBUG|globset|globset/src/lib.rs:430: glob converted to regex: Glob { glob: \"**/.v8flags.*\", re: \"(?-u)^(?:/?|.*/)\\\\.v8flags\\\\.[^/]*$\", opts: GlobOptions { case_insensitive: false, literal_separator: true, backslash_escape: true }, tokens: Tokens([RecursivePrefix, Literal('.'), Literal('v'), Literal('8'), Literal('f'), Literal('l'), Literal('a'), Literal('g'), Literal('s'), Literal('.'), ZeroOrMore]) }\r\nDEBUG|globset|globset/src/lib.rs:435: built glob set; 0 literals, 5 basenames, 0 extensions, 0 prefixes, 0 suffixes, 0 required extensions, 4 regexes\r\nhello.txt\r\nfoobar.js\r\n.git/config\r\n.git/HEAD\r\n.git/description\r\n.git/hooks/post-update.sample\r\n.git/hooks/update.sample\r\n.git/hooks/commit-msg.sample\r\n.git/hooks/pre-push.sample\r\n.git/hooks/pre-applypatch.sample\r\n.git/hooks/pre-commit.sample\r\n.git/hooks/applypatch-msg.sample\r\n.git/hooks/pre-receive.sample\r\n.git/hooks/fsmonitor-watchman.sample\r\n.git/hooks/prepare-commit-msg.sample\r\n.git/hooks/pre-rebase.sample\r\n.git/info/exclude\r\n```\r\n\r\n(I created a simple git repo with a couple files and commented everything out of my .ripgreprc file)\r\n\r\n#### If this is a bug, what is the expected behavior?\r\n\r\n`.git/` and other VCS-related things should still not be searched unless `--no-ignore-vcs` is explicitly set. \r\n\r\nWhile the `.git/` dir isn't technically something from `.gitignore`, it's still ignored as part of the \"ignore VCS\" flag, so I'd expect it to still be ignored, regardless of the settings for hidden files.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/1509/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/1509/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
