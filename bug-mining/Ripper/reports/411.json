There's a `threads` parameter which I left unspecified (using `WalkBuilder`):\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/blob/71d71d2d98964653cdfcfa315802f518664759d7/crates/ignore/src/walk.rs#L1196\r\n\r\nThe docs say if left unspecified, aka at `0`, the number of threads will be picked based on heuristics:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/blob/71d71d2d98964653cdfcfa315802f518664759d7/crates/ignore/src/walk.rs#L643-L644\r\n\r\n\n\n### What are the steps to reproduce the behavior?\n\nExecute\r\n\r\n```rust\r\nignore::WalkBuilder::new(&some_path)\r\n        .build_parallel()\r\n        .run(todo!())\r\n```\n\n### What is the actual behavior?\n\nUsing these settings, I noticed my application using 200% CPU, where more cores would have been available. \n\n### What is the expected behavior?\n\nProcessing to use more threads, as determined by the heuristics.\r\n\r\nIt turns out, `threads` is hard-coded to 2 if unspecified:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/blob/71d71d2d98964653cdfcfa315802f518664759d7/crates/ignore/src/walk.rs#L1307-L1308\r\n\r\nwhere for the 'heuristic', I expected something along the lines of `num_cpus`. I can confirm setting `threads` to [`num_cpus::get()`](https://docs.rs/num_cpus/latest/num_cpus/fn.get.html), 12 in my case, yields results as expected.\r\n\r\nCould/should this be used as the heuristic? It is a substantial, free win in my case.\r\n\r\nIf not, then the docs should probably be adjusted.","closed_by":{"login":"BurntSushi","id":456674,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NjY3NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/456674?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi","html_url":"https://github.com/BurntSushi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BurntSushi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/2854/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/BurntSushi/ripgrep/issues/2854/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
