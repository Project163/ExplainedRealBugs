corpus \r\n(no matches)\r\n```\r\n\r\ntreating patterns as non fixed string finds a match:\r\n```\r\n$ rg -f patterns corpus \r\n1:1.208.0.0/12\r\n```\r\n\r\nand strangely, removing a single line from

result of 39 vs 40 lines, or if it's 39 vs 40 lines and the size of the '1.208.0.0/12' string, but I do seem to be crossing some boundary into buggy behavior with this specific
