description includes \"fixes #xxxx\", or\r\n\"closes #xxxx\"\r\n\r\nPlease provide the following information:\r\n-->\r\n\r\n**- What I did**\r\nAdded `--all` to `docker kill`. This allows a user to easily send a signal to all running containers. \r\n\r\n**- How I did it**\r\nI had made a new func `RequiresArgOrAllFlag` which makes sure a cmd has either args passed to it or has the `--all` flag set. This will be especially useful should `stop` and `rm` get an `--all` flag. Other than that I used the functionality of `ps` to get the containers using the `status=running` filter.\r\n\r\n**- How to verify it**\r\nI added new unit test file to cover the `kill --all` functionality as well as the already existing `kill` functionality.\r\n\r\nfunctionality looks like this:\r\n```bash\r\n$ for i in $(seq 3); do docker run -itd alpine sh; done;\r\nb776410ee32895527d804ec7ee08ca7d3ef20c9a4fefc1ebe1384cbfdf8bd051\r\n56245ce81708d8d3eae8c7bc920f353deb2bb6b62d2fa8668b3ebc8ba2c6581e\r\nbd8a998578173134eed2266d51572f861bea3f33aa79b2292a967052329c8b7e\r\n$ docker kill --all\r\nb776410ee32895527d804ec7ee08ca7d3ef20c9a4fefc1ebe1384cbfdf8bd051\r\n56245ce81708d8d3eae8c7bc920f353deb2bb6b62d2fa8668b3ebc8ba2c6581e\r\nbd8a998578173134eed2266d51572f861bea3f33aa79b2292a967052329c8b7e\r\n$ docker kill --all -s SIGINT\r\nno containers running to send SIGINT signal to\r\n$ docker kill --all some-container\r\n\"docker kill\" requires at least 1 argument or --all flag.\r\nSee 'docker kill --help'.\r\n\r\nUsage:  docker kill [OPTIONS] CONTAINER [CONTAINER...]\r\n\r\nKill one or more running containers\r\n```\r\n\r\n**- Description for the changelog**\r\n<!--\r\nWrite a short (one line) summary that describes the changes in this\r\npull request for inclusion in the changelog:\r\n-->\r\nIntroduce  `kill --all` to send a signal to all running containers\r\n\r\nFixes https://github.com/docker/cli/issues/3565\r\n\r\n***Additional Information***\r\nI decided not to make a `rm --all` like the issue conversation suggests because I think there might be a functionality conflict. `docker container prune` requires either a confirmation or a `--force` flag. I think that making `docker rm --all` remove all containers without confirmation could lead to an unpredictable experience for the end user. I'd be open to suggestions, but I'm not sure if it is necessary given `docker prune` exists. Maybe I'm missing something; I would be happy to hear your thoughts about this and about `docker stop --all` :smiley: \r\n\r\n\r\n**- A picture of a cute animal (not mandatory but

Description\r\n\r\nI’d like to suggest adding an `-a, --all` option to the `docker rm` command. With this we could do commands like `docker rm --all --force`. It would allow us to remove all containers, both running and stopped, with a single command. Currently, we have to stop them first and then remove them, which feels a bit clunky.\r\n\r\nPodman has this functionality built in. Adding this option to Docker would streamline the process and improve the user experience.\r\n\r\n### References\r\n\r\n- https://docs.docker.com/reference/cli/docker/container/rm/\r\n- https://docs.podman.io/en/latest/markdown/podman-rm.1.html\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/docker/cli/issues/5479/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/docker/cli/issues/5479/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
