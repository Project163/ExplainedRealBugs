to reproduce the issue to check if it's still current;\r\n\r\n```bash\r\ndocker service create --name foo nginx:alpine\r\ndocker service update foo --health-start-period 2m\r\n```\r\n\r\nInspecting in the default (JSON) format:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\ndocker service inspect foo | grep -i health -n2  \r\n                    \"Init\": false,\r\n16-                    \"StopGracePeriod\":
