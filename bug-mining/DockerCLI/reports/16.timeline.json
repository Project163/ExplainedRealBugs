What I did**\r\n\r\nI arranged to cli plugins include in the output of `docker --badopt`, fixes #1813.\r\n\r\nIn the process of writing the e2e test I also noticed that the `docker --badopt` unconditionally included experimental (builtin) commands so I fixed that too.\r\n\r\nFinally since I was adding a new subtest to an existing test, I took the chance to use `t.Run` for all of the subtests.\r\n\r\n**- How I did it**\r\n\r\nIncluding cli plugins is achieved by calling `pluginmanager.AddPluginCommandStubs` in the flag errro callback function. Handling experimental commands properly is handled by calling `hideUnsupportedFeatures` in the same callback.\r\n\r\n**- How to verify it**\r\n\r\nThere is a new e2e test.\r\n\r\n**- Description for the changelog**\r\n\r\n* Help output now always includes CLI plugins.\r\n\r\n/cc

load plugins for invalid flags\r\n\r\nOn Docker CLI versions before v28.0.0, using an unknown flag would print\r\nthe usage output, showing all available top-level flags and commands;\r\n\r\n    docker --badopt\r\n    unknown flag: --badopt\r\n    See 'docker --help'.\r\n    \r\n    Usage:  docker [OPTIONS] COMMAND\r\n    \r\n    A self-sufficient runtime for containers\r\n    \r\n    Options:\r\n          --config string      Location of client config files (default \"/root/.docker\")\r\n    ...\r\n\r\nThis output did not include plugin-commands, making the usage output\r\nincomplete. That issue was fixed in [cli@40a6cf7], which loaded all\r\navailable cli-plugins, so that a stub was created for printing the\r\nplugin commands in the usage output. Similarly, [cli@79a75da] added\r\ncode to hide experimental commands and commands not supported by the\r\ndaemon.\r\n\r\nHowever, since 28.0.0 (commit [cli@f28fc7f]), the usage output was\r\nremoved for this error, so loading plugins is no longer needed;\r\n\r\n    docker --badopt\r\n    unknown flag: --badopt\r\n    \r\n    Usage:  docker [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARG...]\r\n    \r\n    Run 'docker --help' for more information\r\n\r\nThis patch removes the code added in [cli@40a6cf7] and [cli@79a75da].\r\n\r\nWith this patch, the output is still the same;\r\n\r\n    docker --unknown-flag buildx ls --no-such\r\n    unknown flag: --unknown-flag\r\n    \r\n    Usage:  docker [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARG...]\r\n    \r\n    Run 'docker --help' for more information\r\n\r\nThis function only handles flags defined by the CLI itself; invalid\r\nflags for plugins are handled by the plugin itself, so are not\r\nimpacted;\r\n\r\n    docker buildx ls --no-such\r\n    unknown flag: --no-such\r\n    \r\n    Usage:  docker buildx ls\r\n    \r\n    Run 'docker buildx ls --help' for more information\r\n\r\n[cli@f28fc7f]: https://github.com/docker/cli/commit/f28fc7f82fc87d0ed521de452b6227cee76fd956\r\n[cli@40a6cf7]: https://github.com/docker/cli/commit/40a6cf7c477cf328134b0b8dcdbd9a09d02f918b\r\n[cli@79a75da]: https://github.com/docker/cli/commit/79a75da0fd97b02311676028c3406b242c785f7c\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nMake sure you've read and understood our contributing guidelines;\r\nhttps://github.com/docker/cli/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md\r\n\r\n** Make sure all your commits include a signature generated with `git commit -s` **\r\n\r\nFor additional information on our contributing process, read our contributing\r\nguide https://docs.docker.com/opensource/code/\r\n\r\nIf this is a bug fix, make sure your description includes \"fixes #xxxx\", or\r\n\"closes #xxxx\"\r\n\r\nProvide the following information:\r\n-->\r\n\r\n**- What I did**\r\n\r\n**- How I did it**\r\n\r\n**- How to verify it**\r\n\r\n**- Human readable description for the release notes**\r\n<!--\r\nWrite a short (one line) summary that describes the changes in this\r\npull request for inclusion in the changelog.\r\nIt must be placed inside the below triple backticks section.\r\n\r\nNOTE: Only fill this section if changes introduced in this PR are user-facing.\r\nThe PR must have a relevant impact/ label.\r\n-->\r\n```markdown changelog\r\n\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n**- A picture of a cute animal (not mandatory but encouraged)**\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/docker/cli/issues/6526/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/docker/cli/issues/6526/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
