I'd like to be able to generate contexts from Terraform configs, but the [archive_file](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/archive/d/archive_file.html) data source only supports outputting zip files.\r\n\r\nIt would be helpful if `docker context import/export` supported zip files for Docker contexts. Or, a flat file config like kubeconfigs (basically the meta.json with certs embedded).\r\n\r\n**Steps to reproduce the issue:**\r\n\r\n1. Create a Docker context as a zip archive.\r\n2.
