The string s can be in IPv4 dotted decimal (\"192.0.2.1\"), IPv6 (\"2001:db8::68\"), or IPv4-mapped IPv6 (\"::ffff:192.0.2.1\") form. If s is not a valid textual representation of an IP address, ParseIP returns nil.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe _could_ relax validation on the client side, and strip the square brackets, but not sure if that's a good idea, as we wouldn't be able to support the same over the API as the daemon-side likely would run into the same issue (which may make things more confusing)\r\n\r\n/cc @akerouanton (in case you

agree the current colon-based format is confusing and supporting square brackets would remove that confusion. We should definitely move away from that format.\r\n\r\nFor the record, [RFC 5952:  A Recommendation for IPv6 Address Text Representation, section 6](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5952.html#section-6), is the only case where the use of square brackets are recommended. That's why `net.ParseIP` doesn't support the bracketed format. But this recommendation exist for quite the same reason as what we face here: having an extra colon hanging around makes it harder (or, for the IP + port text represtation, even impossible in some cases) to understand what's the IP address.\r\n\r\n> We could relax validation on the client side, and strip the square brackets, but not sure if that's a good idea, as we wouldn't be able to support the same over the API as the daemon-side likely would run into the same issue (which may make things more confusing)\r\n\r\nIf we accept to do that, it's only due to the confusion created by the colon seperator we currently have on the CLI. So, I think this change should not slip into the deamon.\r\n\r\nAnd to keep it easy to move from the old, colon-based format to a new, equal-based format, we should support bracketed IP address in both IMO.\r\n\r\nI think that could be a good one for

started looking at this one, and (fun, fun fun!) it looks like this is one of those examples where the UX became part of the API.

request.","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/docker/cli/issues/comments/1808094251/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"thaJeztah","id":1804568,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MDQ1Njg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1804568?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/thaJeztah","html_url":"https://github.com/thaJeztah","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thaJeztah/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thaJeztah/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thaJeztah/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thaJeztah/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thaJeztah/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thaJeztah/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thaJeztah/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thaJeztah/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thaJeztah/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/docker/cli/issues/comments/1812692435","html_url":"https://github.com/docker/cli/issues/4648#issuecomment-1812692435","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/docker/cli/issues/4648","id":1812692435,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBT74_c5sC33T","user":{"login":"robmry","id":148866618,"node_id":"U_kgDOCN-GOg","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/148866618?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/robmry","html_url":"https://github.com/robmry","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robmry/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robmry/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robmry/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robmry/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robmry/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robmry/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robmry/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robmry/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robmry/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-11-15T14:57:20Z","updated_at":"2023-11-15T14:57:20Z","body":"I'll

#4648\r\n\r\n**- What I did**\r\n\r\nMake it easier to specify IPv6 addresses in the '--add-host' option by permitting 'host=ip' in addition to 'host:ip', and allowing square brackets around the address.\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n\r\n    --add-host=hostname:127.0.0.1\r\n    --add-host=hostname:::1\r\n    --add-host=hostname=::1\r\n    --add-host=hostname:[::1]\r\n\r\n**- How I did it**\r\n\r\nTo avoid compatibility problems, the CLI will replace an '=' separator with ':', and strip brackets, before sending the request to the API.\r\n\r\n**- How to verify it**\r\n\r\nNew unit tests pass.\r\n\r\nThe `docker run` command sets up a `/etc/hosts` entry as expected when using '=' and brackets ...\r\n\r\n```\r\n# /usr/local/cli/cli/build/docker run -ti --add-host thishost=[::1] alpine sh\r\n/ # cat /etc/hosts\r\n127.0.0.1       localhost\r\n::1     localhost ip6-localhost ip6-loopback\r\nfe00::0 ip6-localnet\r\nff00::0 ip6-mcastprefix\r\nff02::1 ip6-allnodes\r\nff02::2 ip6-allrouters\r\n::1     thishost\r\n172.18.0.2      43c134b9fad0\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut `docker inspect` still shows the option with a ':' separator and no brackets ...\r\n\r\n```\r\n# /usr/local/cli/cli/build/docker inspect 43 -f '{{ .HostConfig.ExtraHosts }}'\r\n[thishost:::1]\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe same formats work for legacy `docker build`, `buildx` needs a separate change ...\r\n\r\n```\r\nroot@6b6f43dcb70f:/go/src/github.com/docker/docker/a# cat Dockerfile\r\nFROM alpine:latest\r\nRUN ping -c1 something\r\nRUN ping -c1

Fixes docker/cli#4648\r\n- See https://github.com/docker/cli/issues/4648#issuecomment-1807992740\r\n- related: https://github.com/docker/cli/pull/4663\r\n\r\n**- What I did**\r\n\r\nMake it easier to specify IPv6 addresses in the '--add-host' option by permitting 'host=ip' in addition to 'host:ip', and allowing square brackets around the address.\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n\r\n    --add-host=hostname:127.0.0.1\r\n    --add-host=hostname:::1\r\n    --add-host=hostname=::1\r\n    --add-host=hostname:[::1]\r\n\r\n**- How I did it**\r\n\r\nUpdated the function that converts from `--add-host` format to buildx's csv format, stripping brackets from the address.\r\n\r\nThis pull request is equivalent to one in `docker/cli`, for `docker run` and legacy builds.\r\n\r\n**- How to verify it**\r\n\r\nNew unit tests pass.
