Thus extra steps are needed in scripting to avoid this output.\r\n\r\n**Proposal**\r\n\r\nCould `docker kill` and/or `docker stop` have a `-a/--all` flag that terminates any available running containers? I imagine the `-s` flag could be used in combination like `docker kill -a -s SIGQUIT`\r\n\r\nAnother option would be `docker killall` which would allow for more in depth options like `killall`. This isn't necessary for my use case though.\r\n\r\nIf this is a valid feature, I'd like to give it a shot at implementing it 👍 \r\n\r\nThank you","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/docker/cli/issues/3565/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/docker/cli/issues/3565/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
