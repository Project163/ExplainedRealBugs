It's not easy at all to write a command that would work across Linux, macOS and Windows today.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"thaJeztah","id":1804568,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MDQ1Njg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1804568?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/thaJeztah","html_url":"https://github.com/thaJeztah","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thaJeztah/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thaJeztah/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thaJeztah/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thaJeztah/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thaJeztah/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thaJeztah/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thaJeztah/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thaJeztah/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thaJeztah/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/docker/cli/issues/1203/reactions","total_count":61,"+1":61,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/docker/cli/issues/1203/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
