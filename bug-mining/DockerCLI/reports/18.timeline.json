my opinion, it is explicit and makes sense to resolve the path as relative path instead of absolute if the bind mount path starts with a `./`.\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n\r\n```sh\r\ndocker run -v ./data-dump:/app/dump my-image\r\n```\r\n\r\n`./` resolves as relative path in `docker-compose` as well which makes perfect sense and should be supported in docker cli as well imho.","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/docker/cli/issues/comments/410472402/reactions","total_count":48,"+1":48,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"matthewwo","id":2998111,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5OTgxMTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2998111?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthewwo","html_url":"https://github.com/matthewwo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthewwo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthewwo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthewwo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthewwo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthewwo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthewwo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthewwo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthewwo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthewwo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"actor":{"login":"matthewwo","id":2998111,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5OTgxMTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2998111?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthewwo","html_url":"https://github.com/matthewwo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthewwo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthewwo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthewwo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthewwo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthewwo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthewwo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthewwo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthewwo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matthewwo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-08-04T22:13:55Z","updated_at":"2018-08-04T22:13:55Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/docker/cli/issues/1273","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/docker/cli","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/docker/cli/issues/1273/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/docker/cli/issues/1273/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/docker/cli/issues/1273/events","html_url":"https://github.com/docker/cli/pull/1273","id":347651907,"node_id":"MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0MjA2MjEyMTM0","number":1273,"title":"Support

Why do we need this PR?\r\n\r\npreviously, one needed to go through a sequence of manual steps to get\r\nthe integration test running:\r\n\r\n1. build an image\r\n2. create a container from that\r\n2. getting inside the container\r\n3. run the tests\r\n\r\nthis new one changes the flow to leverage the `unit` image (that already\r\nhas all of the bits we need), and put into the script the manual work\r\nthat we needed to do before.\r\n\r\nafter this changes, the flow looks like:\r\n\r\n1. `run containerd`\r\n2. `run test`\r\n\r\n**ps.: depends on https://github.com/concourse/ci/pull/253** - without it, `concourse/unit` (the image used as the base here) will not have the proper binaries for running `containerd`.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Changes proposed in this pull request\r\n\r\n- have a script that sets up the environment for running the integration tests, leveraging the image that already has all the `containerd` contents\r\n\r\n### Contributor Checklist\r\n\r\n- ~Unit tests~\r\n- ~Integration tests (if applicable)~\r\n- ~Updated documentation (located at https://github.com/concourse/docs)~\r\n- ~Updated release notes (located at

Using relative paths causes a new volume to be created instead of mounting the .\r\n\r\n**Steps to reproduce the issue:**\r\n1. Run: `docker run -v .:/source alpine` OR `docker run --mount source=.,target=/source alpine`\r\n1. Run:\r\n```bash\r\nmkdir source\r\ntouch source/test\r\n\r\ndocker run -it -v ./source:/source alpine\r\n# (in the container's shell)\r\nls /source\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Describe the results you received:**\r\n1. The error message:\r\n```\r\ndocker: Error response from daemon: create .: volume name is too short, names should be at least two alphanumeric characters.\r\nSee 'docker run --help'.\r\n```\r\n1. The `ls` command does not show any files in the `/source` directory. Instead, a new docker volume is created with the name `source`.\r\n\r\n**Describe the results you expected:**\r\n1. The current directory to be mounted to the docker container at the path `/source`.\r\n1. The `source` folder in the current directory to be mounted to the docker container at the path `/source`.\r\n\r\n**Additional information you deem important (e.g. issue happens only occasionally):**\r\nThe `-v` and the `--mount` flags should accept relative paths. Using `$(pwd)` on Linux and `%cd%` on Windows is not a pretty solution, and I have to include separate commands for Windows and Linux in my projects.\r\n\r\n**Output of `docker version`:**\r\n\r\n```\r\nClient: Docker Engine - Community\r\n Version:           19.03.8\r\n API version:       1.40\r\n Go version:        go1.12.17\r\n Git commit:        afacb8b\r\n Built:             Wed Mar 11 01:23:10 2020\r\n OS/Arch:           windows/amd64\r\n Experimental:      false\r\n\r\nServer: Docker Engine - Community\r\n Engine:\r\n  Version:          19.03.8\r\n  API version:      1.40 (minimum version 1.12)\r\n  Go version:       go1.12.17\r\n  Git commit:       afacb8b\r\n  Built:            Wed Mar 11 01:29:16 2020\r\n  OS/Arch:          linux/amd64\r\n  Experimental:     false\r\n containerd:\r\n  Version:          v1.2.13\r\n  GitCommit:        7ad184331fa3e55e52b890ea95e65ba581ae3429\r\n runc:\r\n  Version:          1.0.0-rc10\r\n  GitCommit:        dc9208a3303feef5b3839f4323d9beb36df0a9dd\r\n docker-init:\r\n  Version:          0.18.0\r\n  GitCommit:        fec3683\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Output of `docker info`:**\r\n\r\n```\r\nClient:\r\n Debug Mode: false\r\n\r\nServer:\r\n Containers: 0\r\n  Running: 0\r\n  Paused: 0\r\n  Stopped: 0\r\n Images: 3\r\n Server Version: 19.03.8\r\n Storage Driver: overlay2\r\n  Backing Filesystem: <unknown>\r\n  Supports d_type: true\r\n  Native Overlay Diff: true\r\n Logging Driver: json-file\r\n Cgroup Driver: cgroupfs\r\n Plugins:\r\n  Volume: local\r\n  Network: bridge host ipvlan macvlan null overlay\r\n  Log: awslogs fluentd gcplogs gelf journald json-file local logentries splunk syslog\r\n Swarm: inactive\r\n Runtimes: runc\r\n Default Runtime: runc\r\n Init Binary: docker-init\r\n containerd version: 7ad184331fa3e55e52b890ea95e65ba581ae3429\r\n runc version: dc9208a3303feef5b3839f4323d9beb36df0a9dd\r\n init version: fec3683\r\n Security Options:\r\n  seccomp\r\n   Profile: default\r\n Kernel Version: 4.19.76-linuxkit\r\n Operating System: Docker Desktop\r\n OSType: linux\r\n Architecture: x86_64\r\n CPUs: 2\r\n Total Memory: 983.4MiB\r\n Name: docker-desktop\r\n ID: EGN7:AJIT:6MIR:U54L:PZQX:5JCH:INTW:R3LC:77HP:5IKF:U2YX:Q4WQ\r\n Docker Root Dir: /var/lib/docker\r\n Debug Mode: true\r\n  File Descriptors: 34\r\n  Goroutines: 51\r\n  System Time: 2020-05-13T20:43:58.120001272Z\r\n  EventsListeners: 3\r\n Registry: https://index.docker.io/v1/\r\n Labels:\r\n Experimental: false\r\n Insecure Registries:\r\n  127.0.0.0/8\r\n Live Restore Enabled: false\r\n Product License: Community Engine\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Additional environment details (AWS, VirtualBox, physical, etc.):**\r\nDocker Desktop on Windows 10.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/docker/cli/issues/2524/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/docker/cli/issues/2524/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/docker/cli/issues/comments/981757086","html_url":"https://github.com/docker/cli/issues/1203#issuecomment-981757086","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/docker/cli/issues/1203","id":981757086,"node_id":"IC_kwDOBT74_c46hGye","user":{"login":"thaJeztah","id":1804568,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MDQ1Njg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1804568?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/thaJeztah","html_url":"https://github.com/thaJeztah","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thaJeztah/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thaJeztah/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thaJeztah/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thaJeztah/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thaJeztah/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thaJeztah/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thaJeztah/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thaJeztah/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thaJeztah/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-11-29T15:43:10Z","updated_at":"2021-11-29T15:43:10Z","body":"Thanks for opening this ticket. I know we rejected this / similar proposals in the past, but in light of [\"No is temporary, Yes is forever\"](https://github.com/moby/moby/blob/b7a1776878d4851019c65edee1df10fda530dc9a/project/PRINCIPLES.md), perhaps it's time to have another look at this, to see if we are comfortable changing this.\r\n\r\nLet me try to explain the background behind this (and reasons why it was implemented as it is);\r\n\r\n### Reasons why this (so far) hasn't been supported;\r\n\r\nFirst of all, due to the syntax used on the command-line:\r\n\r\n- complexity with the `--volume [<host-path>|<volume-name>:]<container-path>` short-hand syntax;\r\n    - syntax is used for both bind-mounts, named volumes, and anonymous volumes, which makes it ambiguous.\r\n    - due to the above, relative paths can only be implemented \"partially\"; for example, `./some-dir:/some/container/path` could be supported, but not `some-dir:/some/container/path`, as that could either be a bind-mount (`some-dir`) or a volume named `some-dir`.\r\n- the `--mount type=bind,src=<host-path>` should not have this problem (as it should not have the ambiguity between \"bind-mounts\" and \"volumes\"\r\n\r\nThe second reason is more \"fuzzy\", and harder to describe, but may be good to call out explicitly, as there's parts that may need to be looked into (also _in general_);\r\n\r\nBind-mounts are performed on the daemon-side; when creating a container that uses a bind-mount, the `<host-path>` that is specified will be used on the daemon side, which may be on a different machine as the cli (and could even be a different platform, e.g. a `docker` CLI running on macOS or Windows, and the `dockerd` daemon running on Linux (or Windows). This has been a source of confusion for many (especially when using `-v` / `--volume`, which auto-creates missing host-paths); \"mentally\", users expect `<host-path>` to be a path on the machine where they're running the `docker` command. Docker Desktop (and boot2docker before that) added to this mental concept, by trying to make the host-VM boundary as transparent as possible when using bind-mounts.\r\n\r\nSo how does that relate to this proposal? Well, it's somewhat _orthogonal_ (bear with me); as mentioned, bind-mounts happen on the daemon side. For example, if I specify `-v /home/MY_USERNAME/my-project:/app`, I (implicitly) make the assumption that there's a `MY_USERNAME` user-account on the daemon side. This _MAY_ be true (a local setup), but often is not the case (e.g. in situations where the daemon runs somewhere in the cloud). The `docker` CLI cannot make any assumptions whatsoever about paths on the daemon side, as it doesn't have that information.\r\n\r\nFor this, reason, we (so far) did not implement logic in the CLI that would suggest otherwise; the CLI parses the argument, and delegates any other validation to the daemon (which can check if the path is valid, and if it exists). The path sent to the daemon must be an absolute path (otherwise it would be \"relative to `dockerd`\"), and it's left as the user's responsibility to provide that path (which could involve shell mechanisms, such as `$(pwd)`, `~`, or `$HOME`).\r\n\r\n### So, is it worth continue to enforce absolute paths, or should we be fine with accepting relative paths?\r\n\r\nAs outlined above, there were good reasons to require absolute paths. Question is now; should we continue to do this? Yes; we still cannot make any assumption about paths on the daemon side. And, yes, this situation still holds for any \"remote daemon\" where no special handling (as provided by, e.g., Docker Desktop) is in place. However, for \"inner loop\" / \"local\" development, the current situation may be causing more confusion than it helps preventing. I expect the \"this path must be absolute, because it's a remote path\" message to be lost on most users.\r\n\r\nLooking at some other commands / options that _do_ accept relative paths;\r\n\r\n- `docker build <path to context>`, `docker build -f <path to Dockerfile>`, `docker build --output...`, `docker build --iidfile ...`\r\n- `docker run` / `docker create` `--cidfile`, `--env-file`, `--label-file`, `--security-opt seccomp-profile=...`\r\n- `docker cp <container-path> <host-path>`\r\n- `docker export --output` and `docker import`\r\n- `docker-compose` (compose-file) works with paths relative to the location of the compose file\r\n\r\nI should note that most of these, with the exception of the Docker Compose case, act on local file-paths, not remote/daemon side, but this distinction is hard to explain to users. Docker Compose originated from being a \"developer tool\", and always had a stronger preference for \"local development\" (against a local daemon, not a \"remote\" deployment).\r\n\r\n### What to do with other \"special\" paths?\r\n\r\nSomewhat related to this discussion; handling of `~`. Docker itself does not expand `~` to \"home-dir\"; expansion of this is handled by the shell. I've seen confusion around this, especially in situations where someone writes an example using `~`, which works on macOS and Linux, but may fail on Windows (resulting in it being used as a _literal_ `~`). I don't think we should try to expand these, but perhaps we should consider printing warnings if there's a (likely) mistake. For example, if the shell didn't expand `~`, and the `docker` CLI receives this character, we could print a warning. Perhaps even do the same for other cases, such as when we find a literal `$HOME`, `%HOMEPATH%`, or `$(pwd)`.\r\n\r\n### How to handle conversion for non-matching platforms?\r\n\r\nThis is even more orthogonal, so just a brief mention; perhaps we need to look if we can make the path-conversion for non-matching platforms \"pluggable\". Currently, Docker Desktop contains logic to convert (e.g.) a Windows `C:\\some\\directory` path to corresponding paths inside the Docker Desktop VM (e.g. `/mounts/host/some/directory`). Would be good to have this logic handled in a more \"standardised\" way; but let's keep that for a separate discussion.\r\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/docker/cli/issues/comments/981757086/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"thaJeztah","id":1804568,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MDQ1Njg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1804568?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/thaJeztah","html_url":"https://github.com/thaJeztah","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thaJeztah/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thaJeztah/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thaJeztah/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thaJeztah/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thaJeztah/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thaJeztah/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thaJeztah/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thaJeztah/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thaJeztah/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}}]
