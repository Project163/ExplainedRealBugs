should be a way to allow insecure https requests, using `window.fetch()` for example.\r\nIt should disable certificate validation for all requests made from the program.\r\n\r\nAs of implementation, there are two optoins that come to my mind: environment variable and flag. Below are some examples of how it's done in other web-related software, so we can come up with intuitive name and approach.\r\n\r\nExamples:\r\n- In NodeJS, [there is](https://github.com/nodejs/node/blob/2cb8f247512d611d3dfe81c2441e8028bfb0e8f0/doc/api/cli.md#node_tls_reject_unauthorizedvalue) a `NODE_TLS_REJECT_UNAUTHORIZED` environment variable that can be set to `0` to disable TLS certificate validation. It takes name from [tls.connect options.rejectUnauthorized](https://nodejs.org/docs/latest/api/tls.html#tls_tls_connect_options_callback)\r\n- In curl, there's a `-k` or `--insecure` flag, which allows insecure server connections when using SSL\r\n- In Chrome, there's a `--unsafely-treat-insecure-origin-as-secure=\"https://example.com\"` for the same purposes\r\n- For WebDrivers, there's [acceptInsecureCerts](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/WebDriver/Capabilities/acceptInsecureCerts) capability. It can allow self-signed or otherwise invalid certificates to be implicitly trusted by the browser.\r\n\r\nThat said, I'd like to see `--accept-insecure-certs` flag option, because deno already uses flags for a lot of things, including permissions.\r\n\r\n---\r\nMy use-case: I'm using a corporate Windows laptop with network monitoring. AFAIK, all https requests are also monitored, so there's a custom SSL-certificate installed system-wide. So, most of the software, that uses system CA storage, works just fine. But some uses custom or bundled CA, and it seems like it's a case with deno. Anyway, it downloads deps just fine, but fails to perfprm any https request.\r\n\r\nIssue created as a follow up to gitter conversation: [December 18, 2018 1:24

Describe the problem\n\nMy app lets users connect to self-hosted services that often use self-signed or otherwise untrusted ssl certificates. I cannot access these services with tauri because of certificate errors.\n\n### Describe the solution you'd like\n\nIdeal solution would be a prompt that lets users chose to trust the certificate. Another way would be how electron handles it, you can hook to a `certificate-error` event and ignore the errors, something like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\n// SSL/TSL: this is the self signed certificate support\r\napp.on('certificate-error', (event, webContents, url, error, certificate, callback) => {\r\n    // On certificate error we disable default behaviour (stop loading the page)\r\n    // and we then say \"it is all fine - true\" to the callback\r\n    event.preventDefault();\r\n    callback(true);\r\n});\r\n```\r\n[source](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/38986692/how-do-i-trust-a-self-signed-certificate-from-an-electron-app)\n\n### Alternatives considered\n\nEven a command line flag like chromiums `--ignore-certificate-errors` would be helpful.\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No

certificate/hostname validation. Whatever I do I end up with a `CertificateRequired` error.\n\n**To Reproduce**\nSteps to reproduce the behavior:\n1. Create a `ServerCertVerifier` as found at https://github.com/seanmonstar/reqwest/issues/1210\n```rust\n// rustls = { version = \"0.23.25\", default-features=false, features=[\"log\",\"logging\",\"ring\",\"std\",\"tls12\"]}\n// rustls-pki-types = {version=\"1.11.0\", default-features=false, features=[\"alloc\",\"default\",\"std\"]}\n\nuse rustls::{\n    client::danger::{HandshakeSignatureValid, ServerCertVerified, ServerCertVerifier},\n    ClientConfig, DigitallySignedStruct, Error as TLSError, SignatureScheme,\n};\nuse rustls_pki_types::{ServerName, UnixTime};\n\n#[derive(Debug)]\npub(crate) struct NoVerifier;\nimpl ServerCertVerifier for NoVerifier {\n    fn verify_server_cert(\n        &self,\n        _end_entity: &rustls_pki_types::CertificateDer,\n        _intermediates: &[rustls_pki_types::CertificateDer],\n        _server_name: &ServerName,\n        _ocsp_response: &[u8],\n        _now: UnixTime,\n    ) -> Result<ServerCertVerified, TLSError> {\n        Ok(ServerCertVerified::assertion())\n    }\n\n    fn verify_tls12_signature(\n        &self,\n        _message: &[u8],\n        _cert: &rustls_pki_types::CertificateDer,\n        _dss: &DigitallySignedStruct,\n    ) -> Result<HandshakeSignatureValid, TLSError> {\n        Ok(HandshakeSignatureValid::assertion())\n    }\n\n    fn verify_tls13_signature(\n        &self,\n        _message: &[u8],\n        _cert: &rustls_pki_types::CertificateDer,\n        _dss: &DigitallySignedStruct,\n    ) -> Result<HandshakeSignatureValid, TLSError> {\n        Ok(HandshakeSignatureValid::assertion())\n    }\n\n    fn supported_verify_schemes(&self) -> Vec<SignatureScheme> {\n        // 14: that's all of them\n        vec![\n            SignatureScheme::RSA_PKCS1_SHA1,\n            SignatureScheme::ECDSA_SHA1_Legacy,\n            SignatureScheme::RSA_PKCS1_SHA256,\n            SignatureScheme::ECDSA_NISTP256_SHA256,\n            SignatureScheme::RSA_PKCS1_SHA384,\n            SignatureScheme::ECDSA_NISTP384_SHA384,\n            SignatureScheme::RSA_PKCS1_SHA512,\n            SignatureScheme::ECDSA_NISTP521_SHA512,\n            SignatureScheme::RSA_PSS_SHA256,\n            SignatureScheme::RSA_PSS_SHA384,\n            SignatureScheme::RSA_PSS_SHA512,\n            SignatureScheme::ED25519,\n            SignatureScheme::ED448,\n        ]\n    }\n}\n```\n2.
