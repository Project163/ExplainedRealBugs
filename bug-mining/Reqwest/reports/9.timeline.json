I'd like to take this opportunity to get the design right. Some things I'd like to consider for this feature:\r\n\r\n- Common case is an HTTP proxy, make that easy\r\n- Probably support common environment variables\r\n- The design must make it easy to add in other protocols later, like SOCKS\r\n- Some proxies require authorization, would be nice if a proxy in reqwest could be configured to pass the `Proxy-Authorization` header\r\n- Some may want a list of proxies, such as 1 for HTTP and 1 for HTTPS\r\n- curl offers the ability to make an exclude list for proxies, where any URL in the list skips using a proxy. Is this very useful, or sufficiently niche enough that people can just use 2 `Client`s?\r\n\r\n------\r\n\r\nI've spent most of my time getting https-over-https working, so the code I have so far doesn't handle most of the above considerations. At the moment, it only supports a single proxy, but making them is quite easy.\r\n\r\n```rust\r\nlet http = Proxy::http(\"example.proxy.domain\", 4321);\r\nlet https = Proxy::https(\"secure.proxy.example\", 5432);\r\n\r\nlet proxy = Proxy::env(); // constructor name? allow passing a list of env vars to check?\r\n\r\n// how to use them is not determined yet\r\n\r\n// either\r\nlet client = reqwest::Client::proxied(http);\r\n// or\r\nclient.proxy(https);\r\n```\r\n\r\nMaybe building a list is simply adding or anding proxies together? `let list = http + https` or `http & https`.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure how you would clearly add an authorization to a proxy. Perhaps a mutator method, `proxy.authorization(auth_string)`. Though it seems that this method and combining proxies such as above could lead to confusion...","author_association":"OWNER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/seanmonstar/reqwest/issues/comments/267125469/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"seanmonstar","id":51479,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxNDc5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/51479?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar","html_url":"https://github.com/seanmonstar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/seanmonstar/reqwest/issues/comments/267229454","html_url":"https://github.com/seanmonstar/reqwest/issues/30#issuecomment-267229454","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/seanmonstar/reqwest/issues/30","id":267229454,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI2NzIyOTQ1NA==","user":{"login":"ajdlinux","id":2901442,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5MDE0NDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2901442?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajdlinux","html_url":"https://github.com/ajdlinux","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajdlinux/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajdlinux/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajdlinux/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajdlinux/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajdlinux/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajdlinux/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajdlinux/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajdlinux/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajdlinux/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-12-15T03:30:39Z","updated_at":"2016-12-15T03:30:39Z","body":"> curl offers the ability to make an exclude list for proxies, where any URL in the list skips using a proxy.
