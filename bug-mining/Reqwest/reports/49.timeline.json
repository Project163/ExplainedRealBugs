I thought some browsers had loop detection, but it looks like Chrome hits `ERR_TOO_MANY_REDIRECTS` before any loop detection comes into play (at least for me). Firefox says \"The page isn't redirecting properly\", and looking through the source it looks like that comes from an error constant called `NS_ERROR_REDIRECT_LOOP` -- the source of those errors in the C++ code appear to also be based on counting and exceeding a maximum rather than actually tracking a loop. \r\n\r\nThe current relevant RFC (https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231#section-6.4) does say a \"client SHOULD detect and intervene in cyclical redirections (i.e.,\r\n   \"infinite\" redirection loops)\" but goes on to note than the earlier RFC 2068 had simply suggested that clients not automatically redirect a request more than 5 times (https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2068#section-10.3). \r\n\r\nI do think reqwest having the ability to implement a custom RedirectPolicy is really great, and ideally I'd be able to implement custom loop detection myself using that facility. However, if I'm understanding the documentation correctly for `RedirectAttempts`, the only relevant data available is the `&[Url]` slice in `previous` - so we only have the list of urls and not the rest of the requests (such as the cookies or other headers). Am I missing some way to store custom context from the previous requests to use in a custom redirect policy implementation? I guess I could store my own record (of request hashes or something) in an external data structure, but I think that would probably have to live in a lazy_static or something and would probably come with undesirable concurrency management issues.\r\n\r\nActually, it probably would not be hard to just make the whole `Request` history available custom redirect policies so that any arbitrary logic can be added to inspect that. Perhaps `RedirectAttempt` could have something like this added:\r\n```\r\npub fn request(&self) -> &Request\r\npub fn previous_requests(&self) -> &[Request]\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn addition to the existing:\r\n```\r\npub fn url(&self) -> &Url\r\npub fn previous(&self) -> &[Url]\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis would probably work, although if I were implementing this without having to conform to this interface, I'd probably want to just hash the request as each one is processed and store the hash in the `previous` slice (or perhaps a Set would be more efficient). On the other hand, with the addition of `previous_requests` a custom policy could be implemented that would work just like the existing one and be primarily based on detecting potential loops using the Url, but then have additional code added to check the relevant entry in `previous_requests` to see if they actually are identical to the current one.
