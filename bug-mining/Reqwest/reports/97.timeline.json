`ClientBuilder` type has an `interface` method that sets the name of a specific network interface to bind TCP connections on. This method is currently only enabled on Linux, Android, and Fuchsia, as it uses the `SO_BINDTODEVICE` socket option, which only exists on those systems. Upstream changes to `socket2` (rust-lang/socket2#561) and `hyper-util` (hyperium/hyper-util#176) have added support for similar functionality on macOS (and other Apple operating systems, such as iOS, watchOS, tvOS, and visionOS), and Solaris and Solaris-like systems like illumos, using the `IP_BOUND_IF`/`IPV6_BOUND_IF` socket options on those systems.\r\n\r\nThis branch enables the `ClientBuilder::interface` API on these additional target OSes.\r\n\r\nNote that this presently requires a Cargo patch to take a Git dependency on hyperium/hyper-util@5831ace168fc243ce03b97b6f6f8a0de3aa68d17. Once that commit is published, the patch can be removed. This PR should not be merged until then.\r\n\r\nFixes #2571","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/seanmonstar/reqwest/issues/2623/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/seanmonstar/reqwest/issues/2623/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":17189221373,"node_id":"CE_lADOA7dkLM6rzwjazwAAAAQAjrP9","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/seanmonstar/reqwest/issues/events/17189221373","actor":{"login":"seanmonstar","id":51479,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxNDc5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/51479?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar","html_url":"https://github.com/seanmonstar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2025-04-09T13:01:14Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":17189221443,"node_id":"CE_lADOA7dkLM6rzwjazwAAAAQAjrRD","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/seanmonstar/reqwest/issues/events/17189221443","actor":{"login":"seanmonstar","id":51479,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxNDc5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/51479?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar","html_url":"https://github.com/seanmonstar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":"114d97c1a862567b465cb57f14d584626e1cf30c","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/seanmonstar/reqwest/commits/114d97c1a862567b465cb57f14d584626e1cf30c","created_at":"2025-04-09T13:01:14Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":17190569942,"node_id":"REFE_lADOA7dkLM6rzwjazwAAAAQAo0fW","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/seanmonstar/reqwest/issues/events/17190569942","actor":{"login":"pull[bot]","id":39814207,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90Mzk4MTQyMDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/12910?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pull%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/pull","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pull%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pull%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pull%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pull%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pull%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pull%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pull%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pull%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pull%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"114d97c1a862567b465cb57f14d584626e1cf30c","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Superoldman96/reqwest/commits/114d97c1a862567b465cb57f14d584626e1cf30c","created_at":"2025-04-09T14:17:32Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
