using reqwest 'automatic' decompression\r\n```\r\nlet client = reqwest::blocking::Client::builder()\r\n// some other headers and features: user agent, timeout,...\r\n.deflate( true )\r\n

\r\n```\r\nError: error decoding response body: deflate decompression error\r\n\r\nCaused by:\r\n    deflate decompression error\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nIf I don't change the server, but:\r\n- use 'builder.deflate(false) on the reqwest client (to suppress automatic decompression of the response)\r\n- manually add a header on the request builder\r\n```builder = builder.header(\"Accept-Encoding\", \"deflate\");```\r\n- and decompress \"manually\" the response:\r\n```\r\n            let body = response.bytes()?;\r\n            log::debug!(\"Compressed size:
