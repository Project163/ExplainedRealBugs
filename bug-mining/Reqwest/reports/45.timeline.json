don't whink we need to use something like [env_proxy] crate, because it doesn't support `windows system`.  So I implement it once again..  And this version of `getproxies` should work on `windows` and `linux`.\r\n\r\n### Something about testing\r\nIn `windows` system, because the proxy setting is configured from `registry`.  I just do manually testing for this scenario.  (I have implemented it [in another place first](https://github.com/WindSoilder/hors/blob/master/src/proxies.rs))\r\nI'm afraid the testing code may break `windows registry setting`.
