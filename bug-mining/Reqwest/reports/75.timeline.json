am building a service that needs to fetch user-provided URLs. I have added some protection such that the user can't request `localhost`, `whatever.internal` or `10.0.0.1`. However I have not found a way to block a request such as `internal.some-real-domain.example` which resolves to an internal IP address. I think it would be valuable if reqwest could provide an internal hook, much like the redirect hook that could validate (and maybe rewrite) IP addresses before connections are made.\r\n\r\nThe following cases should be handled:\r\n\r\n1. Top level requests to IP addresses.\r\n2. Top level requests to domains.\r\n3. Redirects to either of the above.\r\n\r\nA possible API would be something like this:\r\n\r\n```rust\r\nimpl ClientBuilder {\r\n  pub fn ip(self, policy: reqwest::ip::Policy) -> Self;\r\n}\r\n\r\nmod ip {\r\n  struct Policy;\r\n\r\n  impl Policy {\r\n    pub fn custom(fn: impl Fn(Attempt<'_>) -> Action + Send + Sync + 'static) -> Self;\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  struct Attempt;\r\n\r\n  impl Attempt {\r\n    pub fn url(&self) -> &Url;\r\n    pub fn ip(&self) -> std::net::SocketAddr;\r\n\r\n    pub fn allow(self) -> Action;\r\n    pub fn connect_to(self, std::net::SocketAddr) -> Action;\r\n    pub fn error(self, error: impl Into<Box<dyn StdError + Send + Sync>>) -> Action;\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  struct Action;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n(This is modeled after the redirect module but maybe the naming could be tweaked to be more clear in this case.)\r\n\r\nFor my use I would do something like this:\r\n\r\n```rust\r\nreqwest::Client::build()\r\n  .ip(request::ip::Policy::custom(|attempt| {\r\n    if attempt.ip().is_global() {\r\n      attempt.allow()\r\n    } else {\r\n      attempt.error(FeedError::Host(attempt.ip().to_string())\r\n    }\r\n  })\r\n```\r\n\r\nUnanswered questions:\r\n- Async?\r\n- How to handle non-IP connections. For example UNIX sockets or Tor addresses. I think maybe the IP policy can be skipped for these as they are both knowable based on the URL (a hostname can't resolve to either of these AFAIK).\r\n- This always resolves the IP. Maybe it could be made lazy to make this essentially a full DNS resolution hook, but then we are back to \"async?\"\r\n\r\nAlternatives:\r\n- The user can manually resolve the hostname then pass the IP to reqwest along with `Host:` header and SSL verification configuration. This is difficult and error prone.\r\n- A general DNS resolution hook can be added. This may be a bit more flexible but would make it harder to support things like `SRV` records (or whatever alternative is currently being proposed).\r\n- Do nothing. Then users of reqwest are at risk of information leaks if they connect to user-provided URLs.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/seanmonstar/reqwest/issues/1515/reactions","total_count":6,"+1":6,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/seanmonstar/reqwest/issues/1515/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"actor":{"login":"irrelevelephant","id":2774530,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3NzQ1MzA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2774530?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/irrelevelephant","html_url":"https://github.com/irrelevelephant","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/irrelevelephant/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/irrelevelephant/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/irrelevelephant/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/irrelevelephant/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/irrelevelephant/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/irrelevelephant/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/irrelevelephant/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/irrelevelephant/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/irrelevelephant/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-10-14T08:41:49Z","updated_at":"2022-10-14T08:41:49Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/seanmonstar/reqwest/issues/1653","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/seanmonstar/reqwest","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/seanmonstar/reqwest/issues/1653/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/seanmonstar/reqwest/issues/1653/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/seanmonstar/reqwest/issues/1653/events","html_url":"https://github.com/seanmonstar/reqwest/pull/1653","id":1408992413,"node_id":"PR_kwDOA7dkLM5AzFxX","number":1653,"title":"support

change refactors DNS resolution, with the goal of supporting custom DNS resolvers. It addresses [#1125](https://github.com/seanmonstar/reqwest/issues/1125).\r\n\r\nPreviously, reqwest defined its own `HttpConnector`, which dispatched to a different `hyper::client::HttpConnector<R>` instance depending on an enum state. This led to excess complexity in the `Future` type associated with the `Service<Uri>` implementation for the connector, which can be circumvented with a trait object.\r\n\r\nThis approach exchanges the enum for a trait object, which introduces a dynamic dispatch, but eliminates the enum match inside `HttpConnector`.\r\n\r\nOne annoyance is that trait objects can't make use of associated types, so the return type of the `resolve` function on the trait needs to be explicitly defined. Let me know what you think - happy to make changes.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/seanmonstar/reqwest/issues/1653/reactions","total_count":4,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":4,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/seanmonstar/reqwest/issues/1653/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":7723378443,"node_id":"CE_lADOA7dkLM4uL7e8zwAAAAHMWWcL","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/seanmonstar/reqwest/issues/events/7723378443","actor":{"login":"seanmonstar","id":51479,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxNDc5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/51479?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar","html_url":"https://github.com/seanmonstar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":"f11e9584339e3bc298949a3eb4f142c5d4949312","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/seanmonstar/reqwest/commits/f11e9584339e3bc298949a3eb4f142c5d4949312","created_at":"2022-11-02T13:27:11Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/seanmonstar/reqwest/issues/comments/1314829361","html_url":"https://github.com/seanmonstar/reqwest/issues/1125#issuecomment-1314829361","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/seanmonstar/reqwest/issues/1125","id":1314829361,"node_id":"IC_kwDOA7dkLM5OXrQx","user":{"login":"niuhuan","id":20847533,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwODQ3NTMz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20847533?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/niuhuan","html_url":"https://github.com/niuhuan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/niuhuan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/niuhuan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/niuhuan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/niuhuan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/niuhuan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/niuhuan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/niuhuan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/niuhuan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/niuhuan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-11-15T06:20:08Z","updated_at":"2022-11-15T06:20:25Z","body":"When time publish this feature?
