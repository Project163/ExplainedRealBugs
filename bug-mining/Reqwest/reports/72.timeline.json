all!\r\n\r\nI'm coming up against this same issue (with an API key in the query). @seanmonstar /@kangalioo, is there any plan to merge #1299? Otherwise, I'd propose a PR with the following API which probably covers the gamut of the above:\r\n```rust\r\n\r\n/// Mutative methods\r\n\r\n/// Get a mutable reference to the url, if present (for example, if you wanted to modify the url to remove the sensitive information\r\npub fn url_mut(&mut self) -> Option<&mut Url>;\r\n/// Remove the url entirely\r\npub fn clear_url(&mut self) -> &mut Self;\r\n/// Strip the url and return self (similar to `clear_url`, but possibly more ergonomic in some cases)\r\npub fn without_url(mut self) -> Self;\r\n\r\n/// Format Structs (where each return wrapper implements Display)\r\n\r\n/// Return a wrapper struct (borrowing self) that masks the url in the display impl (but still shows that it exists\r\npub fn as_url_masked(&self) -> UrlMaskedError<'_>;\r\n/// Return a wrapper struct (borrowing self) that ignores the url field\r\npub fn as_url_hidden(&self) -> UrlHiddenError<'_>;\r\n/// Return a wrapper struct (borrowing self) that applies a custom formatting function to the url on display.\r\npub fn with_url_formatter<F: Fn(&Url, f: &mut std::fmt::Formatter) -> std::fmt::Result>(&self, f: F) -> UrlFormattedError<'_, F>;\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd, since we're allowing mutation of the `url` field, it may make sense to make `Error::with_url`, which already exists, public.","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/seanmonstar/reqwest/issues/comments/1015020058/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"ecclarke42","id":30056115,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwMDU2MTE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/30056115?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ecclarke42","html_url":"https://github.com/ecclarke42","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ecclarke42/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ecclarke42/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ecclarke42/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ecclarke42/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ecclarke42/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ecclarke42/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ecclarke42/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ecclarke42/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ecclarke42/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":5907618845,"node_id":"MEE_lADOA7dkLM4TWSeRzwAAAAFgHxwd","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/seanmonstar/reqwest/issues/events/5907618845","actor":{"login":"seanmonstar","id":51479,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxNDc5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/51479?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar","html_url":"https://github.com/seanmonstar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-01-18T02:37:54Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":5907618848,"node_id":"SE_lADOA7dkLM4TWSeRzwAAAAFgHxwg","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/seanmonstar/reqwest/issues/events/5907618848","actor":{"login":"seanmonstar","id":51479,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxNDc5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/51479?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar","html_url":"https://github.com/seanmonstar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-01-18T02:37:54Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":5907618853,"node_id":"MEE_lADOA7dkLM4TWSeRzwAAAAFgHxwl","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/seanmonstar/reqwest/issues/events/5907618853","actor":{"login":"kangalio","id":21220820,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMjIwODIw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21220820?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kangalio","html_url":"https://github.com/kangalio","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kangalio/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kangalio/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kangalio/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kangalio/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kangalio/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kangalio/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kangalio/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kangalio/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kangalio/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-01-18T02:37:54Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":5907618857,"node_id":"SE_lADOA7dkLM4TWSeRzwAAAA

(`write_kind`) and source (`write_source`) are added for consistency across formats, as well as `write_url_plain` and `write_url_masked` for different URL displays.\r\n\r\nFinally, a test was added to

issue #297 and PR #1442.\r\n\r\nA method `without_url` was added earlier, which is useful for removing URL from a single Error to prevent leaking secrets. But in a Rust binary, most functions probably return `anyhow::Result<_>` instead of `Result<_, ConcreteError>` - the concrete error type is converted to a display type. To ensure that secrets are not leaked, users need to call `.map_err(|err| err.without_url())` for each `Result<_, reqwest::Error>`, which is inconvenient and easy to forget.\r\n\r\nI propose to add a crate feature `strip-url-in-error`. when it is enabled, radically remove the `url` field from `reqwest::Error`, and remove the relevant methods (`url_mut`, `with_url` and `without_url`).","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/seanmonstar/reqwest/issues/2365/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/seanmonstar/reqwest/issues/2365/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"not_planned"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":15178771295,"node_id":"REFE_lADOA7dkLM4TWSeRzwAAAAOIuatf","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/seanmonstar/reqwest/issues/events/15178771295","actor":{"login":"Nutomic","id":1044450,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNDQ0NTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1044450?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nutomic","html_url":"https://github.com/Nutomic","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nutomic/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nutomic/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nutomic/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nutomic/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nutomic/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nutomic/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nutomic/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nutomic/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Nutomic/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"e34033818bd8f2899eeaf9ff556f54aa5d5011c7","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Nutomic/reqwest/commits/e34033818bd8f2899eeaf9ff556f54aa5d5011c7","created_at":"2024-11-07T11:18:37Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
