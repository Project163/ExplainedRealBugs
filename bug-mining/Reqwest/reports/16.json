It is badly needed, and I appreciate that you shared it.\r\n\r\nRun the following simple test:\r\n```rust\r\nextern crate reqwest;\r\nuse reqwest::Error;\r\n\r\nfn main() {\r\n    match run() {\r\n        Ok(_) => println!(\"success!\"),\r\n        Err(e) => eprintln!(\"Error: {}\",e),\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\nfn run() -> Result<(), Error> {\r\n    let client = reqwest::Client::new();\r\n    let mut res = reqwest::get(\"http://google.com\")?;\r\n    let text = res.text()?;\r\n    Ok(())\r\n}\r\n```\r\nThis is the output:\r\n```\r\nsh-4.4$ ./target/debug/rtest\r\nError: stream did not contain valid UTF-8\r\n```\r\nThe error happens because ```Response::text()``` ignores the ```Content-Type: text/html; charset=ISO-8859-1``` header from google. ```Response::text()``` is using ```read_to_string()``` from the std library which explicitly requires utf-8 encoding. \r\n\r\nI think it is a rather big problem if reqwest can't handle google.com. You could  use the ecoding crate and honor the encoding header. As a short term workaround you could provide a method to return a ```&[u8]``` rather than a ```String```, and the user can work around the bug.\r\n\r\n**NOTE**: Google may change their page tomorrow and everything will work fine. Nonetheless I am glad it broke becuse otherwise this would have been hard to discover!\r\n\r\nHere is the data in case google changes their pages:\r\n[2018_01_16_www.google.com.data_non_utf8.txt.gz](https://github.com/seanmonstar/reqwest/files/1635825/2018_01_16_www.google.com.data_non_utf8.txt.gz)\r\n[2018_01_16_www.google.com.header.txt.gz](https://github.com/seanmonstar/reqwest/files/1635826/2018_01_16_www.google.com.header.txt.gz)\r\n\r\nBTW, it is rather funny that the offending bytes are around the \"Advertising Program\" string :)\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"seanmonstar","id":51479,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxNDc5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/51479?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar","html_url":"https://github.com/seanmonstar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/seanmonstar/reqwest/issues/246/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/seanmonstar/reqwest/issues/246/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
