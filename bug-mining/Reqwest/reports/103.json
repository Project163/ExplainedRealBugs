Using a local proxy confirms this: `HTTP/1 protocol error: peer closed connection without sending complete message body (received 0 bytes, expected 360)`\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/254fc282-a084-4796-bba3-078976ca8331)\n\n## Environment\n* OS: Windows 10\n* reqwest v0.12.16 with features: `blocking`, `cookies`, `gzip`, `rustls-tls` (Tested: The issue still occurs in 0.12.18)\n* Rust 1.87.0 \n\n## Protocol Violation\nI think this is essentially a violation of the [HTTP/1.1 spec](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7230#section-3.3.2):\n> A user agent SHOULD NOT send a Content-Length header field when the request message does not contain a payload body and the method semantics do not anticipate such a body.\n\nIn this case the GET is such a method, where no body is anticipated.","closed_by":{"login":"seanmonstar","id":51479,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxNDc5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/51479?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar","html_url":"https://github.com/seanmonstar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/seanmonstar/reqwest/issues/2705/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/seanmonstar/reqwest/issues/2705/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
