has `--resolve <host:port:address> Resolve the host+port to this address`\r\nwget does similar by over-riding the host header, but I imagine that isn't going to be compatible with SNI?\r\n\r\nNow that I'm looking at it, I can see why curl would have a --resolve as opposed to a skip_resolution, as it would matter with redirects.  If you skip resolution on the first host, but then get redirected, do you then use DNS for the redirect if it goes to a new host?\r\n\r\nIn this case, you'd want to simply set up a resolution mask where host A maps to IP A, and let all other names resolve normally.  In curls example, they are allowing host A to map to IP A, only on a specific port, otherwise use DNS as normal (I think even for host A on a different port).\r\n\r\nThat seems a bit more complex than what I was envisioning, where I would simply want to establish a static Host->IP resolution, ignoring the port.\r\n\r\nNow that I've seen how curl does it, I think I'd want to leave DNS resolution \"on\" for any names that weren't already defined, and have a `.resolve(&str, std::net::IpAddr)` to define name->ip's that would be usable prior to issuing each request.  Each .resolve() would append to an internal dns cache that would then be checked prior to doing DNS resolution.  I anticipate that there wouldn't be so many DNS over-rides that one would want .resolve() to accept an array of names->IP's.  \r\n\r\nSince the default resolver is already replaceable with a custom one, maybe all this is really a bogus feature request?

services ([RFC 7838](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7838)) are a way of separating the a request's logical origin from its network location.\r\n\r\nThat is, if you know that the origin `foo.example` has an alternative HTTP/2 service running on `bar.example`, in order to fetch the URL `https://foo.example/`, you could connect to `bar.example` on TCP port 443, validate that the server's certificate is valid for `foo.example`, and then issue the request.\r\n\r\nAlternative services can be discovered (today via the `Alt-Svc` header or the `ALTSVC` frame, and eventually [over DNS](https://github.com/MikeBishop/dns-alt-svc)), or they can be known prior to making any requests (e.g., hardcoding that `quic.example` supports HTTP/3 on UDP port 443 to save round-trips and actually benefit from 0 RTT connection establishment).\r\n\r\nreqwest's API is compatible with discovered alternative services - presumably they'd be handled internally and transparently, and the consuming code doesn't even have to notice. That's not implemented by reqwest yet - but, if there was a prior-knowledge API, consuming code that cares could perform discovery itself.\r\n\r\nHowever, reqwest does not allow for prior-knowledge alternative services: the API takes the request's URL and then looks up the hostname from there.\r\n\r\nThis problem - separating the request URL and the location to connect and sent the request to - very much resembles #39 (connecting to Unix sockets) and #561 (bypassing DNS altogether). I think the API for prior-knowledge alternative services should be able to cover both. That means that it should be possible to mark a prior-knowledge alternative service as the *only* way to connect, rather than merely being an option. (There's also some fiddliness with Unix sockets, HTTP/1.1 vs HTTP/2, and TLS - for a `https` URL, it should be possible to have the Unix socket speak TLS, direct HTTP/1.1, or direct HTTP/1.1, but that information can be provided as part of the prior

we have a test that loads 'https://example.com' in chrome, firefox and curl and verifies that the content of the page is as expected.

Here's my attempt to make a generic wrapper resolver that would allow a user to add specific overrides:\r\n\r\n```\r\n    async fn new_wrapping_resolver<R, U>(\r\n        mut wrapped_resolver: R,\r\n        overrides: std::sync::Arc<HashMap<String, SocketAddr>>,\r\n    ) -> impl Service<Name, Response = impl Iterator<Item = SocketAddr>>\r\n    where\r\n        R: Service<Name, Response = U> + 'static,\r\n        U: Iterator<Item = SocketAddr>,\r\n    {\r\n        type EitherOverrideOrWrapped<U> = itertools::Either<std::iter::Once<SocketAddr>, U>;\r\n        tower::service_fn(move |name: Name| {\r\n            if let Some(overridden) = overrides.get(name.as_str()) {\r\n                return futures_util::future::ok::<EitherOverrideOrWrapped<U>, R::Error>(\r\n                    EitherOverrideOrWrapped::Left(std::iter::once(*overridden)),\r\n                )\r\n                .left_future();\r\n            } else {\r\n                return wrapped_resolver\r\n                    .call(name)\r\n                    .map(|result| result.map(|iter| EitherOverrideOrWrapped::Right(iter)))\r\n                    .right_future();\r\n            }\r\n        })\r\n    }\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is the first time I've written this kind of futures + iterators code so this may be unidiomatic (happy to rework if there are better options). NB: this adds tower and itertools as new dependencies of reqwest.\r\n\r\nThe implication of this though is that the resolver becomes a new unnamed type, and there is an overhead for clients that are not using overrides at all. \r\n\r\nOther options for a design here that I can see:\r\n* A new WrappedResolver Struct generic over the resolver. Then two new constructors for HttpConnector with names `new_gai_with_overrides()` and `new_trust_dns_with_overrides()`. Then a third variant of HttpConnector with a generic inner type. I don't know enough about how the different resolvers are used to know whether this has more implications and this means two new functions per resolver being added.\r\n* Make HttpConnector a generic new_type over hyper::client::HttpConnector rather than an enum. This would simplify connect.rs (I think) but would presumably impact the rest of the crate.\r\n\r\nIf anyone has any input on how this could be cleanly implemented I'm happy to take a swing and get a PR up.

change allows users to bypass the selected DNS resolver for\r\nspecific domains. The allows, for example, to make calls to a local TLS\r\nserver by rerouting a given domain to 127.0.0.1.\r\n\r\nThe approach I've taken for the design is to wrap the resolver in an\r\nouter service. This leads to a fair amount of boilerplate code mainly to\r\nbe able to explain the typing to the compiler. The actual business logic\r\nis very simple for the number of lines involved.\r\n\r\nOne alternative option I considered was using an inline `tower_service` instead of a struct. This is possible at the cost of making reqwest's HttpConnector generic, because I could not find a way to state the type of this inlined struct. This was a bigger change than I wanted to make but happy to reconsider, it would reduce the boilerplate for sure.\r\n\r\nNB: this change adds a new dependency (itertools). This is simply to use one struct (itertools::Either) which would be simple to implement directly. If keeping the dependency tree short is needed this is a small change I believe.\r\n\r\nCloses
