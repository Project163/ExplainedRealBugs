In a project I am only interested in two errors.\r\n\r\n1. unexpected EOF during the initial TLS connection setup(with rustls backend)\r\n2. (when using openssl backend) Error code 5? (which is also basically the same thing as 1. i.e. connection reset during initial tls handshake)\r\n\r\nExamples of these errors,\r\n\r\nWith rustls backend,\r\n\r\n```rust\r\nCustom {\r\n    kind: Other,\r\n    error: Custom {\r\n        kind: UnexpectedEof,\r\n        error: \"tls handshake eof\",\r\n    },\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nWith openssl backend,\r\n\r\n```rust\r\nSsl(\r\n    Error {\r\n        code: ErrorCode(\r\n            5,\r\n        ),\r\n        cause: None,\r\n    },\r\n    X509VerifyResult {\r\n        code: 0,\r\n        error: \"ok\",\r\n    },\r\n)\r\n```\r\n\r\nI understand I have to downcast these traits into structs to be able to read them but I just can't figure out how or what type to down cast it to?\r\n\r\nThe `Custom` struct in `rustls` error is a private struct in `std::io` so I can't downcast it to that and there is no way to read the error without it. \r\n\r\n\r\nThe `Ssl` struct/object in `openssl` error is `openssl::ssl::Error`.\r\n\r\n`reqwest` doesn't re-export `openssl` so I installed `openssl = 0.10.41` but down casting it to this type just yields `None`.\r\n\r\nThen, Some one pointed out that `reqwest` uses `native-tls = 0.2.8` which uses, `openssl = 0.10.29` so I tried this version but it doesn't build anymore. \r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7921368/184524655-9335c29f-621c-4151-8c43-40d4e4aa128d.png)\r\n\r\n\r\nI am not sure if this is correct place to put this issue? I have tried my best to figure this out, also asked about it in some places and still no where close to solving this problem. It's just really frustrating and overly difficult to read the actual error. \r\n\r\n\r\nExample code, \r\n\r\n```rust\r\nuse std::error::Error;\r\nuse reqwest::Client;\r\n\r\n#[tokio::main]\r\nasync fn main() -> Result<(), std::io::Error> {\r\n    let client = Client::new();\r\n\r\n    match client.get(\"https://google.com\").send().await {\r\n        Ok(v) => {\r\n            println!(\"{:?}\", v.status());\r\n\r\n            println!(\"{:?}\", v.text().await);\r\n        }\r\n        Err(e) => {\r\n            if !e.is_connect() {\r\n                return Ok(())\r\n            }\r\n\r\n            let herror = e.source().unwrap().downcast_ref::<hyper::Error>().unwrap();\r\n\r\n            println!(\"{:?}\", e.to_string());\r\n            let serror = herror.source().unwrap();\r\n            println!(\"{:#?} \", serror,);\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n    \r\n    Ok(())\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n[Playground

the `l1` module to Alloy.\r\n\r\nTwo main concerns with this pr as it stands. Currently removed retrying from the l1 chain watcher provider since the `RetryClient` previously used is from `ethers` and I'm not seeing a good alternative. It also seems that the `reqwest::ClientBuilder` [does not offer a retry policy](https://github.com/seanmonstar/reqwest/issues/316).\r\n\r\nThe second concern is that the rpc `Log` type returned from the alloy provider does not hydrate the block information needed to construct the user deposit information. As in, it is missing the `l1 block number`, `l1 block hash`, and `log index` (within the block). As a work around, I've modified the log fetching to query each block's log set at a time so we can hydrate this information ourselves (assuming logs are returned in their canonical block ordering from the provider). It would be much more efficient for the provider to hydrate this data such that we can batch rpc requests. Especially since we currently set the range to be 1000 blocks starting at the provided block number.\r\n\r\n**Metadata**\r\n\r\nFixes #233
