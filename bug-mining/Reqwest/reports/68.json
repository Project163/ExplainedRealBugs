Hey!\r\n\r\nLooks like something is broken in Cloudflare workers runtime.\r\n\r\n#### Minimal example:\r\n\r\n```rust\r\n#[wasm_bindgen]\r\npub async fn handle() -> String {\r\n    let resp = match reqwest::get(\"https://wtfismyip.com/text\").await {\r\n        Ok(resp) => resp,\r\n        Err(err) => return err.to_string(),\r\n    };\r\n    let text = resp.text().await.unwrap();\r\n    text\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWith version 0.10 it works, but with 0.11 it falls into `Err` arm of the `match` statement.\r\n\r\n#### Error message:\r\n```\r\nbuilder error: JsValue(Error: The 'credentials'
