that's why I wrote that there is no \"direct\" way. ~Your solution has a minor drawback: `body` is lifetime-constrained by `response`, so if you want to return `body` from a function (for e.g. some function `async fn(url: &str) -> Result<impl Stream<Item = Result<Bytes>>>`), it is not easily possible without sth like [owning_ref](https://docs.rs/owning_ref/).~ I am tired...\r\n\r\nAnother way is to use [async-stream](https://docs.rs/async-stream) which does not have this problems, but instead you occasionally get weird compiler errors (see e.g.

Only `Response` itself can be converted with [bytes_stream](https://docs.rs/reqwest/latest/reqwest/struct.Response.html#method.bytes_stream). As well as into [bytes](https://docs.rs/reqwest/latest/reqwest/struct.Response.html#method.bytes).\r\n\r\nBut it's possible to wrap a `Stream` to `reqwest::Body`.\r\n\r\nSo I think it would be correct to go with this way:\r\n- expect `reqwest::Body`(or `Into<Body>`) if it's expected as a body of the request\r\n- return `reqwest::Response` if output type is binary (could be wrapper though, which contains `Stream` + `headers` for example)\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenAPITools/openapi-generator/issues/18117/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/OpenAPITools/openapi-generator/issues/18117/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
