This could either be a single constructor on the client, like `Client::unix_socket(\"/var/docker.sock\")`, or it could be considered a \"proxy\", and thus as suggested in #30, be something like `Proxy::unix(\"/var/docket.sock\")`.\r\n- Using the URL, something like [requests-unixsocket](https://github.com/msabramo/requests-unixsocket), with an example of `http+unix://%2Ftmp%2Fprofilesvc.sock/path/to/page`. This is a whole lot uglier, but allows all the semantics to exist in the `Url`, such as whether to use TLS, and is possibly easier to allow dynamic selection of which unix
