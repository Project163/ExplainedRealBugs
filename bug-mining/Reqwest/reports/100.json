That support was later ported to [`tower_http::follow_redirect`](https://docs.rs/tower-http/latest/tower_http/follow_redirect/index.html). To reduce duplication, and to make sure the `tower-http` code has all the improvements reqwest gets, we should just make reqwest depend on the one from `tower-http`.\n\nNote: the public APIs are a little different. To prevent a breaking change, we should make the refactor simply internal.\n\n## Implementation steps\n\nCurrently redirects are handled manually with this [loop](https://github.com/seanmonstar/reqwest/blob/2fd902ebbf20d77d901c5d84cdd04b39421bba4a/src/async_impl/client.rs#L2730) inside `PendingRequest`. Once a response is received, it checks if a redirect is required, and then loops again, or returns the response.\n\n- Make it so `ClientRef::hyper` field is `FollowRedirect<HyperClient>`.\n  - Create an internal struct that implements `tower_http::follow_redirect::Policy`, while holding the `reqwest::redirect::Policy` inside it.\n  - Remove that the policy is stored on the `ClientRef` (since it is now stored in the middleware.\n- Remove the `loop` mentioned above.\n  - Make sure any other code related to redirects is handled by the middleware (such as removing sensitive headers).","closed_by":{"login":"seanmonstar","id":51479,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxNDc5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/51479?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar","html_url":"https://github.com/seanmonstar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/seanmonstar/reqwest/issues/2576/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/seanmonstar/reqwest/issues/2576/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
