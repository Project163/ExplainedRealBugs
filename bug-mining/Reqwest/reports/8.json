You can see an example by running the `example.rs` with a bogus URL. It will print something like:\r\n\r\n```\r\nError: http://bogus.not.athing/: failed to lookup address information: Name or service not known\r\nCaused by: failed to lookup address information: Name or service not known\r\nCaused by: failed to lookup address information: Name or service not known\r\n```\r\n\r\n(That the \"caused by\" is duplicated is because `hyper::Error` suffers the same behavior, but ignore that).\r\n\r\nCompare to `std::io::Error`, where you can construct a new one from any other `std::error::Error`, like `io::Error::new(io::ErrorKind::Other, \"kaboom\")`. You can access `\"kaboom\"` from `err.get_ref()`. However, `err.cause()` does not return `\"kaboom\"`. It instead is essentially `err.get_ref().cause()`.\r\n\r\nIt may make sense to follow `io::Error` on this. Since `reqwest::Error` isn't being a 'higher level' error, but is indeed just wrapping it.","closed_by":{"login":"seanmonstar","id":51479,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxNDc5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/51479?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar","html_url":"https://github.com/seanmonstar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/seanmonstar/reqwest/issues/140/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/seanmonstar/reqwest/issues/140/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
