As far as I understand the `?` operator can only be used inside functions that return a `Result`. However in the examples this isn't mentioned. Simply running the first example:\r\n```rust\r\nlet text = reqwest::get(\"https://www.rust-lang.org\")?\r\n    .text()?;\r\n\r\nprintln!(\"body = {:?}\", body);\r\n```\r\nReturns `cannot use the ? operator in a function that returns ()` and `body not found in this scope`. Then changing the code to:\r\n```rust\r\nlet text = reqwest::get(\"https://www.rust-lang.org\")\r\n    .text();\r\n\r\nprintln!(\"text = {:?}\", text);\r\n```\r\nReturns `no method named text found for type std::result::Result<reqwest::Response, reqwest::Error>`, any help appreciated.","closed_by":{"login":"seanmonstar","id":51479,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxNDc5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/51479?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar","html_url":"https://github.com/seanmonstar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/seanmonstar/reqwest/issues/275/reactions","total_count":3,"+1":3,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/seanmonstar/reqwest/issues/275/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
