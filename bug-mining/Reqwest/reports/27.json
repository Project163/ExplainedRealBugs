Using this library, and working in Rust has been a huge step in the right direction! \r\n\r\nUnfortunately, because of reqwest's reliance on rust-native-tls, my program isn't portable between different openssl versions. I am not using any tls in my program, and am dealing solely with plain http requests, so I could certainly do without tls support.\r\n\r\nI am proposing, and offering to help implement, that we add a feature to the crate that will enable the switching of tls support on or off at compile time.  \r\n\r\nIn the end, I would like to be able to import reqwest in the following way:\r\n```\r\nreqwest = { version = \"*\", features = [\"no-tls\"] }\r\n```\r\nAnd be able to compile my program without any openssl dependancies.\r\n\r\nLet me know what this change would entail, and how I can get started.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nBrooks J Rady","closed_by":{"login":"seanmonstar","id":51479,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxNDc5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/51479?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar","html_url":"https://github.com/seanmonstar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/seanmonstar/reqwest/issues/225/reactions","total_count":7,"+1":7,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/seanmonstar/reqwest/issues/225/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
