Here's the behavior I'd expect:\r\n\r\n- `header`: Always appends.\r\n- `headers`: Replaces any existing headers for the same key, but then appends all values of the same key from the new `HeaderMap`.\r\n\r\nSo, I'd expect this behavior:\r\n\r\n```rust\r\nlet mut hdrs = HeaderMap::new();\r\nhdrs.insert(\"foo\", \"bar\".parse().unwrap());\r\nhdrs.append(\"foo\", \"baz\".parse().unwrap());\r\n\r\nclient\r\n    .get(url)\r\n    .header(\"im-a\", \"keeper\")\r\n    .header(\"foo\", \"pop me\");\r\n    .headers(hdrs)\r\n    // ...\r\n```\r\n\r\nThat should have a header map of the following:\r\n\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n    \"im-a\": [\"keeper\"],\r\n    \"foo\": [\"bar\", \"baz\"]\r\n}\r\n````","author_association":"OWNER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/seanmonstar/reqwest/issues/comments/451261024/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"seanmonstar","id":51479,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxNDc5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/51479?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar","html_url":"https://github.com/seanmonstar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":2053210306,"node_id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDIwNTMyMTAzMDY=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/seanmonstar/reqwest/issues/events/2053210306","actor":{"login":"seanmonstar","id":51479,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxNDc5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/51479?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar","html_url":"https://github.com/seanmonstar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-01-03T20:05:22Z","label":{"name":"bug","color":"ee0701"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2053253338,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MjA1MzI1MzMzOA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/seanmonstar/reqwest/issues/events/2053253338","actor":{"login":"seanmonstar","id":51479,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxNDc5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/51479?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar","html_url":"https://github.com/seanmonstar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":"9c0c5ca42db6cf6afdcc3596e0851ad057eed5cc","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/seanmonstar/reqwest/commits/9c0c5ca42db6cf6afdcc3596e0851ad057eed5cc","created_at":"2019-01-03T20:29:48Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":13638084352,"node_id":"REFE_lADOA7dkLM4Xdz-RzwAAAAMs5KcA","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/seanmonstar/reqwest/issues/events/13638084352","actor":{"login":"ptrsxu","id":1509894,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MDk4OTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1509894?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ptrsxu","html_url":"https://github.com/ptrsxu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ptrsxu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ptrsxu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ptrsxu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ptrsxu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ptrsxu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ptrsxu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ptrsxu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ptrsxu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ptrsxu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":fa
