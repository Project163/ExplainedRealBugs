However, if I want to load these files as a `Stream`, the `Content-Length` header and this causes most servers (such as those created with `warp`) to reject the body. After looking at the implementation details, it looks like `Part::stream` has no way to indicate its size, even when I manually implemented `http_body::Body` with a wrapper type due to the `WrapStream` type being used underneath the hood in the crate. I am trying to avoid reading large files into memory and then passing them as raw bytes.\r\n\r\nI was wondering if I could add a new method to `Part` called `stream_with_length(stream, length)` so that I can manually specify the length of the file I am sending. I'm perfectly willing to implement it, but just wanted to see if it would be something that would be accepted","closed_by":{"login":"seanmonstar","id":51479,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxNDc5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/51479?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar","html_url":"https://github.com/seanmonstar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/seanmonstar/reqwest/issues/1090/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/seanmonstar/reqwest/issues/1090/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
