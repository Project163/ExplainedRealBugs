Currently, this method is only available on Linux/Android, as it uses the Linux-specific socket option `SO_BINDTODEVICE`. \n\nOn BSD-like systems, including macOS, illumos, etc, similar functionality exists for IP sockets in the form of the `IP_BOUND_IF` socket option. Per the manual page `ip(4p)`:\n\n> IP_BOUND_IF\n>    Limit reception and transmission of packets to this interface. Takes an integer as an argument. The integer is the selected interface index.\n\nIt seems like `reqwest` could probably provide an implementation of the `ClientBuilder::interface` method on BSD-ish systems using this socket option. I'd be happy to contribute such an implementation if maintainers are open to it.","closed_by":{"login":"seanmonstar","id":51479,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxNDc5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/51479?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar","html_url":"https://github.com/seanmonstar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/seanmonstar/reqwest/issues/2571/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/seanmonstar/reqwest/issues/2571/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
