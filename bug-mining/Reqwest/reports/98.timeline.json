Perhaps CUBIC as default, and adding something like `ClientBuilder::http3_use_bbr`.

The list of `QUIC`/`quinn` configuration options people may want to expose is long. If it's too specific/bloaty to you, we can consider how to allow other `quinn`-specific configuration.\n\nI see you've mentioned the difficulty in allowing a generic connector in `reqwest`, and that's understandable. I wonder if exposing sub-configuration (dependent on feature `quinn` or `http3-quinn`, similarly to your `rustls-*` features) in the `ClientBuilder` makes sense.
