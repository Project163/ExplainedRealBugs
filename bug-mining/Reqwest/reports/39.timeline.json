everyone!\r\n\r\nI have been tinkering with the implementation of query_pairs_mut after looking at this [issue](https://github.com/seanmonstar/reqwest/issues/464) on the reqwest project. The core of the issue is that a serialization of an empty query insert a '?' at the end of the url.\r\n\r\n I went on to try and make the serialization of query_pairs_mut to only insert a trailing question mark after the first serialization. Making `url.query_pairs_mut().clear();` equivalent to `url.set_query(None)`.\r\n\r\nI don't know if this behaviour is desired on the rust-url side, but would like to know if this change is feasible.\n\n<!-- Reviewable:start -->\n---\nThis change is [<img src=\"https://reviewable.io/review_button.svg\" height=\"34\" align=\"absmiddle\"
