But it introduced the BOM bug unfortunately, and certainly it doesn't seem the BOM behaviour was intentional. Just an accident of copy avoidance done without the knowledge that the Cow::Borrowed may not be the full slice, but just a part of it.\r\n\r\nA bunch of refactorings later, the current code no longer avoids a copy because it does `full.to_vec()` and `to_vec()` copies, so fixing the BOM bug won't introduce any copying. Whether there is still a way to avoid it, I don't know (yet), but we can sort that out later.","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/seanmonstar/reqwest/issues/comments/1621701349/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":2,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"liskin","id":300342,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwMDM0Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/300342?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/liskin","html_url":"https://github.com/liskin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liskin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liskin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liskin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liskin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liskin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liskin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liskin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liskin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liskin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/seanmonstar/reqwest/issues/comments/1621721719","html_url":"https://github.com/seanmonstar/reqwest/issues/1897#issuecomment-1621721719","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/seanmonstar/reqwest/issues/1897","id":1621721719,"node_id":"IC_kwDOA7dkLM5gqYJ3","user":{"login":"seanmonstar","id":51479,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxNDc5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/51479?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar","html_url":"https://github.com/seanmonstar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-07-05T13:05:58Z","updated_at":"2023-07-05T13:05:58Z","body":"Oh, indeed I did.
