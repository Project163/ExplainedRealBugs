\r\nI'm not that high level skilled in rust, but i can find my way.\r\nI was looking at the code, and am a bit puzzled as where the best place is to put this.\r\n\r\nI figured the best thing would be to add it to the `ProxyScheme` or a bit more global in the `Intercept` enum. But i'm a bit at a loss where to start and where/how to add it.\r\n\r\nBecause i think i need to catch it in the `Proxy::intercept()` call, and return `None` in case the `Dst.host()` matches the NO_PROXY value. So i probably need to have something available within that function, which can do that pattern checking.\r\n\r\nIf possible, could you point me in a bit in the right direction?\r\nThx in advance

from https://github.com/coreos/fedora-coreos-tracker/issues/379#issuecomment-583716013.\r\n\r\nZincati currently supports fetching HTTP content through proxies specified via environment variables. However, proxy configuration is applied to all HTTP requests. In some cases, it would helpful to exclude some endpoints which cannot be meaningfully fetched over proxies (e.g. `localhost` endpoint). At the moment the HTTP library `reqwest`  that we are using does not support that.\r\nIn order to fix this, we should either:\r\n * implement the `reqwest` fix for https://github.com/seanmonstar/reqwest/issues/705\r\n * have some custom exclusion knob in Zincati (for Cincinnati and FleetLock
