been trying to write this, and have run up against a couple of issues. First, I planned on actually writing two `From<http::Response>` implementations, one for `async_impl::Response` and one for `Response`. The impl for `async_impl::Response` is fairly straightforward, except for the fact that `async_impl::Response` expects a `Box<Url>` with the final URL. `http::Response` doesn't have this data (or at least, doesn't expose it through it's API), so right now I'm using the `.extensions()` mechanism to retrieve a `Url` from the `http::Response`. However, that returns an `Option` so I'm not sure what to do if there is no `Url`. Some sentinel value perhaps?\r\n\r\nThe other issue is that `Response` carries a reference to the `InnerClientHandle` through the `KeepCoreThreadAlive` type, and I have no idea how to get that from just a `From<http::Response>` impl.\r\n\r\nDo you have any thoughts on this
