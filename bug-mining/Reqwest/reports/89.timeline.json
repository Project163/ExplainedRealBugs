your [other URLO-topic](https://users.rust-lang.org/t/a-proxy-with-axum-0-7-and-reqwest-0-12-based-on-http-1/112489/5?u=jofas) is also somewhat related:\r\n\r\n> I tried [`reqwest::Body::wrap_stream`](https://docs.rs/reqwest/latest/reqwest/struct.Body.html#method.wrap_stream) with both [`axum::Body::into_data_stream`](https://docs.rs/axum/latest/axum/body/struct.Body.html#method.into_data_stream) and [`http_body_util::BodyStream`](https://docs.rs/http-body-util/0.1.1/http_body_util/struct.BodyStream.html), both failed because `axum::body::Body` is not [`Sync`](https://docs.rs/axum/latest/axum/body/struct.Body.html#impl-Sync-for-Body).\r\n\r\n#2088 seems to be at least partially motivated by the need to use axum's `BodyDataStream` with reqwest's `Body` type:\r\n\r\n> By using [`SyncWrapper`](https://docs.rs/sync_wrapper/latest/sync_wrapper/struct.SyncWrapper.html) we can avoid requiring `Sync` for the stream passed to `Body::wrap_stream`. This makes it easier to use streams like axum's [`BodyDataStream`](https://docs.rs/axum-core/latest/axum_core/body/struct.BodyDataStream.html).\r\n\r\nI think it was indeed just an accident that the `Sync` bound was reintroduced in #2059, at least that is how I interpret
