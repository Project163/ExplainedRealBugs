to the [builders API guideline](https://github.com/brson/rust-api-guidelines#c-builder), we like &mut self builders.\r\n\r\nThe RequestBuilder method signatures should change to &mut self:\r\n\r\n```diff\r\n- fn(self, ...) -> Self\r\n+ fn(&mut self, ...) -> &mut Self\r\n```\r\n\r\nAlso they should fail fast where applicable:\r\n\r\n```diff\r\n- fn(self, ...) -> Self /* eventually error when send is called */\r\n+ fn(&mut self, ...) -> Result<&mut Self, Error>\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe state inside the builder should be stored in a way that enables `send` (or any other terminal method) to accept &mut self as well but take ownership of the state inside, for example by storing `Option<T>` from which the terminal method can `take()` the value.\r\n\r\nAny further use of the builder after `send` has been called should panic, and this behavior should be documented.","closed_by":{"login":"seanmonstar","id":51479,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxNDc5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/51479?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar","html_url":"https://github.com/seanmonstar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/seanmonstar/reqwest/issues/108/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/seanmonstar/reqwest/issues/108/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
