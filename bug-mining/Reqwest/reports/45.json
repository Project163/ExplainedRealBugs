I strongly disagree with https://github.com/seanmonstar/reqwest/issues/30#issuecomment-271714181 that reqwest should not handle the system proxies automatically. I think it should use them by default, and for the rare where proxies should not be used, a builder can be used to disable them.\r\n\r\nThink of the thousands of command line utilities that do http requests that were only tested in environnements that work without proxies (my last example being https://github.com/gobanos/cargo-aoc/blob/54e0a80a9bd7dc339c7d2c9dbbf43076d9112e3a/src/app.rs#L66 ). Do they all need to add code to explicitly say they want to use the user's configured proxy ?\r\n\r\nAs mentionned in https://github.com/seanmonstar/reqwest/issues/30#issuecomment-266336609 the crate env_proxy https://crates.io/crates/env_proxy can be used for basic support.\r\n\r\nIdeally, more system methods would be recognized (java has support for the windows registry and for gnome gconf : see https://github.com/openjdk-mirror/jdk7u-jdk/blob/f4d80957e89a19a29bb9f9807d2a28351ed7f7df/src/windows/native/sun/net/spi/DefaultProxySelector.c  and https://github.com/openjdk-mirror/jdk7u-jdk/blob/f4d80957e89a19a29bb9f9807d2a28351ed7f7df/src/solaris/native/sun/net/spi/DefaultProxySelector.c )\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\nJon","closed_by":{"login":"seanmonstar","id":51479,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxNDc5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/51479?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar","html_url":"https://github.com/seanmonstar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/seanmonstar/reqwest/issues/403/reactions","total_count":5,"+1":5,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/seanmonstar/reqwest/issues/403/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
