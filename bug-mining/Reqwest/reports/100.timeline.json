What does this want to do\r\n\r\nWorking on https://github.com/seanmonstar/reqwest/issues/2576\r\n\r\nThis PR mainly split the redirect logic in the `loop` into three place\r\n-  Let `FollowRedirect<S, P>` to decide whether a redirection is needed\r\n-  Let the `HyperService` and `H3Client` to handle the `cookies`, `H3Client` had implemented the `Service` trait as well.\r\n-  Let the `TowerRedirectPolicy` to handle the other logics, like check the `URI`, `remove_sensitive_headers`, insert`referer` header\r\n\r\nThere is still exists  the `retry` logic  in the `loop`,  I don't  really want to copy them into `HyperService` and `H3Client`. \r\n\r\n## How to test\r\n\r\nThe first commit add the `Limit` and `Custom` policy test.
