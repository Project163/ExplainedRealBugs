building a client API based on reqwest, I would often want to modify or inspect the private fields on `RequestBuilder`, namely method, url, headers and body.\r\n\r\nSince they are private, you basically have to create your own builder and convert it, which is annoying.\r\n\r\nWhat do you think about either making the fields public or providing getters/setters?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/seanmonstar/reqwest/issues/85/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/seanmonstar/reqwest/issues/85/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/seanmonstar/reqwest/issues/comments/305251763","html_url":"https://github.com/seanmonstar/reqwest/issues/108#issuecomment-305251763","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/seanmonstar/reqwest/issues/108","id":305251763,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMwNTI1MTc2Mw==","user":{"login":"seanmonstar","id":51479,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxNDc5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/51479?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar","html_url":"https://github.com/seanmonstar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-05-31T17:01:42Z","updated_at":"2017-05-31T17:01:42Z","body":"Adding

would be a new type, discussed in #85.

self.request_mut().set_body(Body::from(json));\r\n        self\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThere would be 2 public methods on the builder to \"consume\" it:\r\n\r\n```rust\r\nimpl RequestBuilder {\r\n

I've been going through and refactoring the `RequestBuilder` struct (#22), it feels like getting it to verify that it was set up successfully, then also send itself while making sure to handling redirects properly is a lot of work for a simple builder to do. \r\n\r\nNormally you would use the builder pattern to just configure an object, check it was set up properly, and then pass that onto something else so operations can be done with it. I've also been fighting the borrow checker *a lot* due to the fact that every `RequestBuilder` holds a reference back to its client, although that could just be because I'm doing something silly.\r\n\r\nInstead, would it make sense to construct a request and then pass it to the client to send as two distinct steps? I'm imagining a google search might look like this:\r\n\r\n```rust\r\nuse reqwest::{Client, Request, RequestBuilder};\r\nuse std::collections::HashMap;\r\n\r\nfn main() {\r\n  let url = \"https://google.com/\";\r\n  let mut data = HashMap::new();\r\n  data.insert(\"q\", \"wikipedia\");\r\n\r\n  let client = Client::New().unwrap();\r\n\r\n  let req: Request = RequestBuilder::get(url)\r\n      .form(data)\r\n      .verify()\r\n      .unwrap();\r\n\r\n  let response = client.send(req).unwrap();\r\n  println!(\"{}\", response.status());\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd for convenience you might have the top level `get()` and `post()` methods which internally create a new client, set up the request, get the client to send that request, and then return the response.\r\n\r\nI guess the biggest change for users would be that a `Request` and `Client` are less tightly coupled, meaning you have to fight the borrow checker a lot less since your requests no longer have references to a client. It'll also make our lives a lot easier when we have to change everything to work with the asynchronous hyper release.\r\n\r\nThat said, it's a non-trivial change to the library's API so you've got to think about backwards compatibility and what is the most ergonomic for users to use. I'll look to see how other libraries have done it, but I'd be interested in seeing what everyone else's thoughts are.\r\n\r\ncc: @seanmonstar

most usages (if there will be changes needed to begin with).\r\n\r\nThis means that `build` cannot possibly panic anymore due to being called multiple times.
