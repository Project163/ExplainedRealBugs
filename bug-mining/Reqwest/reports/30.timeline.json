have some users behind a corporate proxy. They have environment variables set up for `http_proxy` and `https_proxy`. Example value: `http_proxy=http://MyUser:MyPassword@10.40.10.10:8080/`. I've tried using this exact value and passed it into `Proxy::http()`, but all they get is `unsuccessful tunnel` errors. Additionally, I've tried setting the `Proxy-Authorization` header as a default header for my reqwest Client. I've also tried setting this header and then removing the basic auth form the `http_proxy` url and use that for `Proxy::http()`. All to no success, they are getting this error message.\r\n\r\nHere's the code creating the client: [client.rs](https://github.com/Rukenshia/saml2aws-auto/blob/master/src/client.rs).
