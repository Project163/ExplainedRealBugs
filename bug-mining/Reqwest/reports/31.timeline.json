I think disabling it on Windows is a good idea until trust-dns gets a fix. Either it needs to ignore the nameservers from these adapters, or it needs to query them in parallel, or it needs to have a shorter timeout that doesn't elapse before it's tried every nameserver, or whatever.\r\n\r\nIt's not really about \"a lot of adapters\" or \"adapters that don't work\". Having adapters that don't have an internet connection is quite normal. VM software like Hyper-V and VirtualBox, VPN software, etc all add virtual adapters. These adapters *work*, and `getaddrinfo` already knows about which adapter's nameservers it's supposed to use. But trust-dns goes behind the OS's back to make its own list of nameservers and gets confused by it.\r\n\r\nEspecially in the VPN case, I imagine it'll also end up leaking internal domain names over the public internet where gai would've resolved them by the VPN network's DNS server.","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/seanmonstar/reqwest/issues/comments/453605854/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"Arnavion","id":1096010,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwOTYwMTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1096010?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Arnavion","html_url":"https://github.com/Arnavion","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Arnavion/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Arnavion/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Arnavion/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Arnavion/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Arnavion/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Arnavion/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Arnavion/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Arnavion/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Arnavion/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/seanmonstar/reqwest/issues/comments/453613288","html_url":"https://github.com/seanmonstar/reqwest/issues/431#issuecomment-453613288","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/seanmonstar/reqwest/issues/431","id":453613288,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ1MzYxMzI4OA==","user":{"login":"bluejekyll","id":986845,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk4Njg0NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/986845?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluejekyll","html_url":"https://github.com/bluejekyll","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluejekyll/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluejekyll/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluejekyll/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluejekyll/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluejekyll/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluejekyll/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluejekyll/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluejekyll/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bluejekyll/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-01-11T18:32:22Z","updated_at":"2019-01-11T18:32:22Z","body":"There's currently one primary contributor to trust-dns for Windows.
