I'll open a PR in a few days, as soon as I get some time :)\r\n\r\n> Also, I'm curious, how does a user on Windows normally indicate that they should use HTTPS to talk directly to the proxy?\r\n\r\nAs far as I could tell (by studying other tools/libraries and reading articles), it's very unlikely for an HTTPS proxy to actually use HTTPS between the client and the proxy (for example, see: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/516323/https-connections-over-proxy-servers). Instead, HTTP proxies would handle HTTPS by converting it to a TCP/IP tunnel, which is completely blind about the HTTPS data being transmitted (as it's encrypted).\r\n\r\nI experimented with Python, and by specifying HTTPS proxy + HTTPS protocol it works, but I'm reasonably sure that under the hoods it's communicating with the Proxy using the HTTP protocol.\r\nAnother example would be `curl`. For instance, using the same proxy configuration as the previous ticket, we get that:\r\n\r\n```\r\n# This hangs and then fail\r\nhttps_proxy=https://127.0.0.1:8888 curl -I https://google.com\r\n\r\n# This works correctly\r\nhttps_proxy=http://127.0.0.1:8888 curl -I https://google.com\r\n```\r\n\r\nBecause in some limited cases a user might still want to use HTTPS to communicate with the proxy, what about defaulting the protocol to HTTP if not explicitly specified?\r\n\r\nFor example, the following Registry entry:\r\n```\r\nhttp=127.0.0.1:8888;https=127.0.0.1:8888\r\n```\r\nwould get interpreted as:\r\n```\r\nHTTP_PROXY=http://127.0.0.1:8888\r\nHTTPS_PROXY=http://127.0.0.1:8888\r\n```\r\nBut the user could specify the HTTPS protocol explicitly:\r\n```\r\nhttp=http://127.0.0.1:8888;https=https://127.0.0.1:8888\r\n```\r\nwhich could be translated to:\r\n```\r\nHTTP_PROXY=http://127.0.0.1:8888\r\nHTTPS_PROXY=https://127.0.0.1:8888\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis way, we provide a good default without limiting the user. What do you think?\r\n\r\n","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/seanmonstar/reqwest/issues/comments/724266462/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"federico-terzi","id":20475953,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwNDc1OTUz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20475953?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/federico-terzi","html_url":"https://github.com/federico-terzi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/federico-terzi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/federico-terzi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/federico-terzi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/federico-terzi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/federico-terzi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/federico-terzi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/federico-terzi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/federico-terzi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/federico-terzi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":3975717617,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50Mzk3NTcxNzYxNw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/seanmonstar/reqwest/issues/events/3975717617","actor":{"login":"seanmonstar","id":51479,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxNDc5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/51479?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar","html_url":"https://github.com/seanmonstar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-11-09T20:42:18Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3975717627,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDM5NzU3MTc2Mjc=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/seanmonstar/reqwest/issues/events/3975717627","actor":{"login":"seanmonstar","id":51479,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxNDc5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/51479?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar","html_url":"https://github.com/seanmonstar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-11-09T20:42:18Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/seanmonstar/reqwest/issues/comments/724295207","html_url":"https://github.com/seanmonstar/reqwest/issues/1080#issuecomment-724295207","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/seanmonstar/reqwest/issues/1080","id":724295207,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDcyNDI5NTIwNw==","user":{"login":"seanmonstar","id":51479,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxNDc5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/51479?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar","html_url":"https://github.com/seanmonstar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sean
