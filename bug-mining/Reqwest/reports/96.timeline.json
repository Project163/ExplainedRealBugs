**Re-enable ability to set NoProxy via env on windows**\n- **Fix the behavior of `NoProxy::from_env` to match docs**\nCloses #2599\n    \nIn #2559, the behavior of no proxy handling on windows was changed to\neffectively only read from the current user's `Internet Settings` in the\nregistry on Windows. This meant that NO_PROXY env vars were no longer\nrespected on Windows. This commit changes that behavior and at least\nbrings it in line with dotnet and nuget behavior (two microsoft\nprojects) of first checking env vars and only if they are not set, check\nthe registry settings.\n\nAdditionally, this fixes the behavior of `NoProxy::from_env` to match its\ndocumentation. This changes the behavior of `NoProxy::from_env` if `NO_PROXY`\nor `no_proxy` is set to an empty string. Previously, it would have returned\n`None`, which is not what the documentation says should happen. It now returns\nan `Some(NoProxy::default())` which should functionally be the same thing for\nthe purposes of not matching anything with the proxy.\n    \nThis second change was done due to potential interaction with previous commit\nfixing #2599. I would expect that setting `NO_PROXY` to an empty string would\nalso prevent reqwest from reading the registry settings.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/seanmonstar/reqwest/issues/2601/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/seanmonstar/reqwest/issues/2601/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":16785621743,"node_id":"REFE_lADOA7dkLM6t6sjszwAAAAPogELv","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/seanmonstar/reqwest/issues/events/16785621743","actor":{"login":"drewkett","id":2132248,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMzIyNDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2132248?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/drewkett","html_url":"https://github.com/drewkett","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drewkett/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drewkett/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drewkett/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drewkett/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drewkett/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drewkett/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drewkett/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drewkett/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drewkett/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"99f6a464fd5bc9be841704e16471ed3e12024f49","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/drewkett/reqwest/commits/99f6a464fd5bc9be841704e16471ed3e12024f49","created_at":"2025-03-15T14:02:20Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"actor":{"login":"zanieb","id":2586601,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1ODY2MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2586601?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zanieb","html_url":"https://github.com/zanieb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zanieb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zanieb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zanieb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zanieb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zanieb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zanieb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zanieb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zanieb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zanieb/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-03-18T13:37:43Z","updated_at":"2025-03-18T13:37:43Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/astral-sh/uv/issues/12262","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/astral-sh/uv","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/astral-sh/uv/issues/12262/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/astral-sh/uv/issues/12262/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/astral-sh/uv/issues/12262/events","html_url":"https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/12262","id":2927613165,"node_id":"I_kwDOKbIFZc6uf9Tt","number":12262,"title":"uv
