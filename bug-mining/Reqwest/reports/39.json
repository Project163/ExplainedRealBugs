Here is a test that shows the behavior:\r\n\r\nhttps://play.rust-lang.org/?version=stable&mode=debug&edition=2018&gist=1647711889f5df31a99edbe18ce59256\r\n\r\nFundamentally, I find it strange that reqwest would generate such URLs, since it's never useful to have the extra ? at the end if it's not followed by any query parameters. It also makes it harder for me to write integration tests, because I have to explicitly encode the ? in the expected path for the request, even though it doesn't belong there.\r\n\r\nOf course, you can just not call `query()` if you don't have any parameters, but that makes the `RequestBuilder` a lot more awkward to use. Here's my use case:\r\n\r\nI want to write this:\r\n```rust\r\nlet results: Vec<SearchResult> = client\r\n    .get(&url)\r\n    .headers(headers)\r\n    .query(&self.get_query_params())\r\n    .send()?\r\n    .json()?;\r\n```\r\nIn my case, `get_query_params()` may or may not return parameters, depending on the state of the system.\r\n\r\nBut instead I have to write something like this:\r\n```rust\r\nlet mut request = client.get(&url).headers(headers);\r\n\r\nlet params = self.get_query_params();\r\nif params.is_some() {\r\n    request = request.query(&params);\r\n}\r\n\r\nlet results: Vec<SearchResult> = request.send()?.json()?;\r\n```","closed_by":{"login":"seanmonstar","id":51479,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxNDc5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/51479?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar","html_url":"https://github.com/seanmonstar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/seanmonstar/reqwest/issues/464/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/seanmonstar/reqwest/issues/464/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
