 ## Example
 
-Async:
+This asynchronous example uses [Tokio](https://tokio.rs) and enables some
+optional features, so your `Cargo.toml` could look like this:
+
+```toml
+[dependencies]
+reqwest = { version = "0.10", features = ["json"] }
+tokio = { version = "0.2", features = ["full"] }
+```
+
+And then the code:
 
 ```rust,no_run
 use std::collections::HashMap;
 
 #[tokio::main]
 async fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
-    let resp: HashMap<String, String> = reqwest::get("https://httpbin.org/ip")
+    let resp = reqwest::get("https://httpbin.org/ip")
         .await?
-        .json()
+        .json::<HashMap<String, String>>()
         .await?;
     println!("{:#?}", resp);
     Ok(())
 }
 ```
 
-Blocking:
+## Blocking Client
+
+There is an optional "blocking" client API that can be enabled:
+
+```toml
+[dependencies]
+reqwest = { version = "0.10", features = ["blocking", "json"] }
+```
 
 ```rust,no_run
 use std::collections::HashMap;
 
 fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
-    let resp: HashMap<String, String> = reqwest::blocking::get("https://httpbin.org/ip")?
-        .json()?;
+    let resp = reqwest::blocking::get("https://httpbin.org/ip")?
+        .json::<HashMap<String, String>>()?;
     println!("{:#?}", resp);
     Ok(())
 }
