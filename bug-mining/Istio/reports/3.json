We have been testing Delta and devloping on it for 5+ releases. IMO next release is as good as any to turn it on.\r\n\r\nI think this basically just needs a PR to flip the flag, switching the test to have a single sotw workload instead of a single delta one (as rest will all be delta), a release note + upgrade note (even though its compatible, its a big change so good to give it proper notice).\r\n\r\nAdditionally, in the future any changes to delta (to make it more incremental) probably should be behind a new flag like DELTA_XDS_EXPERIMENTAL, so we can graduate optimizations from new -> experimental -> GA; otherwise any such change is fairly risky.\r\n\r\ncc @kyessenov @keithmattix @ramaraochavali @hzxuzhonghu  ","closed_by":{"login":"istio-testing","id":25311884,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1MzExODg0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25311884?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/istio-testing","html_url":"https://github.com/istio-testing","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/istio-testing/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/istio-testing/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/istio-testing/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/istio-testing/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/istio-testing/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/istio-testing/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/istio-testing/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/istio-testing/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/istio-testing/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/istio/istio/issues/47949/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/istio/istio/issues/47949/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
