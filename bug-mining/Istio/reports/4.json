or alternatively, if we decide not to fix the template so it \"just works\" should we upgrade the handler to have a meaningful reply if `ztunnel` doesn't have the writable location it requires?\n\ncc: @ilrudie @bleggett \n\n\n### Version\n\n```Text\n% istioctl version\nclient version: 1.21.0\ncontrol plane version: 1.21.0\ndata plane version: 1.21.0 (25 proxies)\n\n% kubectl version\nClient Version: v1.29.0\nKustomize Version: v5.0.4-0.20230601165947-6ce0bf390ce3\nServer Version: v1.28.3-gke.1118000\n```\n\n\n### Additional Information\n\n_No response_","closed_by":{"login":"istio-testing","id":25311884,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1MzExODg0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25311884?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/istio-testing","html_url":"https://github.com/istio-testing","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/istio-testing/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/istio-testing/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/istio-testing/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/istio-testing/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/istio-testing/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/istio-testing/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/istio-testing/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/istio-testing/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/istio-testing/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/istio/istio/issues/50060/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/istio/istio/issues/50060/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
