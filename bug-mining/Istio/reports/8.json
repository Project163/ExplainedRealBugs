This approach provides consistency with other components that expose configurable resources.\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\n1. Using gatewayclass or gateway annotations to configure waypoint resources, e.g. `networking.istio.io/waypoint-cpu-requests: 500m`. This approach provides consistency in customizing an ingress gateway but will be superseded in the future by the following option.\r\n2. With https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/gateway-api/pull/2924, gateway `parametersRef` can manage waypoint resources. However, this requires considerable API changes to implement. \r\n\r\n**Affected product area (please put an X in all that apply)**\r\n\r\n[X] Ambient\r\n[ ] Docs\r\n[ ] Dual Stack\r\n[ ] Installation\r\n[ ] Networking\r\n[ ] Performance and Scalability\r\n[ ] Extensions and Telemetry\r\n[ ] Security\r\n[ ] Test and Release\r\n[ ] User Experience\r\n[ ] Developer Infrastructure\r\n\r\n**Affected features (please put an X in all that apply)**\r\n\r\n[ ] Multi Cluster\r\n[ ] Virtual Machine\r\n[ ] Multi Control Plane\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\n\r\nWaypoint resources are currently defined as:\r\n```\r\nresources:\r\n  limits:\r\n    cpu: \"2\"\r\n    memory: 1Gi\r\n  requests:\r\n    cpu: 100m\r\n    memory: 128Mi\r\n```\r\n\r\nxref discussion: https://github.com/istio/istio/discussions/51252","closed_by":{"login":"istio-testing","id":25311884,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1MzExODg0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25311884?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/istio-testing","html_url":"https://github.com/istio-testing","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/istio-testing/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/istio-testing/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/istio-testing/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/istio-testing/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/istio-testing/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/istio-testing/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/istio-testing/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/istio-testing/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/istio-testing/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/istio/istio/issues/51496/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/istio/istio/issues/51496/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
