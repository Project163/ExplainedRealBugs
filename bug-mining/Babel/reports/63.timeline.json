Fork the repo\r\n1. Run `git clone https://github.com/<YOUR_USERNAME>/babel.git && cd babel`\r\n1. Run `yarn && make bootstrap`\r\n1. Wait :hourglass_flowing_sand: \r\n1. Run `make watch` (or `make build` whenever you change a file)\r\n1. Add a test (only `input.js` and `exec.js`; `output.js` will be automatically generated)\r\n1. Update the code!\r\n1. `yarn jest class-properties` to run the tests\r\n    - If some test outputs don't match but the new results are correct, you can delete the bad `output.js` files and run the tests again\r\n    - If you prefer, you can run `OVERWRITE=true yarn jest [name-of-the-package-to-test]` and they will be automatically updated.\r\n1. If it is working, run `make test` to run all the tests\r\n1. Run `git push` and open a PR!","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/babel/babel/issues/comments/863311064/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"nicolo-ribaudo","id":7000710,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcwMDA3MTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7000710?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicolo-ribaudo","html_url":"https://github.com/nicolo-ribaudo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicolo-ribaudo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicolo-ribaudo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicolo-ribaudo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicolo-ribaudo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicolo-ribaudo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicolo-ribaudo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicolo-ribaudo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicolo-ribaudo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicolo-ribaudo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/babel/babel/issues/comments/863727682","html_url":"https://github.com/babel/babel/issues/12737#issuecomment-863727682","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/babel/babel/issues/12737","id":863727682,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDg2MzcyNzY4Mg==","user":{"login":"iamfotx","id":20137243,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwMTM3MjQz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20137243?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/iamfotx","html_url":"https://github.com/iamfotx","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iamfotx/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iamfotx/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iamfotx/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iamfotx/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iamfotx/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iamfotx/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iamfotx/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iamfotx/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iamfotx/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-06-18T03:28:35Z","updated_at":"2021-06-18T03:28:35Z","body":"@nicolo-ribaudo
