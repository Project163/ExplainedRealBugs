(This is unique to `parseYield` because it needs to check for `*` after `yield`; `parseAwait` for instance needs no such check.) Currently `tokenizer/types`’ `types.hash` lacks `beforeExpr`, which causes the bug. I’ll make a pull request fixing this soon. Thanks to @thiagoarrais for discovering it.
