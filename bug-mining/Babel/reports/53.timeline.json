This causes a ReferenceError at runtime. This output only occurs when running a 'build' with both minification and scope hoisting enabled.\r\n\r\nI have looked into this and I found that `mangeScope` tries to rename a binding to a class but it does not rename all references to the class.\r\n\r\n## 🎛 Configuration (.babelrc, package.json, cli command)\r\n\r\n<!--- If describing a bug, tell us what your babel configuration looks like -->\r\nhttps://github.com/regiontog/parcel2-bug\r\n\r\n## 🤔 Expected Behavior\r\n\r\n<!--- Tell us what should happen -->\r\nCode provided in minimal project above should run without a ReferenceError. \r\n\r\n## 😯 Current Behavior\r\n\r\n<!--- Tell us what happens instead of the expected behavior -->\r\n<!--- If you are seeing an error, please include the full error message and stack trace -->\r\n```\r\nReferenceError: $ab990cecfaab6ff29180e1961614b8cd$var$Item is not definedparcel2-bug.e18fda96.js:formatted:6\r\n    get parcel2-bug.e18fda96.js:6\r\n    <anonymous> parcel2-bug.e18fda96.js:10\r\n    <anonymous> parcel2-bug.e18fda96.js:11\r\n```\r\n\r\n## 💁 Possible Solution\r\n\r\n<!--- Not obligatory, but suggest a fix/reason for the bug -->\r\nI think this is a bug in [babel](https://github.com/babel/babel/issues/10896). So a possible fix would involve upgrading babel when they push a fix. Another possibility would be to not rely on `scope.crawl()` from babel, as that seems to be where the bug is. But I don't know if that is a viable option, maybe in some cases it can be avoided?\r\n\r\n## 💻 Code Sample\r\n\r\n<!-- Please provide a code repository, gist, code snippet or sample files to reproduce the issue -->\r\n```js\r\nclass Item {\r\n    constructor() { }\r\n\r\n    get() {\r\n        return new Item();\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\nconst item = new Item(); // This is fine\r\nitem.get(); // But this causes a ReferenceError\r\n```\r\n\r\n## 🌍 Your Environment\r\n\r\n<!--- Include as many relevant details about the environment you experienced the bug in -->\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nnpx envinfo\r\n  System:\r\n    OS: Linux 4.4 Ubuntu 18.04.2 LTS (Bionic Beaver)\r\n    CPU: (16) x64 AMD Ryzen 7 3700X 8-Core Processor\r\n    Memory: 6.58 GB / 15.95 GB\r\n    Container: Yes\r\n    Shell: 5.4.2 - /bin/zsh\r\n  Binaries:\r\n    Node: 13.3.0 - ~/.nvm/versions/node/v13.3.0/bin/node\r\n    Yarn: 1.21.1 - /usr/bin/yarn\r\n    npm: 6.13.1 - ~/.nvm/versions/node/v13.3.0/bin/npm\r\n  npmPackages:\r\n    core-js: ^3.5.0 => 3.5.0\r\n    parcel: ^2.0.0-alpha.3.2 => 2.0.0-alpha.3.2\r\n```\r\n\r\n<!-- Love parcel?

Therefore after crawling the binding `a` can still be accessed in the following two nodes. \r\n\r\n```\r\nProgram.bindings.a\r\nClassDeclaration.bindings.a ==> ClassDeclaration.bindings.a before crawl\r\n                              (getBinding returns existent old binding info)\r\n==> Program.bindings.a before crawl\r\n```\r\nBut `ClassDeclaration.bindings.a` refers to the binding generated _before_ `scope.crawl()`, so the referencePaths is screwed up because it is assigned to the binding _before_ crawl.\r\n\r\nWe can walk up from `path.scope.parent` instead of `path.scope`, so that we avoid accessing obsolete binding information.","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/babel/babel/issues/comments/572778593/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"JLHwung","id":3607926,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2MDc5MjY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3607926?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JLHwung","html_url":"https://github.com/JLHwung","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JLHwung/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JLHwung/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JLHwung/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JLHwung/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JLHwung/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JLHwung/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JLHwung/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JLHwung/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JLHwung/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":2936627875,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MjkzNjYyNzg3NQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/babel/babel/issues/events/2936627875","actor":{"login":"regiontog","id":9137819,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkxMzc4MTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9137819?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/regiontog","html_url":"https://github.com/regiontog","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/regiontog/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/regiontog/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/regiontog/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/regiontog/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/regiontog/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/regiontog/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/regiontog/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/regiontog/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/regiontog/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-01-09T22:07:14Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2936627877,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDI5MzY2Mjc4Nzc=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/babel/babel/issues/events/2936627877","actor":{"login":"regiontog","id":9137819,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkxMzc4MTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9137819?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/regiontog","html_url":"https://github.com/regiontog","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/regiontog/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/regiontog/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/regiontog/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/regiontog/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/regiontog/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/regiontog/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/regiontog/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/regiontog/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/regiontog/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-01-09T22:07:14Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2936628479,"node_id":"MDE0OlVubGFiZWxlZEV2ZW50MjkzNjYyODQ3OQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/babel/babel/issues/events/2936628479","actor":{"login":"JLHwung","id":3607926,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2MDc5MjY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3607926?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JLHwung","html_url":"https://github.com/JLHwung","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JLHwung/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JLHwung/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JLHwung/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JLHwung/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JLHwung/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JLHwung/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JLHwung/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JLHwung/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JLHwung/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"unlabeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-01-09T22:07:26Z","label":{"name":"i:
