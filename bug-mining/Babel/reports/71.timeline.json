to how the `@babel/core` dependency is managed for the localize NPM package, the version should be locked. Also the version should correspond to the version we install for building & testing.\r\n\r\nCurrently the Babel version allowed by the compiler-cli may not work given the ESM -> CJS interop. causing errors like:\r\n\r\n```\r\nimport { types as t } from \"@babel/core\";\r\n         ^^^^^\r\nSyntaxError: Named export 'types' not found. The requested module '@babel/core' is a CommonJS module, which may not support all module.exports as named exports.\r\nCommonJS modules can always be imported via the default export, for example using:\r\n\r\nimport pkg from '@babel/core';\r\nconst { types: t } = pkg;\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe can only be confident about the interop if we know the version installed- is the one we test. The error above\r\ndoes not surface in integration tests because the Angular CLI brings a more recent Babel version. In components\r\nthis failed because we had an older version of Babel that breaks the NodeJS CJS/ESM interop.\r\n\r\nNotes: \r\n\r\n* It previously worked because we had a \"hacky\" file to make the `@babel/core` import work (back when the repo also executed the linker code as CommonJS).  See: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/61e69c87e6b577f1c5a71fb5c39c3bd6125c4b91/packages/localize/tools/src/babel_core.ts\r\n* We cannot simply use the default import for e.g. `@babel/template` because the types are incorrect. This is a separate issue, but long-term it would be ideal to use the default import always, or have Babel ship an ESM distribution. The latter is in-progress, see

anyone using esbuild, you can add this plugin to allow both default and named imports in esm:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nconst babelDefaultImportPlugin = {\r\n  name: 'babel-default-import',\r\n  setup: build => {\r\n    build.onResolve({ filter: /^@babel\\/(traverse|generator)$/ }, args => {\r\n      return { path: args.path, namespace: 'babel-default-import' };\r\n    });\r\n\r\n    build.onLoad({ filter: /.*/, namespace: 'babel-default-import' }, args => {\r\n      return {\r\n        resolveDir: 'node_modules',\r\n        contents: `import module from '${args.path}/lib/index.js';\r\n          export default module.default ?? module;\r\n          export * from '${args.path}/lib/index.js';`,\r\n      };\r\n    });\r\n  },\r\n};\r\n\r\nesbuild.build({\r\n  // ...\r\n  plugins:

we don't maintain the .d.ts for @babel/generator\n\nBut it's not d.ts issue. I can place simple js file from cookbook:\n```javascript\nimport generate from \"@babel/generator\";\nimport parser from \"@babel/parser\";\n\nconst code = `function square(n) {\n  return n * n;\n}`;\n\nconst ast = parser.parse(code);\n\nconst output = generate(ast, {}, code);\nconsole.log(output);\n```\nRun `node test.mjs` and oops:\n```\nfile:///tmp/test.mjs:10\nconst output = generate(ast, {}, code);\n               ^\n\nTypeError: generate is not a function\n    at file:///Volumes/work/fingular/aha/test.mjs:10:16\n    at ModuleJob.run (node:internal/modules/esm/module_job:271:25)\n    at async onImport.tracePromise.__proto__ (node:internal/modules/esm/loader:547:26)\n    at async asyncRunEntryPointWithESMLoader (node:internal/modules/run_main:116:5)\n\nNode.js v22.12.0\n```\n\nMoreover, this usage is documented, as @Rounak-stha mentions in the [official docs](https://github.com/jamiebuilds/babel-handbook/blob/master/translations/en/plugin-handbook.md#visiting).\nSo it looks like a bug. Maybe it's a bug in node.js esm implementation... but it should be much easier to fix in one module than in node.js engine.\nWhy can't we fix it in babel 7? Why should the whole community have to deal with dirty hacks for another year or two until babel 8 can be adopted?\n\nIt seems to me that this can be fixed very easily... It's enough to add another named export, it can be done without breaking backwards compatibility.","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/babel/babel/issues/comments/2622854975/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"vovkasm","id":95272,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk1Mjcy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/95272?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vovkasm","html_url":"https://github.com/vovkasm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vovkasm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vovkasm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vovkasm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vovkasm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vovkasm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vovkasm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vovkasm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vovkasm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vovkasm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":16114459112,"node_id":"MEE_lADOAXbCs85ZFECFzwAAAAPAfyHo","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/babel/babel/issues/events/16114459112","actor":{"login":"Rounak-stha","id":66557682,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2NTU3Njgy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/66557682?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rounak-stha","html_url":"https://github.com/Rounak-stha","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rounak-stha/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rounak-stha/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rounak-stha/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rounak-stha/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rounak-stha/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rounak-stha/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rounak-stha/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rounak-stha/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rounak-stha/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2025-01-29T21:08:08Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":16114459127,"node_id":"SE_lADOAXbCs85ZFECFzwAAAAPAfyH3","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/babel/babel/issues/events/16114459127","actor":{"login":"Rounak-stha","id":66557682,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2NTU3Njgy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/66557682?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rounak-stha","html_url":"https://github.com/Rounak-stha","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rounak-stha/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rounak-stha/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rounak-stha/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rounak-stha/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rounak-stha/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rounak-stha/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rounak-stha/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rounak-stha/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Rounak-stha/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2025-01-29T21:08:08Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":16114928102,"node_id":"REFE_lADOAXbCs85ZFECFzwAAAAPAhknm","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/babel/babel/issues/events/16114928102","actor":{"login":"vovkasm","id":95272,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk1Mjcy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/95272?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vovkasm","html_url":"https://github.com/vovkasm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vovkasm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vovkasm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vovkasm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vovkasm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vovkasm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vovkasm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vovkasm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vovkasm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vovkasm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"0623ac20b3a8ea27b0a7863028271c6674d8b206","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vovkasm/babel/commits/0623ac20b3a8ea27b0a7863028271c6674d8b206","created_at":"2025-01-29T21:44:13Z","performed_via_github_ap
