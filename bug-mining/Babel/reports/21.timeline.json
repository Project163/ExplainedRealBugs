This means that the `isNodesEquivalent()` algorithm could potentially use this information to determine whether to compare the property values as AST nodes (i.e. recursively compare the values using `isNodesEquivalent()`) or as raw JS objects (i.e. compare the two objects via a shallow equality check).\r\n\r\n**Questions**\r\n\r\n- I'm not hugely familiar with the `babel-types` source – is `VISITOR_KEYS` definitely the correct source of truth to use here? i.e. I've assumed that any property that is *not* present in the `VISITOR_KEYS` array will *not* contain an AST node. Is this a valid assumption?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/babel/babel/issues/8165/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/babel/babel/issues/8165/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":1720194945,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MTcyMDE5NDk0NQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/babel/babel/issues/events/1720194945","actor":{"login":"hzoo","id":588473,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU4ODQ3Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/588473?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hzoo","html_url":"https://github.com/hzoo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hzoo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hzoo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hzoo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hzoo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hzoo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hzoo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hzoo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hzoo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hzoo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-07-06T12:45:25Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":1720195588,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDE3MjAxOTU1ODg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/babel/babel/issues/events/1720195588","actor":{"login":"hzoo","id":588473,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU4ODQ3Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/588473?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hzoo","html_url":"https://github.com/hzoo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hzoo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hzoo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hzoo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hzoo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hzoo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hzoo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hzoo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hzoo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hzoo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"e9184ed05e720601d96c2396536c9d99bf002433","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/babel/babel/commits/e9184ed05e720601d96c2396536c9d99bf002433","created_at":"2018-07-06T12:45:46Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":1887153439,"node_id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDE4ODcxNTM0Mzk=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/babel/babel/issues/events/1887153439","actor":{"login":"lock[bot]","id":33595554,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90MzM1OTU1NTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/6672?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lock%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/lock","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lock%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lock%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lock%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lock%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lock%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lock%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lock%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lock%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lock%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-10-05T13:29:12Z","label":{"name":"outdated","color":"ededed"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":1887153478,"node_id":"MDExOkxvY2tlZEV2ZW50MTg4NzE1MzQ3OA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/babel/babel/issues/events/1887153478","actor":{"login":"lock[bot]","id":33595554,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90MzM1OTU1NTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/6672?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lock%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/lock","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lock%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lock%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lock%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lock%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lock%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lock%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/loc
