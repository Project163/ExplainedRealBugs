Theoretically a loose approximation of this configuration would be a two-pass transformation: First transform with `transform-block-scoping` and then transform the intermediate result with `proposal-object-rest-spread`. The Babel REPL works good on two-pass transformation, which means there must be something wrong after the `block-scoping` transforms. Something that does not touch the syntax but the abstract metadata.\r\n\r\nThe error in #10339 comes from https://github.com/babel/babel/blob/eb3767d58b5e376fa4f4e95e1ba9dc86c667908d/packages/babel-plugin-proposal-object-rest-spread/src/index.js#L113-L116\r\nin the `removeUnusedExcludeKeys` function that is invoked only in `loose` mode. This routine will lookup the binding informations of the ObjectPattern `{ foo, ...bar }` in the for-of statements. For unknown reasons the binding informations are corrupted so exception is thrown.\r\n\r\nThe block-scoping transform will try to wrap the loop body into a closure once a let reference is used inside a function expressions in the loop body. Which means\r\n```js\r\nfor (const {foo, ...bar} of {}) {\r\n  () => foo;\r\n  bar;\r\n}\r\n```\r\nwill be transformed to\r\n```js\r\nvar _loop = function (foo, bar) {\r\n  () => foo;\r\n  bar;\r\n};\r\n\r\nfor (var { foo, ...bar } of qux) {\r\n  _loop(foo, bar);\r\n}\r\n```\r\nsince `foo` is inside an arrow function expression. However, the `block-scoping` transform incorrectly removes the binding after the loop body is wrapped -- maybe because we tend to feel it is useless since the whole loop body is wrapped in a new scope.\r\n\r\nThis operation creates dichotomy between the actual code and the abstract syntax tree: The variable declarator is still in our code while its binding information is removed. This error has been hidden for a while until it is luckily detected by `object-rest-spread` loose mode, which tries to manipulate the code according to the binding information.\r\n\r\nIn the end, the fix is pretty straightforward: do not remove the binding information and always synchronize code with AST.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/babel/babel/issues/10343/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/babel/babel/issues/10343/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":2696295083,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDI2OTYyOTUwODM=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/babel/babel/issues/events/2696295083","actor":{"login":"nicolo-ribaudo","id":7000710,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcwMDA3MTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7000710?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicolo-ribaudo","html_url":"https://github.com/nicolo-ribaudo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicolo-ribaudo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicolo-ribaudo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicolo-ribaudo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicolo-ribaudo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicolo-ribaudo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicolo-ribaudo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicolo-ribaudo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicolo-ribaudo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicolo-ribaudo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"40ba353594902e7fd7216a1b68e3bd2ea61b8ffa","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/JLHwung/babel/commits/40ba353594902e7fd7216a1b68e3bd2ea61b8ffa","created_at":"2019-10-08T17:42:34Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2696296898,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MjY5NjI5Njg5OA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/babel/babel/issues/events/2696296898","actor":{"login":"nicolo-ribaudo","id":7000710,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcwMDA3MTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7000710?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicolo-ribaudo","html_url":"https://github.com/nicolo-ribaudo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicolo-ribaudo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicolo-ribaudo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicolo-ribaudo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicolo-ribaudo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicolo-ribaudo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicolo-ribaudo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicolo-ribaudo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicolo-ribaudo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicolo-ribaudo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-10-08T17:43:13Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2696296956,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDI2OTYyOTY5NTY=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/babel/babel/issues/events/2696296956","actor":{"login":"nicolo-ribaudo","id":7000710,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcwMDA3MTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7000710?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicolo-ribaudo","html_url":"https://github.com/nicolo-ribaudo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicolo-ribaudo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicolo-ribaudo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicolo-ribaudo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicolo-ribaudo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicolo-ribaudo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicolo-ribaudo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicolo-ribaudo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicolo-ribaudo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicolo-ribaudo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"563874c06cb03708a235e6d1710c42fab6cf6018","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/babel/babel/commits/563874c06cb03708a235e6d1710c42fab6cf6018","created_at":"2019-10-08T17:43:15Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2928633187,"node_id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDI5Mjg2MzMxODc=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/babel/babel/issues/events/2928633187","actor":{"login":"lock[bot]","id":33595554,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90MzM1OTU1NTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/6672?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lock%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/lock","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lock%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lock%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}"
