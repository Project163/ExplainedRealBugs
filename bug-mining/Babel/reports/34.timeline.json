Current state:\r\n#### `@babel/runtime`\r\n- Added `@babel/runtime-corejs3` package and `corejs: 3` options to `@babel/plugin-transform-runtime`.\r\n- Added support of instance methods, fixes #8928.\r\n- Added flag `proposals` (in `corejs: { version: 3, proposals: true }` format) for support all proposals polyfills from `core-js`.\r\n- Used separate directories in runtime for `core-js` entry points with proposals and without.\r\n- Used `get-iterator-method` helper for getting iterators, fixes #2500.\r\n- As a cheap bonus, added support of IE8- (except some cases of `regenerator`).\r\n\r\n#### `@babel/polyfill`\r\n- Should be deprecated in favor of separate usage required features from `core-js` and `regenerator-runtime` with an informative message.\r\n\r\n#### `@babel/preset-env`\r\n- Uses for built-ins data from [`core-js-compat`](https://github.com/zloirock/core-js/tree/master/packages/core-js-compat) instead of `compat-table` since information from `compat-table` [is not enough](https://github.com/zloirock/core-js/pull/466).\r\n- `useBuilIns` now requires direct setting of `corejs` version option, without it will be used `2` by default and shown deprecation warning.\r\n- Added support of minor `core-js` versions for simplify updating in the future.\r\n- For preventing some order-related problems, polyfills in the both `core-js@3` plugins added on `post` stage in the order of `core-js-compat` data.\r\n- Divided plugins and polyfills parts of `preset-env`, instead of 2 internal plugins for adding polyfills, we have 6: usage and entry versions of plugins for `core-js@2`, `core-js@3`, `regenerator-runtime`.\r\n- Added support `samsung` target (for Samsung Internet) since `core-js-compat` and `compat-table` now contains mapping for this, fixes #6602.\r\n\r\n#### `useBuilIns: entry` with `corejs: 3`\r\n- No longer transforms `@babel/polyfill`.\r\n- Transforms **all possible** `core-js` entry points to import of related modules (based on data from [`core-js-compat`](https://unpkg.com/core-js-compat@3.0.0-beta.15/entries.json)).\r\n- Since of this, we no longer need `shippedProposals` / `proposals` flags with `useBuilIns: entry`.\r\n- Removes `regenerator-runtime/runtime` import where it's not required.\r\n\r\n#### `useBuilIns: usage` with `corejs: 3`\r\n- In addition to `shippedProposals`, added flag `proposals`  (in `corejs: { version: 3, proposals: true }` format) for polyfill all proposals from `core-js`.\r\n- Fixed list of dependencies in built-in definitions.\r\n- Improved the way of determination method / built-in name and source of this method.\r\n- Adds import of required polyfills on `MemberExpression`, `ObjectPattern`, `in` operator.\r\n- Adds import of required polyfills on access to global object properties.\r\n- Adds import of all required common iterators on all syntax features which use iterators protocol (`for-of`, destructuring, spread, `yield` delegation, etc.).\r\n- Adds import of promises on syntax features which use promises (async functions/generators, dynamic import, etc.), fixes #9250, #7402, etc.\r\n\r\n#### `core-js@2` stuff\r\nI didn't want to tough `core-js@2`-related stuff, however\r\n- Fixed some serious errors in definitions which breaks `Object.getOwnPropertySymbols`, `Symbol.toStringTag` logic, `Promise#finally`, `Array#forEach`, etc.\r\n- `Array#flatMap` and trim methods moved to stable features as a part of ES2019 and loaded by deprecated `@babel/polyfill` and `@babel/preset-env` with `corejs: 2` option.\r\n\r\n## 2018.12.30 Explanation of the current situation:\r\n\r\n#### `@babel/runtime`\r\n\r\nHere we have no serious problems.\r\n- Added `@babel/runtime-corejs3` package and `corejs: 3` options to `@babel/plugin-transform-runtime`.\r\n- Added support of instance methods.\r\n- Used `get-iterator-method` helper for getting iterators, fixes #2500.\r\n- As a cheap bonus, added support of IE8- (except some cases of `regenerator`).\r\n\r\n#### Breaking changes\r\n`@babel/runtime` can be updated without any problems by adding `@babel/runtime-corejs3` package. But not `@babel/polyfill` and `@babel/preset-env`.\r\n\r\nUpdating `@babel/polyfill` to `core-js@3` will break `@babel/preset-env`. `@babel/preset-env` with `useBuiltIns` transforms import of `@babel/polyfill` to import of required `core-js` modules. Most users don't add `core-js` dependency directly. In case of a minor update, even if `@babel/polyfill` dependency will be updated with `@babel/preset-env`, in the top level of `node_modules` we will have `core-js@2`, not `core-js@3` because a serious part of dependencies depends on packages with `core-js@2` in dependencies.\r\n\r\nUpdating `@babel/preset-env` will cause the same problem. More other, `@babel/preset-env` transforms also imports of `core-js`. If someone has `core-js@2` in dependencies, a minor update of `@babel/preset-env` will break it.\r\n\r\nBefore `babel@7` release, I proposed to deprecate `@babel/polyfill` in favor of separate inclusion of `core-js` and `regenerator-runtime`, but it was not done.\r\n\r\nSo,\r\n\r\nOptions for `@babel/polyfill`:\r\n- A major bump of `@babel/polyfill`.\r\n- Deprecation of `@babel/polyfill` package in favor recommendation of separate inclusion of required parts of `core-js` and `babel-runtime`.\r\n\r\nOptions for `@babel/preset-env`:\r\n- A major bump of `@babel/preset-env`.\r\n- Adding an option with a version of `core-js` like in `@babel/plugin-transform-runtime`. I'm not a fan of this way, because in this case, we will use a deprecated version of `core-js` by default, will cause spaghetti in configs and the code base and will cause problems for other mentioned here changes, at least, see `polyfilling of proposals` section.\r\n- Deprecation of `useBuiltIns` option of `@babel/preset-env` in favor of creation plugin(s) / preset in the scope of `core-js` for polyfills only.\r\n\r\n#### `@babel/preset-env`\r\nSome of the improvements already added, some should be added.\r\n- `compat-table` is not enough for correct detection of environments where `core-js` modules required. More info about it you could find [here](https://github.com/zloirock/core-js/pull/466). So I made [`core-js-compat`](https://github.com/zloirock/core-js/tree/master/packages/core-js-compat) package with required data which should be used here.\r\n- Built-ins definitions should be updated for include correct dependencies. Some parts of that were added before `babel@7` release, some still not.\r\n- All syntax features that work with iterators should add common iterators, async functions / generators should add `Promise` with dependencies (#9250), etc.\r\n\r\n#### Polyfilling of proposals\r\n\r\nIn the final `babel@7` versions, from all polyfilling-related stuff was removed polyfilling of proposals. Seems that it was a mistake.\r\n\r\nNew babel plugins for proposals **will** rely on new standard library features. And, with the current approach to polyfilling of proposals, it's too problematic.\r\n\r\nI can understand why polyfilling of proposals was removed from the default `@babel/polyfill`. But in this case, we should have added entry points which include proposals.\r\n\r\nAdding polyfills of proposals from `core-js` when the main part of polyfills loaded from `@babel/polyfill` is not a good solution because they could be loaded from another instance of `core-js` and it will cause problems.\r\n\r\nRemoving proposals from `runtime` will kill usage of new proposal plugins which depends on new standard library features with the `runtime`. They should be available in helpers. Even import of required part of `core-js` without global namespace pollution is rocket science for a serious part of developers. Also, `@babel/runtime-corejsx` is not `@babel/runtime-stable-corejsx-features`.\r\n\r\nThe same for `@babel/preset-env`, but not so critical.\r\n\r\n`@babel/preset-env` transforms `core-js` only to import of stable ES features. But the main `core-js` entry point also contains proposals and someone can expect some of them.\r\n\r\n`runtime` and `preset-env` inject polyfills based on feature detection, only when they are used, so I don't see any arguments why polyfilling of proposals was removed from those tools.\r\n\r\nThe `shippedProposals` option of `@babel/preset-env` looks like something strange. We haven't any equal in `core-js` entry points, so I don't see what should be transformed. Implementing in browser definitely is not an indicator that it should be polyfilled, but non-implemented proposals should not. I don't think that it's something that should be supported.\r\n\r\n\r\nSo, by my vision, the best approach is:\r\n- Deprecate `@babel/polyfill` in favor recommendation of separate inclusion of required parts of `core-js` and `babel-runtime`. If someone needs polyfills of proposals - he will use polyfills of proposals, not - not.\r\n- Deprecate transform of `@babel/polyfill` in `@babel/preset-env`.\r\n- Add to `preset-env` with `useBuiltIns: entry` (or a successor for polyfilling) transforms: `core-js` to all modules, `core-js/es`, `core-js/proposals` and `core-js/web` to related parts of `core-js`.\r\n- Allow `runtime` and `preset-env` inject proposals polyfills. Maybe - with an option for that, but option will make it harder.\r\n\r\n#### --------------------\r\n\r\nBefore the next step, we should decide what should we do with `@babel/polyfill`, `@babel/preset-env` breaking changes and polyfilling of proposals.
