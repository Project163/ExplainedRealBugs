for the bug report!\r\n\r\nThis is a parser bug, coming from the `nextToken` function of the tokenizer.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/babel/babel/blob/8f281f578db68ef2092ce35b8db003bdb346a9e4/packages/babel-parser/src/tokenizer/index.js#L223-L242\r\n\r\nAs you can see, in line 225 we handle the case where `curContext` is `undefined`, but we don't do it at line 236 when checking if `curContext.override` is defined. Since `curContext` might be `undefined`, this seems like a perfect use case for optional chaining. :wink: \r\n\r\nWould you like to open a PR?\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<!-- ALERT!!!!!!!\r\n    Before submitting this comment, please:\r\n      1. Write where to start searching the bug\r\n      2. Write where to add a new test\r\n    See https://github.com/babel/babel/issues/9563#issuecomment-466799807 for an example\r\n-->\r\n\r\nIf it is the first time that you contribute to Babel, follow these steps: (you need to have `make` and `yarn` available on your machine)\r\n1. **Write a comment there** to let other possible contributors know that you are working on this bug.\r\n1. Fork the repo\r\n1. Run `git clone https://github.com/<YOUR_USERNAME>/babel.git && cd babel`\r\n1. Run `yarn && make bootstrap`\r\n1. Wait :hourglass_flowing_sand: \r\n1. Run `make watch` (or `make build` whenever you change a file)\r\n1. Add a test at `packages/babel-parser/test/fixtures/es2020/optional-chaining` (only `input.js`; `output.json` will be automatically generated)\r\n1. Update the code!\r\n1. `yarn jest babel-parser` to run the tests\r\n    - If some test outputs don't match but the new results are correct, you can delete the bad `output.json` files and run the tests again\r\n    - If you prefer, you can run `OVERWRITE=true yarn jest babel-parser` and they will be automatically updated.\r\n1. If it is working, run `make test` to run all the tests\r\n1.

PR!","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/babel/babel/issues/comments/593963823/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"nicolo-ribaudo","id":7000710,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcwMDA3MTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7000710?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicolo-ribaudo","html_url":"https://github.com/nicolo-ribaudo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicolo-ribaudo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicolo-ribaudo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicolo-ribaudo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicolo-ribaudo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicolo-ribaudo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicolo-ribaudo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicolo-ribaudo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicolo-ribaudo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicolo-ribaudo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":3092267358,"node_id":"MDE0OlVubGFiZWxlZEV2ZW50MzA5MjI2NzM1OA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/babel/babel/issues/events/3092267358","actor":{"login":"nicolo-ribaudo","id":7000710,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcwMDA3MTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7000710?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicolo-ribaudo","html_url":"https://github.com/nicolo-ribaudo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicolo-ribaudo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicolo-ribaudo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicolo-ribaudo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicolo-ribaudo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicolo-ribaudo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicolo-ribaudo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicolo-ribaudo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicolo-ribaudo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicolo-ribaudo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"unlabeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-03-03T13:59:13Z","label":{"name":"i:
