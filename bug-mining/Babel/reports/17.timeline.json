shouldn't be getting `-Infinity`/`Infinity` or `NaN` since those just get stringified with the JS-standard stringification logic which means we get a reference to `NaN` or `Infinity` identifiers, which could have been shadowed in a local scope and thus not be the right value. I've avoided that by generating `NaN` as `0/0` and the infinity values as `1/0` and `-1/0`.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/babel/babel/issues/8005/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":1,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/babel/babel/issues/8005/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/babel/babel/issues/comments/391067958","html_url":"https://github.com/babel/babel/issues/8001#issuecomment-391067958","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/babel/babel/issues/8001","id":391067958,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM5MTA2Nzk1OA==","user":{"login":"loganfsmyth","id":132260,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMjI2MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/132260?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/loganfsmyth","html_url":"https://github.com/loganfsmyth","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/loganfsmyth/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/loganfsmyth/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/loganfsmyth/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/loganfsmyth/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/loganfsmyth/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/loganfsmyth/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/loganfsmyth/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/loganfsmyth/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/loganfsmyth/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-05-22T17:07:32Z","updated_at":"2018-05-22T17:07:32Z","body":"Alright,
