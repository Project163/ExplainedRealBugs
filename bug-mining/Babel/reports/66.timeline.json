Suggestion\r\n\r\n## 🔍 Search Terms\r\ndeclare module enum export import\r\n\r\n## ✅ Viability Checklist\r\n\r\nMy suggestion meets these guidelines:\r\n\r\n* [v] This wouldn't be a breaking change in existing TypeScript/JavaScript code\r\n* [v] This wouldn't change the runtime behavior of existing JavaScript code\r\n* [v] This could be implemented without emitting different JS based on the types of the expressions\r\n* [v] This isn't a runtime feature (e.g. library functionality, non-ECMAScript syntax with JavaScript output, new syntax sugar for JS, etc.)\r\n* [v] This feature would agree with the rest of [TypeScript's Design Goals](https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/wiki/TypeScript-Design-Goals).\r\n\r\n\r\n## ⭐ Suggestion\r\nAllow `export import` for types and values in `declare module`\r\n\r\n## 📃 Motivating Example\r\n```ts\r\ndeclare module './back_module' {\r\n    /** @deprecated for backward compatible */\r\n    export import EnumType = import('./front_module').EnumType; // Suggestion feature\r\n}\r\n(back_module as any).RawTypeId = front_module.RawTypeId;\r\n\r\n// ...\r\n\r\nimport { EnumType } from './back_module';\r\ntype foobar = EnumType.Value; // it's impossible with just `type =` and `let =`\r\ntype foobar2 = OnlyForEnumType<EnumType>; // it's impossible if enum is new\r\n```\r\n\r\n## 💻 Use Cases\r\n\r\nI moved `EnumType` to a different module but I wish to keep it backward compatible.\r\nand `back_module` cannot import `front_module` for my situation.\r\nSo I want to declare it on the other module which combines them.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/TypeScript/issues/43159/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/TypeScript/issues/43159/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":5559430607,"node_id":"LE_lADOAXbCs84sJVAOzwAAAAFLXi3P","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/babel/babel/issues/events/5559430607","actor":{"login":"github-actions[bot]","id":41898282,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90NDE4OTgyODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/15368?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/github-actions","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-11-03T04:03:26Z","label":{"name":"outdated","color":"ededed"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":5559430636,"node_id":"LOE_lADOAXbCs84sJVAOzwAAAAFLXi3s","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/babel/babel/issues/events/5559430636","actor":{"login":"github-actions[bot]","id":41898282,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90NDE4OTgyODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/15368?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/github-actions","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"locked","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-11-03T04:03:26Z","lock_reason":"resolved","performed_via_github_app":null}]
