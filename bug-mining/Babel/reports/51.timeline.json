you attempt to load the `webextension-polyfill` as a module, you get a runtime failure in both Chrome and Firefox due to the utilization of `this` as the `global` parameter.  `this` is undefined in the context of an ES module, so when the root UMD module function is called and `this` is passed to the `global` parameter, it ends up passing `undefined`.  Then when `global.browser` is referenced you get a type error.\r\n\r\nThe same problem occurs with the minified source.\r\n\r\nError message in Firefox:\r\n```\r\nTypeError: global is undefined\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Recommendation\r\nUse `globalThis || window || this` instead of `this` as the first parameter.

you want to request a *feature* or report a *bug*?**\r\nBug-ish.\r\n\r\n**What is the current behavior?**\r\n`import 'react'` (where 'react' is the UMD module build) from an ES module will fail due to https://github.com/rollup/rollup/pull/2274.  `this` is not set in the context of ES modules, so if you try to `import 'react'` in that context you will get a runtime error since `this` is undefined and Rollup (before the linked fix) tries to use `this` when it really means `globalThis` or `self`.\r\n\r\n**If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce and if possible a minimal demo of the problem. Your bug will get fixed much faster if we can run your code and it doesn't have dependencies other than React. Paste the link to your JSFiddle (https://jsfiddle.net/Luktwrdm/) or CodeSandbox (https://codesandbox.io/s/new) example below:**\r\n```\r\nnpm install react\r\n```\r\n`index.html`\r\n```html\r\n<!DOCTYPE html>\r\n<head><meta charset='utf-8'></head>\r\n<body>\r\n\t<script type='module'>\r\n\t\timport './node_modules/react/umd/react.development.js'\r\n\t</script>\r\n</body>\r\n```\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\nThe React UMD module can be loaded by an ES module.\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue?
