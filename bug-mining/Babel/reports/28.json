Is this something babel can do? There is already this issue which is kinda similar https://github.com/babel/babel/issues/8019 but also this one which emphasis on the fact that `_this` should user the value resturned by `super()` #2279\r\n\r\n**Environment**\r\n- Babel version(s): v7.1.5\r\n- Node/npm version: Node 8/npm 6\r\n- OS: build Ubuntu 18.04, this test on Windows 10 / Edge 17\r\n- Monorepo no\r\n- How you are using Babel: loader\r\n\r\n**Possible Solution**\r\n\r\nAnother possible solution would be to not transpile on rest/spread & default argument function when `targets: {esmodules: true}` or `targets: {browsers: 'Edge >= 14'}` because its seems they support it\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"nicolo-ribaudo","id":7000710,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcwMDA3MTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7000710?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicolo-ribaudo","html_url":"https://github.com/nicolo-ribaudo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicolo-ribaudo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicolo-ribaudo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicolo-ribaudo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicolo-ribaudo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicolo-ribaudo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicolo-ribaudo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicolo-ribaudo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicolo-ribaudo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicolo-ribaudo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/babel/babel/issues/9020/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/babel/babel/issues/9020/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
