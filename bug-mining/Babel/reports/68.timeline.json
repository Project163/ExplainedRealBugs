@The-x-Theorist If it is the first time you contribute to Babel, see Nicolò's comment above on setting up the project.\r\n> \r\n> This issue is on babel parser. If you are not familiar with the topic, which is absolutely okay, you can start by trying out https://astexplorer.net/ (Select JavaScript then `@babel/parser`) or reading tutorials about parsing and AST.\r\n> \r\n> If you already had some experience on developing a parser, you can start by\r\n> \r\n> https://github.com/babel/babel/blob/fb7ddf4d389d3c9eff52567080f54995ba182031/packages/babel-parser/src/parser/expression.js#L2304\r\n> \r\n> and scrutinize how `ExpressionScope` is handled when Babel is parsing arrow expression -- because the OP's error is thrown when [an ExpressionScope is validated](https://github.com/babel/babel/blob/fb7ddf4d389d3c9eff52567080f54995ba182031/packages/babel-parser/src/util/expression-scope.js#L194). For the definition of Expression Scope, see [here](https://github.com/babel/babel/blob/main/packages/babel-parser/src/util/expression-scope.js#L9).\r\n> For more questions, you can ask team members on Slack.\r\n\r\nError is recorded when await expression is parsed.\r\nInside `parseAwait()`\r\n`this.expressionScope.recordParameterInitializerError(\r\n      node.start,\r\n      Errors.AwaitExpressionFormalParameter,\r\n    );`\r\n\r\nBut how it can be avoided to not record the error for this

But how it can be avoided to not record the error for this scenario.\r\n\r\nGood question! Note that the recorded error may not throw, it is eagerly recorded in case we need to throw later. For example,\r\n\r\n```js\r\nasync () => {\r\n  async ({ [await x]: 1 }); // valid\r\n  async ({ [await x]: 1 }) => {}; // invalid\r\n}\r\n```\r\nBabel will create an `AsyncArrowScope` for `async (...`, we need to record the `await` error but we can't throw the error until we see an `=>` after `async( ... )`, otherwise we just discard the recorded errors.\r\n\r\nNow let's head back to OP's example, I will mark the expected expression scope changes in comments.\r\n\r\n```js\r\n(async function \r\n// enter ParameterDeclarationScope\r\n(\r\n// exit ParameterDeclarationScope\r\n) \r\n// enter ExpressionScope E1\r\n{\r\n  function f\r\n// enter ParameterDeclarationScope\r\n(\r\n_=\r\n// enter ArrowHeadScope\r\n(\r\n// exit ArrowHeadScope\r\n)=>\r\n// enter ExpressionScope E2\r\nnull\r\n// exit ExpressionScope E2\r\n// exit ParameterDeclarationScope\r\n) \r\n// enter ExpressionScope E3\r\n{\r\n// exit ExpressionScope E3\r\n}\r\n  await null;\r\n// exit ExpressionScope E1\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote that if it works as expected, we should never throw the error for `await null` because it is in the ExpressionScope (E1). I suspect the bug is related to how we parse the arrow expression, specifically we should check if the scope is entered / exited as expected.","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/babel/babel/issues/comments/959166534/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"JLHwung","id":3607926,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2MDc5MjY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3607926?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JLHwung","html_url":"https://github.com/JLHwung","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JLHwung/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JLHwung/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JLHwung/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JLHwung/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JLHwung/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JLHwung/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JLHwung/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JLHwung/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JLHwung/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}}]
