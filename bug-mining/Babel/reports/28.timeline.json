I'm not sure if this issue was better suited at terser-js or an edge issue tracker - posting it here as i faced it on meteor.\r\n\r\nWe've a react component which helps us caching method results(stripped out the interesting parts):\r\n```js\r\nexport class MethodQuery extends React.Component {\r\n  state = {\r\n    loading: true,\r\n    data: null,\r\n    error: null\r\n  };\r\n\r\n  fetch = async (forceFetch = false, isNameChanged = false) => {\r\n    const { methodName: name, params, cacheDuration } = this.props;\r\n    const resetState = { loading: true };\r\n    if (isNameChanged) resetState.data = null;\r\n    this.setState(resetState);\r\n    try {\r\n      const data = await methodCached.call({ name, params, cacheDuration, forceFetch });\r\n      this.setState({ loading: false, data });\r\n    } catch (error) {\r\n      this.setState({ error, loading: false });\r\n    }\r\n  };\r\n}\r\n```\r\nwhich produces:\r\n```js\r\nclass MethodQuery extends React.Component {\r\n  constructor() {\r\n    var _this;\r\n\r\n    _this = super(...arguments);\r\n    this.state = {\r\n      loading: true,\r\n      data: null,\r\n      error: null\r\n

being defined inside fetch - on chrome it works.\r\n\r\nWith the following diff\r\n\r\n```js\r\n- fetch = async (forceFetch = false, isNameChanged = false) => {\r\n+ fetch = async (forceFetch, isNameChanged) => {\r\n```\r\n\r\na slightly different code is generated which works on ieEdge\r\n\r\n```js\r\nclass MethodQuery extends React.Component {\r\n  constructor() {\r\n
