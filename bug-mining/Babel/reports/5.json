String literals are literal types and need a value. In code this would look like this:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nconst literal: 'literal' = 'literal';\r\n\r\n// This is different from StringTypeAnnotation which needs no args:\r\nconst literal: string = 'literal';\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis should create a node of this shape:\r\n\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n  \"type\": \"StringLiteralTypeAnnotation\",\r\n  \"start\": 15,\r\n  \"end\": 24,\r\n  \"loc\": null,\r\n  \"extra\": {\r\n    \"rawValue\": \"literal\",\r\n    \"raw\": \"'literal'\"\r\n  },\r\n  \"value\": \"literal\"\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Current Behavior\r\nException is thrown:\r\n```\r\nStringLiteralTypeAnnotation: Too many arguments passed. Received 1 but can receive no more than 0\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Possible Solution\r\n\r\nI have no idea what I am doing but when I add the visitor `\"value\"` to the definition in `packages/babel-types/src/definitions/flow.js` it works as expected. Maybe I can prepare a PR but I really don't know if this is the actual fix. There are some more types that have the same mismatch of fields and visitors.\r\n\r\n```diff\r\n defineType(\"StringLiteralTypeAnnotation\", {\r\n+  visitor: [\"value\"],\r\n   aliases: [\"Flow\", \"FlowType\"],\r\n   fields: {\r\n     value: validate(assertValueType(\"string\")),\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Context\r\n\r\nI am building a type generator to create Flow type definitions for GraphQL queries. I use `@babel/types` to build ASTs and then `@babel/generator` to create the code. This is working so well so far, awesome work on babel 7. I absolutely love it ❤️ \r\n\r\n### Your Environment\r\n\r\n| software         | version(s)\r\n| ---------------- | -------\r\n| Babel            | @babel/types@7.0.0-beta.44\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"hzoo","id":588473,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU4ODQ3Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/588473?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hzoo","html_url":"https://github.com/hzoo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hzoo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hzoo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hzoo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hzoo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hzoo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hzoo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hzoo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hzoo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hzoo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/babel/babel/issues/7697/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/babel/babel/issues/7697/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
