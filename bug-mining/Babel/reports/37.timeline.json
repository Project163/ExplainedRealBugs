https://github.com/babel/website/pull/2038\r\n| Any Dependency Changes?  |\r\n| License                  | MIT\r\n\r\nThis adds *basic* namespace support for TypeScript in babel. Currently, it's an outright error, so this only adds new functionality where a project would otherwise outright fail to run through babel. I recommend adding some type of *feature gate* for this functionality, until it has been used at-large for some period of time.\r\n\r\nThe implementation may be best explained by comparing the [canonical example](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/namespaces.html) that is added as a [test case](https://github.com/babel/babel/tree/28882ced08374d794b36901893853d821d606630/packages/babel-plugin-transform-typescript/test/fixtures/namespace/canonical) (*[in](https://github.com/babel/babel/blob/28882ced08374d794b36901893853d821d606630/packages/babel-plugin-transform-typescript/test/fixtures/namespace/canonical/input.mjs) [out](https://github.com/babel/babel/blob/28882ced08374d794b36901893853d821d606630/packages/babel-plugin-transform-typescript/test/fixtures/namespace/canonical/output.mjs)*).\r\n\r\nThree known limitations (ordered by increasing complexity of respective solution):\r\n\r\n* ~Sharing the name of the directly enclosing namespace. This requires using a unique identifier as the parameter, which subsequently limits how a project using babel can interact with their namespaces. Making a dynamic solution, one that uses a unique identifier only when necessary, requires a similar solution to the next item. *There is test coverage for this.*~\r\n\r\n* Exporting mutable members from inside a namespace. This requires a much more comprehensive depth-first visitor that does extensive scope checking, or an independent state machine to track transformed namespace nodes. *There is test coverage for this.*\r\n\r\n* Scope sharing. In image form: ![Scope Sharing](https://images-ext-1.discordapp.net/external/7ogd5EHjOliyTaK12VDrCEbkxVWJJMmYzo8Gh4taLfE/https/media.discordapp.net/attachments/499684844905693184/558651767018094621/unknown.png) [Link](https://www.typescriptlang.org/play/index.html#src=class%20A%20%7B%20%7D%0D%0Anamespace%20A%20%7B%0D%0A%20%20export%20const%20B%20%3D%201%3B%0D%0A%7D%0D%0Anamespace%20A%20%7B%0D%0A%20%20function%20doThing()%20%7B%0D%0A%20%20%20%20console.log(B)%3B%0D%0A%20%20%7D%0D%0A%7D%0D%0A). This would require a greater complexity than the mutable member limitation. In addition, a fully correct version requires having a full type-model spanning every file, effectively **impossible** using babel's model.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/babel/babel/issues/9785/reactions","total_count":30,"+1":17,"-1":0,"laugh":2,"hooray":4,"confused":0,"heart":7,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/babel/babel/issues/9785/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":2373081276,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDIzNzMwODEyNzY=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/babel/babel/issues/events/2373081276","actor":{"login":"Wolvereness","id":983111,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk4MzExMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/983111?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Wolvereness","html_url":"https://github.com/Wolvereness","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Wolvereness/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Wolvereness/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Wolvereness/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Wolvereness/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Wolvereness/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Wolvereness/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Wolvereness/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Wolvereness/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Wolvereness/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"f667e63a879befdb4816bde4c1689df03f60f582","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/VelocityMSC/babel/commits/f667e63a879befdb4816bde4c1689df03f60f582","created_at":"2019-05-28T20:43:00Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"actor":{"login":"Wolvereness","id":983111,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk4MzExMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/983111?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Wolvereness","html_url":"https://github.com/Wolvereness","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Wolvereness/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Wolvereness/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Wolvereness/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Wolvereness/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Wolvereness/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Wolvereness/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Wolvereness/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Wolvereness/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Wolvereness/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-05-28T20:49:37Z","updated_at":"2019-05-28T20:49:37Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/babel/babel/issues/10034","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/babel/babel","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/babel/babel/issues/10034/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/babel/babel/issues/10034/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/babel/babel/issues/10034/events","html_url":"https://github.com/babel/babel/pull/10034","id":449470793,"node_id":"MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0MjgyOTkxNzE2","number":10034,"title":"Use
