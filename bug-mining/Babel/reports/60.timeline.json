Bug Report\r\n\r\n- [X] I would like to work on a fix!\r\n\r\n**Current behavior**\r\n\r\n`@babel/register` with `ignore: []` option does not transform various modules which Babel uses internally.\r\n\r\n**Input Code**\r\n\r\n```js\r\n// Plugin to add '/* transformed */' comment to start of function bodies\r\nconst plugin = () => ( {\r\n  visitor: {\r\n    Function(path) {\r\n      const bodyNode = path.node.body;\r\n      (bodyNode.leadingComments || (bodyNode.leadingComments = [])).push( {\r\n        type: 'CommentBlock',\r\n        value: ' transformed '\r\n      } );\r\n    },\r\n  },\r\n} );\r\n\r\nrequire('@babel/register')( {\r\n  ignore: [],\r\n  plugins: [plugin]\r\n} );\r\n\r\nconsole.log( require('lodash/last').toString() );\r\nconsole.log( require('lodash/isPlainObject').toString() );\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\n\r\nThe body of the function exported by `lodash/last` contains the `/* transformed */` comment as expected - it has been transformed.\r\n\r\n`lodash/isPlainObject`, however, does not contain `/* transformed */` - it has failed to be transformed.\r\n\r\nBoth modules should be transformed.\r\n\r\nThe difference between the two is that Babel's internal code includes `require('lodash/isPlainObject')`. This `require()` is lazily-executed during the transform of code. Therefore, Babel skips transforming it at [this line](https://github.com/babel/babel/blob/10978bb65a4b4e8874ca8dd3054b8c31b5838b7f/packages/babel-register/src/node.js#L87).\r\n\r\nSame problem as https://github.com/babel/babel/issues/11964.\r\n\r\n**Babel Configuration (babel.config.js, .babelrc, package.json#babel, cli command, .eslintrc)**\r\n\r\nNone.\r\n\r\n**Environment**\r\n\r\n- Babel version(s): 7.12.0\r\n- Node/npm version: Node 14.12.0 / npm 6.14.8\r\n- OS: macOS 10.14.6\r\n- Monorepo: no\r\n- How you are using Babel: `babel-register`\r\n\r\n**Possible Solution**\r\n\r\n`@babel/register` could maintain a separate module cache for modules `require()`-ed internally. This would ensure that lazy `require()`s within Babel operate as intended, but do not prevent the modules also being transformed as far as the external caller is concerned.\r\n\r\nI will submit a PR for this in next few days.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/babel/babel/issues/12662/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/babel/babel/issues/12662/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/babel/babel/issues/comments/763276992","html_url":"https://github.com/babel/babel/issues/11964#issuecomment-763276992","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/babel/babel/issues/11964","id":763276992,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc2MzI3Njk5Mg==","user":{"login":"overlookmotel","id":557937,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1NzkzNw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/557937?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/overlookmotel","html_url":"https://github.com/overlookmotel","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/overlookmotel/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/overlookmotel/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/overlookmotel/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/overlookmotel/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/overlookmotel/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/overlookmotel/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/overlookmotel/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/overlookmotel/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/overlookmotel/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-01-20T02:06:28Z","updated_at":"2021-01-20T02:06:28Z","body":"Issue

MIT\r\n\r\nAs discussed in issues #11964 and #12662, babel-register fails to transform modules which Babel uses internally. In a few cases (e.g. `require('to-fast-properties')`), this can cause babel-register to throw an error.\r\n\r\nThese issues arise when babel-register is called with `ignore: []` option so it transforms the contents of `node_modules`.\r\n\r\nThere are two reasons why modules don't get transformed:\r\n\r\n1. The modules are `require()`-ed within babel-register before the pirates hook is activated.\r\n2. The modules are lazily-required during transform, and register [bails out of transforming them](https://github.com/babel/babel/blob/10978bb65a4b4e8874ca8dd3054b8c31b5838b7f/packages/babel-register/src/node.js#L87) to prevent an infinite loop.\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes both problems.\r\n\r\nPrior to loading `lib/node.js`, it creates a mock module cache. All `require()` calls within babel register use this internal module cache, so untransformed modules are not populated in the global (normal) module cache. When these modules are loaded externally, they pass through register's transform.\r\n\r\nUsually, messing around with Node's module cache would be considered pretty hacky, but in the context of babel-register, it seems more reasonable to me.\r\n\r\nThere is a special case for `source-map-support` package which is shared between both the global module cache and register's internal module cache. This is necessary as the module is stateful. It would be ideal to transform this module too, but the workaround necessary to do so is pretty tortuous, so I've omitted it from this PR.\n\n<a
