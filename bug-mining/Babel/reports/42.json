When the statement before the comment does not have a semi-colon, the comment is treated as a trailing comment instead of a leading comment for the next statement.\r\n\r\n**Input Code**\r\n- REPL or Repo link if applicable:\r\n\r\n```js\r\n    const files = glob.sync(`examples/**/*.{js,jsx}`);\r\n\r\n    files.forEach(f => {\r\n      const contents = fs.readFileSync(f).toString()\r\n      const parsed = parser.parse(contents, {\r\n        estree: true,\r\n        sourceType: 'module',\r\n        plugins: ['jsx', 'classProperties']\r\n      })\r\n      this.log(JSON.stringify(parsed, null, 2))\r\n    })\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you place the following code in examples/test.jsx and try to run this code on it, you should find comments attached the the preceeding nodes. Adding semi-colons changes the behavior to the expected behavior:\r\n\r\n```js\r\n/**\r\n * Another class component\r\n */\r\nexport class AnotherClassComponent extends Component {\r\n  render() {\r\n    return <span>{value}</span>\r\n  }\r\n}\r\nAnotherClassComponent.propTypes = {\r\n  value: PropTypes.string.isRequired\r\n}\r\n\r\n/**\r\n * This is the default export\r\n */\r\nexport default A = () => <span>DEFAULT!</span>\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior/code**\r\nThe above code should work with or without semi-colons preceding the comment. In fact, as far as I can tell, [this](https://astexplorer.net/#/gist/43f7b973af384e6a2e3f0756d9294a0c/d7484b23f79555af721c89c7500c5f29878516f2) AST explorer works as expected with babylon7, which I am assuming should be the same as `@babel/parser` (although that may be an incorrect assumption on my part).\r\n\r\n**Babel Configuration (.babelrc, package.json, cli command)**\r\nN/A. I'm using `@babel/parser` directly, and do not have a .babelrc.\r\n\r\n**Environment**\r\n- Babel version(s): 7.5.0\r\n- Node/npm version: Node 10/npm 6\r\n- OS: Manjaro Linux\r\n- Monorepo: no\r\n- How you are using Babel: `@babel/parser`\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"existentialism","id":56288,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2Mjg4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/56288?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/existentialism","html_url":"https://github.com/existentialism","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/existentialism/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/existentialism/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/existentialism/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/existentialism/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/existentialism/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/existentialism/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/existentialism/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/existentialism/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/existentialism/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/babel/babel/issues/10230/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/babel/babel/issues/10230/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
