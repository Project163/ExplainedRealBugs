It's just that export default specifically implies an evaluation of its right side, while other export forms don't.\r\n\r\n(I apologize in advance for my terrible habit of replying with far too much detail. It's hard to break!)\r\n\r\nNot quite sure what this is saying, since in JS declarations are evaluated, but I'm going to assume you mean it implies an expression? Otherwise you are excluding all type exports :)\r\n\r\nFrom my understanding, essentially there are four kinds of export in plain JS:\r\n\r\n```js\r\n// 1. export name list\r\nconst foo = 123, bar = \"abc\";\r\nexport { foo, bar as baz };\r\n\r\n// 2. export declaration\r\nexport function f() {}\r\nexport class C {}\r\nexport const x = 123;\r\n// equivalent to\r\nfunction f() {}\r\nclass C {}\r\nconst x = 123;\r\nexport { f, C, x };\r\n\r\n// 3. export default expression\r\nexport default 123;\r\n// equivalent to\r\nconst _new_name = 123;\r\nexport { _new_name as default };\r\n\r\n// 4. export default declaration\r\nexport default function g() {}\r\n// or\r\nexport default class D() {}\r\n// equivalent to\r\nfunction g() {}\r\nexport { g as default };\r\n// or\r\nclass D() {}\r\nexport { D as default };\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote that 2, 3 and 4 are all equivalent to 1.\r\n\r\nTypescript originally added:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\n// 5. export type names in name lists\r\ntype T = number;\r\ninterface U { x: number; }\r\nexport { T, U as V }\r\n\r\n// 6. export type declarations\r\nexport type W = number;\r\nexport interface X { x: number };\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo 5 is the type version of 1, making type and value names comparable, and 6 is the type version of 2, making type and value declarations comparable. A type version of 3 runs into syntax issues:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\n// 7. can't export type expression\r\nexport default { x: number }; // oops, this is a value\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut a type version of 4 is pretty straightforward, and is more surprising for being missing than not:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\n// 8. export default type declaration\r\nexport default interface Y { x: number };\r\n// equivalent to:\r\ninterface Y { x: number };\r\nexport { Y as default };\r\n```\r\n\r\n(only this supported at the moment, other forms, such as `export default type T = ...;` [look to be on track](https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/issues/3792#issuecomment-303526468))\r\n\r\nIf you are still unconvinced, for a motivating case, consider a standard practice of naming your files after their default export:\r\n\r\n```js\r\n// Storage.js\r\nexport default class Storage { ... }\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow say you split this into two implementations:\r\n\r\n```js\r\n// LocalStorage.js\r\nimport Storage from \"./Storage\";\r\nexport default class LocalStorage extends Storage { ... }\r\n// RemoteStorage.js\r\nimport Storage from \"./Storage\";\r\nexport default class RemoteStorage extends Storage { ... }\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow you heard that types are what's cool right now so you rename all your files from .js to .ts. Later you realize that you don't need a `Storage` *class*, an interface would do fine. Naively:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\n// Storage.ts\r\nexport default interface Storage {}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWithout `export default interface`, the alternatives are confusing, misleading or just ugly!","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/babel/babel/issues/comments/356818276/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"simonbuchan","id":1840547,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NDA1NDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1840547?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/simonbuchan","html_url":"https://github.com/simonbuchan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/simonbuchan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/simonbuchan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/simonbuchan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/simonbuchan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/simonbuchan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/simonbuchan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/simonbuchan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/simonbuchan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/simonbuchan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/babel/babel/issues/comments/356819775","html_url":"https://github.com/babel/babel/issues/7118#issuecomment-356819775","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/babel/babel/issues/7118","id":356819775,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM1NjgxOTc3NQ==","user":{"login":"Jessidhia","id":73085,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjczMDg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/73085?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jessidhia","html_url":"https://github.com/Jessidhia","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jessidhia/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jessidhia/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jessidhia/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jessidhia/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jessidhia/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jessidhia/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jessidhia/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jessidhia/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jessidhia/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-01-11T04:14:14Z","updated_at":"2018-01-11T04:15:40Z","body":"Exactly, `export default` implies an expression _except_ on the specific exceptions added for `HoistableDeclaration` and `ClassDeclaration`.

This is strange logic, expressions and declarations behave completely differently! It is slightly unfortunate that `function foo() {}` and `class Foo {}` are either expressions or declarations (with the resultant differences in semantics) depending on location, but it's hardly the worst language ambiguity in JS.\r\n\r\nSurely it's clearer to say \"export default allows either expressions or (some) declarations\"? Where the excluded declarations in JS are, to my knowledge, only `var`/`let`/`const`, which are excluded because they can introduce multiple names, and it's not worth introducing another form just for export default. That is, it has two syntactic and semantic forms, which I've labeled 3 and 4 above.\r\n\r\nBy this interpretation, Typescript already had a type equivalent to forms 1 and 2, (forms 5 and 6) and they are adding the missing type equivalent to form 4, form 8.\r\n\r\nIn other words, I'm claiming that JS specs `Hoistable` and `ClassDeclaration` essentially as \"all declarations except variables, cause we don't care about fixing it for `export default var a, b`\", so when typescript adds a bunch of other declarations they naturally should be included.\r\n\r\n(Incidentally, I'm not sure about `export default function () {}` - `function () {}` is an expression and not a declaration, clearly, and it behaves essentially the same in form 3 barring the function name. It could simply be getting that as a side-effect of transpilation, but if it's explicitly spec-ed as exporting a function named `default`, then you could simply treat it as another special syntax form and semantics for export default if it bothers you)\r\n\r\nSorry if I'm getting repetitive!","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/babel/babel/issues/comments/356844206/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"simonbuchan","id":1840547,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NDA1NDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1840547?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/simonbuchan","html_url":"https://github.com/simonbuchan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/simonbuchan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/simonbuchan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/simonbuchan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/simonbuchan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/simonbuchan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/simonbuchan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/simonbuchan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/simonbuchan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/simonbuchan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/babel/babel/issues/comments/356848310","html_url":"https://github.com/babel/babel/issues/7118#issuecomment-356848310","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/babel/babel/issues/7118","id":356848310,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM1Njg0ODMxMA==","user":{"login":"Jessidhia","id":73085,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjczMDg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/73085?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jessidhia","html_url":"https://github.com/Jessidhia","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jessidhia/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jessidhia/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jessidhia/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jessidhia/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jessidhia/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jessidhia/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jessidhia/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jessidhia/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jessidhia/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-01-11T07:24:26Z","updated_at":"2018-01-11T07:29:51Z","body":"`export default` _only_ allows AssignmentExpressions (rvalue expressions) except for things that fall under the lookahead `[lookahead ∉ { function, async [no LineTerminator here] function, class }]`, which is there specifically to allow `export default HoistableDeclaration` and `export default ClassDeclaration` to match unambiguously. https://tc39.github.io/ecma262/#prod-ExportDeclaration\r\n\r\nIt's only `export` that allows arbitrary `Declaration`s (and `VariableStatement`).\r\n\r\nThis is by far what people confuse the most about `export default`, because `export default` is very special. `export default` is not an export named default, `export default` is not the default export, `export default` is an expression evaluation that is assigned to a concrete value named `*default*`, and it is _that_ value that is exported as the export named `default`.

bug, tell us what your babel configuration looks like -->\r\n\r\n```js\r\n{\r\n  \"presets\": [\r\n    [\"@babel/env\", {\r\n      \"targets\": {\r\n        \"browsers\": [\"last 2 versions\"],\r\n

]\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Expected Behavior\r\n\r\nEither:\r\n* Not referencing (thus exporting) IEvent at all\r\n* Or, setting IEvent to undefined/null/anything so parsing the file doesn't result in a runtime error\r\n\r\n### Current Behavior\r\n\r\nTS compilation results in:\r\n\r\n```js\r\n\"use strict\";\r\n\r\nexports.__esModule = true;\r\nexports.default = void 0;\r\nvar _default = IEvent; // <<< IEvent doesn't exist!\r\nexports.default = _default;\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhich results in the runtime error:\r\n```js\r\nUncaught ReferenceError: IEvent is not defined\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Possible Solution\r\nWhen stripping interfaces (or probably any non-value types), either:\r\n* leave a placeholder value for exports\r\n* or, detect references in exports and remove those exports\r\n\r\n### Context\r\nI'm using and re-exporting interfaces in my node modules' 'index.ts' file, so you can use them in other TypeScript projects, e.g.:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\n// index.ts\r\nimport { default as IEvent } from \"./lib/IEvent\";\r\n\r\n// app.ts\r\nimport { IEvent } from \"seng-event\";\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen publishing the package, the `tsc` also runs to generate `d.ts` files, which makes the code above work in a TS project (babel strips types and generates JS code, tsc generates the definitions).\r\n\r\n**Workaround**\r\nA workaround is to use named exports, since the faulty generated code only happens when using default exports.\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nexport interface IEvent {\r\n  type: string;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen using a named export, the export itself will be removed along with the interface, since it's a single statement. The (now empty) file will be imported somewhere, but will just result in an undefined value. This shouldn't matter, since Interfaces themselves are not used at runtime.\r\n\r\n### Your Environment\r\n\r\n| software         | version(s)\r\n| ---------------- | -------\r\n| Babel            |  7.0.0-beta.42\r\n| node             | 8.9.1\r\n| npm              | 5.5.1\r\n| Operating System | macOS 10.13.3\r\n\r\n### Related\r\n\r\nDifferent but related to https://github.com/babel/babel/issues/7118 (where that's a syntax/parsing error, while this current issue is a runtime error)\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nEdit by @nicolo-ribaudo\r\n\r\nThis also doesn't work
