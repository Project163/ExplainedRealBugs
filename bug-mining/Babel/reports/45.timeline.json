a `filename` option and it should work\r\n```js\r\nBabel.transform(code, { filename: 'example.ts', presets: ['typescript'] });\r\n```\r\n\r\n`@babel/preset-typescript` uses `filename` to test if it is a TypeScript file and then it will apply `plugin-transform-typescript` by cases.\r\n```js\r\n{\r\n  test: /\\.ts$/,\r\n  plugins: [[transformTypeScript, { jsxPragma }]],\r\n}\r\n```\r\nPer [`filename` options document](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/options#filename), although `filename` is optional, options like `test` rely on `filename` to match test rules. In your case, since the `filename` is not passed but the config builder has to test `/\\.ts$/`, it bails out because it could not determine if it is a `.ts` file.\r\n\r\nIf the `filename` option seems artificial here as I guess you are transforming a code snippet instead of a file, you can also pass `allExtensions: true` to the [typescript preset options](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/babel-preset-typescript#allextensions). It will assume your code is `.tsx` and apply typescript transforms _and_ JSX transforms.\r\n\r\n```js\r\nBabel.transform(code, { presets: [['typescript', { allExtensions: true }]] })\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n@nicolo-ribaudo Although the behavior is expected, I think if we can have better documents [here](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/babel-standalone#usage). For those presets, i.e. preset-typescript, using pattern match options, we could post a reminder to declare artificial `filename` option in transform API.","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/babel/babel/issues/comments/507675572/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"JLHwung","id":3607926,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2MDc5MjY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3607926?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JLHwung","html_url":"https://github.com/JLHwung","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JLHwung/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JLHwung/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JLHwung/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JLHwung/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JLHwung/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JLHwung/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JLHwung/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JLHwung/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JLHwung/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":2454367298,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MjQ1NDM2NzI5OA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/babel/babel/issues/events/2454367298","actor":{"login":"nicolo-ribaudo","id":7000710,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcwMDA3MTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7000710?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicolo-ribaudo","html_url":"https://github.com/nicolo-ribaudo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicolo-ribaudo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicolo-ribaudo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicolo-ribaudo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicolo-ribaudo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicolo-ribaudo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicolo-ribaudo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicolo-ribaudo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicolo-ribaudo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicolo-ribaudo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-07-02T13:25:04Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2454367300,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDI0NTQzNjczMDA=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/babel/babel/issues/events/2454367300","actor":{"login":"nicolo-ribaudo","id":7000710,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcwMDA3MTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7000710?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicolo-ribaudo","html_url":"https://github.com/nicolo-ribaudo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicolo-ribaudo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicolo-ribaudo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicolo-ribaudo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicolo-ribaudo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicolo-ribaudo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicolo-ribaudo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicolo-ribaudo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicolo-ribaudo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicolo-ribaudo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-07-02T13:25:04Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/babel/babel/issues/comments/507684936","html_url":"https://github.com/babel/babel/issues/10154#issuecomment-507684936","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/babel/babel/issues/10154","id":507684936,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUwNzY4NDkzNg==","user":{"login":"nicolo-ribaudo","id":7000710,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcwMDA3MTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7000710?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicolo-ribaudo","html_url":"https://github.com/nicolo-ribaudo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicolo-ribaudo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicolo-ribaudo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicolo-ribaudo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicolo-ribaudo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicolo-ribaudo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicolo-ribaudo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicolo-ribaudo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicolo-ribaudo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicolo-ribaudo/re

We may add more business logic inside `validatePreset` to print preset-specific error message.\r\n\r\nI have also considered the following alternative designs:\r\n\r\n1) Pass down descriptor name to `matchPattern`.\r\nPro: The missing filename errors are still thrown in `matchPattern`\r\nCons: Introduce unnecessary signature complexity as this is not our primary execution path\r\n\r\n2) Add descriptor name to `ConfigContext`\r\nPro: The missing filename errors are still thrown in `matchPattern`\r\nCons: ConfigContext has to be mutated or cloned when running `buildPresetChain`. The `ConfigContext` is widely used across config chain building but descriptor name is only used to print this error.\r\n\r\n3) tryCatch `buildPresetChain`\r\nPros: Intuitive and fewer execution path\r\nCons: Any error from `buildPresetChain ` has to be matched once before they are
