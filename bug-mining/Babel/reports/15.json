When I remove the typescript plugin, it works fine, except then it is unable to parse/transform typescript.\r\n\r\nHere is what it does right now:\r\n```js\r\n\"use strict\";\r\n\r\nvar _ = _interopRequireDefault(require(\".\"));\r\n\r\nfunction _interopRequireDefault(obj) { return obj && obj.__esModule ? obj : { default: obj }; }\r\n\r\nconst foo = h(_.default, {\r\n  type: \"submit\"\r\n});\r\n```\r\nAs you can see, it removes the import of {h} from preact, instead of transforming it to a require\r\n\r\n### Possible Solution\r\nI'm not 100% sure about this, but it seems like the typescript plugin is doing some react-specific things for jsx, which makes it not work with preact and other jsx pragmas.\r\nhttps://github.com/babel/babel/blob/master/packages/babel-plugin-transform-typescript/src/index.js#L269\r\n\r\n### Context\r\nI want to use these things together:\r\n- Typescript\r\n- JSX\r\n- ES6 imports\r\n- Preact\r\n\r\n### Your Environment\r\n\r\n| software         | version(s)\r\n| ---------------- | -------\r\n| Babel            | ^7.0.0-beta.42\r\n| node             | v9.9.0\r\n| npm              | 5.7.1\r\n| Operating System | Arch Linux\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"hzoo","id":588473,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU4ODQ3Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/588473?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hzoo","html_url":"https://github.com/hzoo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hzoo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hzoo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hzoo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hzoo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hzoo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hzoo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hzoo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hzoo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hzoo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/babel/babel/issues/7631/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/babel/babel/issues/7631/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
