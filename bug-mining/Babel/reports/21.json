This means that the `isNodesEquivalent()` algorithm could potentially use this information to determine whether to compare the property values as AST nodes (i.e. recursively compare the values using `isNodesEquivalent()`) or as raw JS objects (i.e. compare the two objects via a shallow equality check).\r\n\r\n**Additional context/Screenshots**\r\nN/A\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"hzoo","id":588473,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU4ODQ3Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/588473?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hzoo","html_url":"https://github.com/hzoo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hzoo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hzoo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hzoo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hzoo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hzoo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hzoo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hzoo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hzoo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hzoo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/babel/babel/issues/8163/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/babel/babel/issues/8163/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
