So anyone struggling with this issue should be able to work around this using the versions above for now.","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/babel/babel/issues/comments/449158040/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"akonyer","id":2523927,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1MjM5Mjc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2523927?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/akonyer","html_url":"https://github.com/akonyer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akonyer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akonyer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akonyer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akonyer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akonyer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akonyer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akonyer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akonyer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akonyer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/babel/babel/issues/comments/449361430","html_url":"https://github.com/babel/babel/issues/8172#issuecomment-449361430","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/babel/babel/issues/8172","id":449361430,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ0OTM2MTQzMA==","user":{"login":"nicolo-ribaudo","id":7000710,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcwMDA3MTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7000710?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicolo-ribaudo","html_url":"https://github.com/nicolo-ribaudo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicolo-ribaudo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicolo-ribaudo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicolo-ribaudo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicolo-ribaudo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicolo-ribaudo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicolo-ribaudo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicolo-ribaudo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicolo-ribaudo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicolo-ribaudo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-12-21T11:13:58Z","updated_at":"2018-12-21T11:13:58Z","body":"Does it work if you use `@babel/plugin-transform-typescript` instead of the preset?

First, delete these files and folders in your project:\r\n\r\n    * node_modules\r\n    * package-lock.json\r\n    * yarn.lock\r\n\r\n  Then you need to decide which package manager you prefer to use.\r\n  We support both npm (https://npmjs.com) and yarn (http://yarnpkg.com/).\r\n  However, **they can't be used together in one project** so you need to pick one.\r\n\r\n  If you decided to use npm, run this in your project directory:\r\n\r\n    npm install -g npm@latest\r\n    npm install\r\n\r\n  This should fix your project.\r\n\r\n  If you decided to use yarn, update it first (https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install).\r\n  Then run in your project directory:\r\n\r\n    yarn\r\n\r\n  This should fix your project.\r\n\r\n  Importantly, **if you decided to use yarn, you should never run `npm install` in the project**.\r\n  For example, yarn users should run `yarn add <library>` instead of `npm install <library>`.\r\n  Otherwise your project will break again.\r\n\r\n  Have you done all these steps and still see the issue?\r\n  Please paste the output of `npm --version` and/or `yarn --version` to confirm.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nYes.\r\n```\r\nyarn --version\r\n1.13.0\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Which terms did you search for in User Guide?\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n  There are a few common documented problems, such as watcher not detecting changes, or build failing.\r\n  They are described in the Troubleshooting section of the User Guide:\r\n\r\n  https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/troubleshooting\r\n\r\n  Please scan these few sections for common problems.\r\n  Additionally, you can search the User Guide itself for something you're having issues with:\r\n\r\n  https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/\r\n\r\n  If you didn't find the solution, please share which words you searched for.\r\n  This helps us improve documentation for future readers who might encounter the same problem.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\"Typescript decorators abstract classes\".\r\n\r\n\r\n### Environment\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n  To help identify if a problem is specific to a platform, browser, or module version, information about your environment is required.\r\n  This enables the maintainers quickly reproduce the issue and give feedback.\r\n\r\n  Run the following command in your React app's folder in terminal.\r\n  Note: The result is copied to your clipboard directly.\r\n\r\n  `npx create-react-app --info`\r\n\r\n  Paste the output of the command in the section below.\r\n-->\r\n```\r\nEnvironment Info:\r\n\r\n  System:\r\n    OS: Linux 4.20 Arch Linux undefined\r\n    CPU: x64 Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-4790 CPU @ 3.60GHz\r\n  Binaries:\r\n    Node: 11.6.0 - /usr/bin/node\r\n    Yarn: 1.13.0 - /usr/bin/yarn\r\n    npm: 6.5.0 - /usr/bin/npm\r\n  Browsers:\r\n    Firefox: 64.0.2\r\n  npmPackages:\r\n    react: ^16.7.0 => 16.7.0 \r\n    react-dom: ^16.7.0 => 16.7.0 \r\n    react-scripts: 2.1.3 => 2.1.3 \r\n  npmGlobalPackages:\r\n    create-react-app: 1.3.0\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n  How would you describe your issue to someone who doesn’t know you or your project?\r\n  Try to write a sequence of steps that anybody can repeat to see the issue.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nBasically, the problem lies in https://github.com/babel/babel/issues/8172 :\r\n\r\n1. Add a file `Bar.ts`:\r\n```\r\nfunction decorate() {\r\n  return (target: any, propertyKey: string) => {\r\n    console.log(propertyKey);\r\n  };\r\n}\r\n\r\nabstract class Foo extends Object {\r\n  @decorate()\r\n  baz: String = \"baz\";\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport class Bar extends Foo {}\r\n```\r\n2. Add a jest test file `tests/Bar.test.ts`:\r\n```\r\nimport {Bar} from \"../Bar\";\r\n\r\nit('fails', () => {\r\n    const bar = new Bar();\r\n    expect(bar.baz).toEqual(\"baz\");\r\n});\r\n```\r\n3. `yarn run test`\r\n\r\n\r\n### Expected Behavior\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n  How did you expect the tool to behave?\r\n  It’s fine if you’re not sure your understanding is correct.\r\n  Just write down what you thought would happen.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThe jest test runs successfully.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Actual Behavior\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n  Did something go wrong?\r\n  Is something broken, or not behaving as you expected?\r\n  Please attach screenshots if possible! They are extremely helpful for diagnosing issues.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n```\r\n FAIL  src/test/Bar.test.ts\r\n  ● Test suite failed to run\r\n\r\n    Jest encountered an unexpected token\r\n\r\n    This usually means that you are trying to import a file which Jest cannot parse, e.g. it's not plain JavaScript.\r\n\r\n    By default, if Jest sees a Babel config, it will use that to transform your files, ignoring \"node_modules\".\r\n\r\n    Here's what you can do:\r\n     • To have some of your \"node_modules\" files transformed, you can specify a custom \"transformIgnorePatterns\" in your config.\r\n     • If you need a custom transformation specify a \"transform\" option in your config.\r\n     • If you simply want to mock your non-JS modules (e.g. binary assets) you can stub them out with the \"moduleNameMapper\" config option.\r\n\r\n    You'll find more details and examples of these config options in the docs:\r\n    https://jestjs.io/docs/en/configuration.html\r\n\r\n    Details:\r\n\r\n    /home/ought/Coding/Web/Frontend/test-app/src/Bar.ts:24\r\n    let Foo = (_dec = decorate(), (_class = abstract class Foo extends Object {\r\n                                                     ^^^^^\r\n\r\n    SyntaxError: Unexpected token class\r\n\r\n    > 1 | import {Bar} from \"../Bar\";\r\n        | ^\r\n      2 | \r\n      3 | it('fails', () => {\r\n      4 |     const bar = new Bar();\r\n\r\n      at ScriptTransformer._transformAndBuildScript (node_modules/jest-runtime/build/script_transformer.js:403:17)\r\n      at Object.<anonymous> (src/test/Bar.test.ts:1:1)\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Reproducible Demo\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n  If you can, please share a project that reproduces the issue.\r\n  This is the single most effective way to get an issue fixed soon.\r\n\r\n  There are two ways to do it:\r\n\r\n    * Create a new app and try to reproduce the issue in it.\r\n      This is useful if you roughly know where the problem is, or can’t share the real code.\r\n\r\n    * Or, copy your app and remove things until you’re left with the minimal reproducible demo.\r\n      This is useful for finding the root cause. You may then optionally create a new project.\r\n\r\n  This is a good guide to creating bug demos: https://stackoverflow.com/help/mcve\r\n  Once you’re done, push the project to GitHub and paste the link to it below:\r\n-->\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/StragaSevera/test-app\r\n\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n  What happens if you skip this step?\r\n\r\n  We will try to help you, but in many cases it is impossible because crucial\r\n  information is missing.
