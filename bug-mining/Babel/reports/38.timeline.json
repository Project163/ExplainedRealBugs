string | undefined;\r\n```\r\nyou support it because it is perfectly legal js code.\r\n```js\r\nlet x;\r\n```\r\nthe same is with namespace in some cases.\r\n```ts\r\nexport namespace MyComponent{\r\n  export type Type1 = {foo: string}\r\n}\r\n```\r\nis legal in js, because you can remove hole namespace, but you throw an exception instead\r\n\r\nwhen I declare it like this\r\n```ts\r\nexport declare namespace MyComponent{\r\n  export type Type1 = {foo: string}\r\n}\r\n```\r\nbabel will NOT complain. **witch is some kind of workaround for me and many others I presume.**\r\n\r\nbut what would be ideal is the following:\r\n\r\nyou could throw errors only when we have something with implementation in namespace\r\n```ts\r\nexport namespace MyComponent{\r\n  export type Type1 = {foo: string}\r\n  export interface Type2 { foo: string }\r\n  export abstract class C1 { x(); }\r\n}\r\n```\r\nis OK\r\n```ts\r\nexport namespace MyComponent{\r\n  export const someData = {foo: 'value'}\r\n  export function f(){}\r\n  export class C1 { x(){} }\r\n}\r\n```\r\nis NOT OK all the time, because of implementation in ambient context.\r\n```ts\r\nexport namespace MyComponent{\r\n  export class C1 {}\r\n  export const index = 5\r\n  export const val = 'val'\r\n}\r\n```\r\nis OK some times, it depends on usage. this is valid usage\r\n```ts\r\nconst val: typeof MyComponent.val = 'val'\r\nconst index: typeof MyComponent.index = 5\r\nclass C2 implements MyComponent.C1 {}\r\n```\r\nthis is NOT OK\r\n```ts\r\nconst val = MyComponent.val\r\nconst index = MyComponent.index\r\nclass C2 extends MyComponent.C1 {}\r\n```\r\n\r\nin TS when I declare namespace I can only put types, and use them as types\r\n\r\n```ts\r\ndeclare namespace MyComponent {\r\n  export type Props1 = { prop1: string }; // valid\r\n  export interface Props2 { prop1: string; } // valid\r\n  export class C1 {} //valid, possible runtime error\r\n  export const prop1 = 0; //valid, possible runtime error\r\n  export const prop2 = 'aaa'; //valid, possible runtime error\r\n  export const prop3 = { bla: 1 }; //compilation error\r\n  export function bla() {} //compilation error\r\n  export class C2 { x(){} } //compilation error\r\n}\r\n```\r\nbut event TS will not prevent me from generating runtime error\r\n```ts\r\nclass C2 extends MyComponent.C1 { } //it is runtime error, it compiles fine.\r\n```\r\nI thing it would be cool to show some warning when I  put classes or consts with string and number literals in namespace and show errors for function and any other literals.\r\n\r\nTS compiler could do the same thing on its side and make things compatible with your behaviour.\r\nThere are issues with namespaces is typescript after transpiration to js, this could fix some problems there also https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/issues/21327 maybe namespaces shoud be use only for type declarations? @andy-ms what do you think?","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/babel/babel/issues/comments/419979558/reactions","total_count":17,"+1":14,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":3,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"maciejw","id":336719,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzNjcxOQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/336719?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/maciejw","html_url":"https://github.com/maciejw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maciejw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maciejw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maciejw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maciejw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maciejw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maciejw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maciejw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maciejw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maciejw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":1836494276,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MTgzNjQ5NDI3Ng==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/babel/babel/issues/events/1836494276","actor":null,"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-09-10T16:41:27Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":1836494277,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDE4MzY0OTQyNzc=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/babel/babel/issues/events/1836494277","actor":null,"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-09-10T16:41:27Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"actor":{"login":"OneCyrus","id":7747800,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc3NDc4MDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7747800?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/OneCyrus","html_url":"https://github.com/OneCyrus","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OneCyrus/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OneCyrus/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OneCyrus/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OneCyrus/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OneCyrus/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OneCyrus/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OneCyrus/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OneCyrus/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OneCyrus/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-09-10T16:44:49Z","updated_at":"2018-09-10T16:44:49Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotansimha/graphql-code-generator/issues/582","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotansimha/graphql-code-generator","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotansimha/graphql-code-generator/issues/582/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotansimha/graphql-code-generator/issues/582/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotansimha/graphql-code-generator/issues/582/events","html_url":"https://github.com/dotansimha/graphql-code-generator/issues/582","id":358296511,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWUzNTgyOTY1MTE=","number":582,"title":"typescript

some initial bickering that Typescript support does not include this and that I've decided to give it a try. Unfortunately, I've stumbled upon a big obstacle.\r\n\r\nI am using [graphql-code-generator](https://github.com/dotansimha/graphql-code-generator) package to generate strong types for my GraphQL queries. In the essence, it generates types like this.\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nexport namespace GLogoutWidget {\r\n  export type Variables = {\r\n    id: string\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  export type Query = {\r\n    __typename?: 'Query'\r\n    user: User\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  export type User = {\r\n    __typename?: 'User'\r\n    id: string\r\n    firstName?: string | null\r\n    lastName?: string | null\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nUsage of namespaces in this is extremely helpful as it clearly separates types for each query/mutation. Compared to `apollo-codegen` which outputs extremely long and annoying names for types, this is a clear win.\r\n\r\nI would like to know if namespace support is such a huge technical problem that it cannot be included. I mean when bundling the app it should be mostly about stripping type information and let the TypeScript worry about type checking. I am kinda lost why such a decision has been made to have a separate TypeScript parser that's limited like this.\r\n\r\n/cc

The gist of it is that there is a [Typescript implementation](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/babel-plugin-transform-typescript) coming from Babel team and it's somewhat limited for [a various reasons](https://github.com/babel/babel/issues/8244). The most notable is that namespaces are not supported.\r\n\r\nNow in that React issue there is some mention of \"ES modules\" that are cool & better variant. So I am wondering where is the truth. I got kinda used to how graphql-code-generator works and I happy with it. However, I would not like to lock myself out from a future stuff.\r\n\r\nI am aware that this could be solved by custom generator, but honestly, my TypeScript knowledge is limited on this subject and I am not sure how it should look like to have similar quality approach a with namespaces.\r\n\r\nI was thinking about some slighly different approach and I am not sure if GCG is able to that. Instead of a single file with all types if there could be a separate file per each source file with a generated types which would references a shared file with inputs/enums.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotansimha/graphql-code-generator/issues/766/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dotansimha/graphql-code-generator/issues/766/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/babel/babel/issues/comments/437868553","html_url":"https://github.com/babel/babel/issues/8244#issuecomment-437868553","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/babel/babel/issues/8244","id":437868553,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQzNzg2ODU1Mw==","user":{"login":"chawax","id":5655399,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTUzOTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5655399?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chawax","html_url":"https://github.com/chawax","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chawax/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chawax/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chawax/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chawax/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chawax/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chawax/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chawax/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chawax/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chawax/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-11-12T12:51:53Z","updated_at":"2018-11-12T12:51:53Z","body":"The fact that Babel 7 doesn't support Typescript namespaces is very annoying for me. In my React Native project I use Swagger code generators to generate my REST client layer. But all the generators I found use namespaces (and also enums that are not supported neither by Babel 7 if I understood well). Changing the templates is too much complicated and time consuming, so this is not an option for me. So what is the solution ? It worked well with previous releases of RN, but it fails with RN 0.57. Is there a way to tell Babel 7 not compiling Typescript ? So that it could work as it was the case with RN < 0.57 ?","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/babel/babel/issues/comments/437868553/reactions","total_count":40,"+1":40,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"chawax","id":5655399,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTUzOTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5655399?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chawax","html_url":"https://github.com/chawax","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chawax/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chawax/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chawax/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chawax/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chawax/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chawax/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chawax/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chawax/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chawax/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}}]
