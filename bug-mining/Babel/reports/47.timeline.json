would not be an undefined export. Thanks @jj-choi for suggestions to the solution.\r\n\r\nAs I didn't find any specification for Flow, I have developed several [test cases] on Flow REPL. We revise the `flowParseInterfaceish` according to the following observations:\r\n\r\n| Declarations | Identifier Binding Type | Facts |\r\n| --- | --- | --- |\r\n| Interface<sub>[Declare]</sub> | `LEXICAL` | `interface I {}; interface I {}; ` will throw |\r\n| Type<sub>[Declare]</sub> | `LEXICAL` | `type A = string; type A = string;` will throw |\r\n| OpaqueType | `LEXICAL` | `opaque type A = string; opaque type A = string'` will throw |\r\n| Class<sub>[+Declare]</sub> | `VAR` | `declare class A {}; declare class A{};` does _not_ throw<br> but `declare class A {}; class A{};` will throw |\r\n| Variable<sub>[+Declare]</sub> | ??? | `declare var A; declare var A;` does _not_ throw<br> `declare var A; declare var A; var A` does _not_ throw |\r\n| Function<sub>[+Declare]</sub> | ??? | `declare function A(): void; declare function A(): void; function A() {}` does not throw |\r\n\r\nSince Class<sub>[+Declare]</sub> implies a `VAR` type binding identifier, I have changed the scope type of `DeclareModule` to `SCOPE_VAR`, otherwise the following snippet will throw:\r\n\r\n```js\r\ndeclare module M {\r\n  declare class C{}\r\n}\r\ndeclare class C{}\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Known issues\r\nWe haven't applied `declareName` for Variable<sub>[+Declare]</sub> and Function<sub>[+Declare]</sub> since they can share the identifier name with `VariableDeclaration` and `FunctionDeclaration`, which means the following snippet would fail\r\n\r\n```js\r\ndeclare var A;\r\ndeclare function B(): void;\r\nexport { A, B };\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe may solve this issue by introducing `flowVars` to `Scope` and record them in an array other than `scope.vars`. However, I suggest we submit another PR to solve it before this one gets too big to review.\r\n\r\n[test cases]: https://flow.org/try/#0EQVwzgpgBGAuBOBLAxrYBuAUJgJhZANgIbzSFFhhQDCAjFAN4C+We5pU5lNtAPACoA+Ri1z5iHRADtYEeADMiyaHRGtxJaLACeABxX0AvDATSA5li5VVzSwHspcHlGMAmLGPbQAtnZwgCaABZegZMKCg2CWhpWQUlAxFMUU9oqF9-QKgQxnDIjQ4dfWdjOCQpC2SPK2zQlKjNKFi5RWUoAEk69S8mmRaEjq7MGs6k1MaANxIoADUAMW60qfhZhcxl1Y8Gwr1ofiMoKRBvACM5RcaivYOj0-PMK6h9l0Pjs-gPO10iAEcQLV2T1cL1u7ywX1+-ygj34wOMoPu2G20HkICkqEQDlWAAoAJQALigEzsiBwFw4qPRsExUhxBKJJLJmEpGKx8zxSSAA","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/babel/babel/issues/10220/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/babel/babel/issues/10220/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/babel/babel/issues/comments/511317139","html_url":"https://github.com/babel/babel/issues/10044#issuecomment-511317139","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/babel/babel/issues/10044","id":511317139,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUxMTMxNzEzOQ==","user":{"login":"boris-petrov","id":278940,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3ODk0MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/278940?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/boris-petrov","html_url":"https://github.com/boris-petrov","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/boris-petrov/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/boris-petrov/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/boris-petrov/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/boris-petrov/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/boris-petrov/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/boris-petrov/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/boris-petrov/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/boris-petrov/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/boris-petrov/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-07-15T08:36:25Z","updated_at":"2019-07-15T08:36:25Z","body":"@JLHwung - did you manage to catch the issue?
