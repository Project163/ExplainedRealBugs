What's more, they're (mostly) duplicated between the `strings` and `raw`.\r\n\r\n```js\r\ntag`some template`;\r\n// \"some template\" \"some template\"\r\n_taggedTemplateLiteral([\"some template\"], [\"some template\"]);\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe only (I think) time that string arrays aren't duplicated is when an \"invalid\" escape sequence comes up (which are now valid, due to template literal revision).\r\n\r\n```js\r\ntag`test${1}\\xhello`;\r\n// \"invalid\" string becomes undefined\r\n_taggedTemplateLiteral([\"test\", void 0], [\"test\", \"\\\\xhello\"]);\r\n```\r\n\r\nAt worst, we could optimize the \"all valid strings\" case using slice:\r\n\r\n```js\r\n// default raw value to a slice of strings\r\nfunction _taggedTemplateLiteral(strings, raw = strings.slice()) {\r\n  return Object.freeze(Object.defineProperties(strings, {\r\n    raw: { value: Object.freeze(raw) }\r\n  }));\r\n}\r\n\r\n// all valid\r\ntag`some template`;\r\n_taggedTemplateLiteral([\"some template\"]);\r\n\r\n// some invalid\r\ntag`\\xhello`;\r\n// \"invalid\" string becomes undefined\r\n_taggedTemplateLiteral([void 0], [\"\\\\xhello\"]);\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut, realistically, we could just reuse the same string array (it's being frozen, anyways):\r\n\r\n```js\r\nfunction _taggedTemplateLiteral(strings, raw) {\r\n  return Object.freeze(Object.defineProperties(strings, {\r\n    raw: { value: raw ? Object.freeze(raw) : strings }\r\n  }));\r\n}\r\n```","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/babel/babel/issues/7352/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/babel/babel/issues/7352/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/babel/babel/issues/comments/364036892","html_url":"https://github.com/babel/babel/issues/7350#issuecomment-364036892","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/babel/babel/issues/7350","id":364036892,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM2NDAzNjg5Mg==","user":{"login":"bashmish","id":137844,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNzg0NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/137844?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bashmish","html_url":"https://github.com/bashmish","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bashmish/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bashmish/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bashmish/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bashmish/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bashmish/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bashmish/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bashmish/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bashmish/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bashmish/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-02-08T08:25:42Z","updated_at":"2018-02-08T09:30:58Z","body":"We have a related issue here with HTML Imports https://github.com/Polymer/polymer-cli/issues/950 and a need to fix it on the Babel side in the best case.\r\n\r\nI do understand that this is likely not Babel's responsibility to deal with such edge cases, but at the same time I ask myself: are there many cases where caching of a template literal is really helpful?

the context has sort of been lost. I just wanted to explain why we do things the way we do.\r\n\r\nThere was a comment above from @bashmish about why it's werid that TypeScript doesn't cache the template object when a file isn't a module (i.e. when you don't have imports or exports in a module). I was mainly responding to that.\r\n\r\nThe reason is that in a module, you can always ensure you have a unique variable that won't collide with anything else for a template object, but in the global scope, you're susceptible to collisions. So we kept the no-caching behavior to avoid name clashes\r\n\r\n```ts\r\n(function () {\r\n  tag(__makeTemplateObject([\"some template\"], [\"some template\"]));\r\n})();\r\n```\r\n\r\nas opposed to the behavior you might encounter in a module:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nvar _a;\r\n(function() {\r\n    tag(_a || (_a = __makeTemplateObject([\"some template\"], [\"some template\"])));\r\n})();\r\n```\r\n\r\nI was explaining our eventual strategy for dealing with name clashes in the global scope. We were thinking of using our `makeTemplateObject` function as a map to have an easy way to reference these objects, but maybe generating a very long global identifier that's sufficiently distinguished by its contents would be good enough.\r\n\r\nThis would actually give you the old spec-compliant behavior in the global scope, with the new spec-compliant behavior in modules. I think that's good enough for most
