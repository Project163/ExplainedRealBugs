So in practice the `generate` variable from `import generate from '@babel/generator` is an object with a property `default`.\r\n\r\nThis causes failures like: \r\n\r\n```\r\nTypeError: generate is not a function\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior:**\r\n\r\nBabel ships ESM variant of their tooling using NodeJS package exports, or their type definitions do not suggest a default export (although I don't think there can be a named binding called `default`)\r\n\r\n### Environment\r\n\r\n```\r\n  System:\r\n    OS: Linux 5.19 Debian GNU/Linux rodete 12 (rodete)\r\n  Binaries:\r\n    Node: 16.14.2 - ~/bin/node/bin/node\r\n    Yarn: 1.22.17 - ~/bin/node/bin/yarn\r\n    npm: 8.19.2 - ~/bin/node/bin/npm\r\n  npmPackages:\r\n    @babel/cli: 7.19.3 => 7.19.3 \r\n    @babel/core: 7.19.3 => 7.19.3 \r\n    @babel/generator: 7.19.5 => 7.19.5 \r\n    @babel/parser: 7.19.4 => 7.19.4 \r\n    @babel/preset-env: 7.19.4 => 7.19.4 \r\n    @babel/template: 7.18.10 => 7.18.10 \r\n    @babel/traverse: 7.19.4 => 7.19.4 \r\n    @babel/types: 7.19.4 => 7.19.4 \r\n```\r\n\r\n### Possible solution\r\n\r\nBabel would ship an ESM-compatible output flavor in their packages. Best used in combination with NodeJS `package.json` `exports`.\r\n\r\n### Additional context\r\n\r\nRelated to https://github.com/babel/babel/issues/12363 I assume.\r\nAlso https://github.com/babel/babel/issues/13855#issuecomment-945123514 (maybe it should be kept for tracking?)\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"nicolo-ribaudo","id":7000710,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcwMDA3MTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7000710?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicolo-ribaudo","html_url":"https://github.com/nicolo-ribaudo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicolo-ribaudo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicolo-ribaudo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicolo-ribaudo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicolo-ribaudo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicolo-ribaudo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicolo-ribaudo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicolo-ribaudo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicolo-ribaudo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicolo-ribaudo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/babel/babel/issues/15269/reactions","total_count":4,"+1":4,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/babel/babel/issues/15269/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
