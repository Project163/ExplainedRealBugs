Babel has quite **some bugs**. But I was able to get work around them, it was hard.\r\n  - Use `babel.config.js` as `.babelrc.js` extends seems to be broken with the `babel-plugin-module-resolver` module. https://github.com/babel/babel/pull/7358\r\n  - Disable the loose mode with the es mode. https://github.com/babel/babel/issues/8323\r\n  - Remove flow. There is an issue with Babel that prevents us from moving forward with the flow syntax. Flow hasn't been of any help for us the last 6 months, mainly because we didn't invest in it. Let's assume our position by removing it. https://github.com/babel/babel/issues/8157\r\n  - An obscure bug with the ignore option of the CLI, it doesn't work, we have to force `ignore: ['**/*.test.js'],` in the config. https://github.com/babel/babel/issues/8224\r\n- Upgrade Next.js with https://github.com/zeit/next.js/pull/4766.\r\n- For some reason I can't explain, the `@material-ui/core` package is 6% smaller:\r\n```diff\r\n    name: 'The size of all the modules of material-ui.',\r\n    webpack: true,\r\n    path: 'packages/material-ui/build/index.js',\r\n-
