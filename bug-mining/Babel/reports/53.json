If there's an issue with new experimental syntax you might need check if it's supported by @babel/eslint-plugin.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n**Current Behavior**\r\n`scope.crawl()` does not add references to bindings correctly in some cases. In particular I get the bug when referencing a class inside a class method.\r\n\r\n**Input Code**\r\nhttps://github.com/regiontog/babel/compare/master...bug/missing-references-after-crawl\r\n\r\n```js\r\nconst path = getPath(\"class a { build() { return new a(); } }\");\r\npath.scope.crawl();\r\nconst referencePaths = path.scope.bindings.a.referencePaths;\r\nexpect(referencePaths).toHaveLength(1);\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior/code**\r\nI expect the binding `a` to have 1 reference inside the scope of the `build` class method after a `crawl`. The binding has 1 reference before the `crawl` call is made.\r\n\r\n**Environment**\r\n<!--- Tip: Instead of filling out the questions below, you can run `npx envinfo --preset babel` and paste the result below ``` -->\r\n```\r\nSystem:\r\n    OS: Linux 5.4 Arch Linux\r\n  Binaries:\r\n    Node: 13.3.0 - /usr/bin/node\r\n    Yarn: 1.21.0 - /usr/bin/yarn\r\n    npm: 6.12.1 - /usr/bin/npm\r\n  Monorepos:\r\n    Lerna: 3.19.0\r\nnpmPackages:\r\n    @babel/cli: ^7.7.0 => 7.7.5\r\n    @babel/core: ^7.7.2 => 7.7.5\r\n    @babel/eslint-plugin-development: ^1.0.1 => 1.0.1\r\n    @babel/plugin-proposal-class-properties: ^7.7.0 => 7.7.4\r\n    @babel/plugin-proposal-export-namespace-from: ^7.5.2 => 7.7.4\r\n    @babel/plugin-proposal-nullish-coalescing-operator: ^7.4.4 => 7.7.4\r\n    @babel/plugin-proposal-numeric-separator: ^7.2.0 => 7.7.4\r\n    @babel/plugin-proposal-object-rest-spread: ^7.7.4 => 7.7.4\r\n    @babel/plugin-proposal-optional-chaining: ^7.6.0 => 7.7.5\r\n    @babel/plugin-transform-flow-strip-types: ^7.7.4 => 7.7.4\r\n    @babel/plugin-transform-for-of: ^7.7.4 => 7.7.4\r\n    @babel/plugin-transform-modules-commonjs: ^7.7.0 => 7.7.5\r\n    @babel/plugin-transform-runtime: ^7.6.2 => 7.7.6\r\n    @babel/preset-env: ^7.7.1 => 7.7.6\r\n    @babel/preset-flow: ^7.0.0 => 7.7.4\r\n    @babel/register: ^7.7.0 => 7.7.4\r\n    @babel/runtime: ^7.7.2 => 7.7.6\r\n    babel-eslint: ^11.0.0-beta.2 => 11.0.0-beta.2\r\n    babel-jest: ^24.9.0 => 24.9.0\r\n    babel-plugin-transform-charcodes: ^0.2.0 => 0.2.0\r\n    eslint: ^6.0.1 => 6.7.2\r\n    eslint-config-babel: ^9.0.0 => 9.0.0\r\n    gulp-babel: ^8.0.0 => 8.0.0\r\n    jest: ^24.9.0 => 24.9.0\r\n    lerna: ^3.19.0 => 3.19.0\r\n    rollup-plugin-babel: ^4.0.0 => 4.3.3\r\n```\r\n- How you are using Babel: API\r\n\r\n**Possible Solution**\r\n<!--- If you have suggestions on a fix for the bug -->\r\nIt seems suspect to me to add the reference to a binding in the references own scope [here](https://github.com/babel/babel/blob/d389b702e65bfb0a3cc8258907db76560491547a/packages/babel-traverse/src/scope/index.js#L756)\r\n\r\n**Additional context/Screenshots**\r\nOutput of test linked above:\r\n```\r\nscope › binding paths › reference paths after crawl\r\n\r\n    expect(received).toHaveLength(expected)\r\n\r\n    Expected length: 1\r\n    Received length: 0\r\n    Received array:  []\r\n\r\n      276 |       path.scope.crawl();\r\n      277 |       const referencePaths = path.scope.bindings.a.referencePaths;\r\n    > 278 |       expect(referencePaths).toHaveLength(1);\r\n          |                              ^\r\n      279 |     });\r\n      280 |   });\r\n      281 |\r\n\r\n      at Object.<anonymous> (packages/babel-traverse/test/scope.js:278:30)\r\n```\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"JLHwung","id":3607926,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2MDc5MjY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3607926?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JLHwung","html_url":"https://github.com/JLHwung","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JLHwung/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JLHwung/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JLHwung/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JLHwung/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JLHwung/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JLHwung/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JLHwung/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JLHwung/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JLHwung/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/babel/babel/issues/10896/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/babel/babel/issues/10896/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
