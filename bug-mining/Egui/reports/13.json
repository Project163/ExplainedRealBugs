If there is, add a comment to it instead!\r\n\r\nPlease also check if the bug is still present in latest master! Do so by adding the following lines to your Cargo.toml:\r\n\r\n\r\n[patch.crates-io]\r\negui = { git = \"https://github.com/emilk/egui\", branch = \"master\" }\r\n# if you're using eframe:\r\neframe = { git = \"https://github.com/emilk/egui\", branch = \"master\" }\r\n-->\r\n\r\n**Describe the bug**\r\nAs a continuation of the work started with https://github.com/emilk/egui/pull/1634 it would also be good to update EFrame to be able to defer the initialization of render state until the app is first resumed (and be able to re-create windows/surfaces for further Suspend/Resumed events) so that EFrame can be used to build Android applications.\r\n\r\nRight now if you try and run an EFrame based application on Android you will simply get a black screen.\r\n\r\n<!-- A clear and concise description of what the bug is.
