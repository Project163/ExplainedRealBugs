This prevents any touch interactions with dom elements shown on top of the canvas.\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\n\r\nPaste the following in the console on egui.rs (to create a simple html dialog):\r\n\r\n```js\r\nlet dialog = document.createElement(\"dialog\");\r\nlet button = document.createElement(\"button\");\r\nbutton.innerHTML = \"Hello\";\r\ndialog.appendChild(button);\r\nbutton.onclick = () => alert(\"button click!!\");\r\ndocument.body.appendChild(dialog);\r\ndialog.show()\r\n```\r\nClicking the button now does nothing. (Make sure you enabled the device toolbar and set it to e.g. iPhone SE)\r\n\r\nIf we forcefully remove the egui touchend listener from document via\r\n```js\r\ndocument.removeEventListener(\"touchend\", getEventListeners(document).touchend[0].listener)\r\n```\r\nthe button will become clickable.\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nEgui shouldn't interfere with other dom elements. Maybe the touchend listener doesn't need preventDefault or it could be made configurable.\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\n<!-- Add any other context about the problem here. -->\r\n\r\nThe listener is added here: https://github.com/emilk/egui/blob/af404fec635ddd6390e2caeb3313cb9003b54835/crates/eframe/src/web/events.rs#L92\r\n\r\n* Related issue: https://github.com/emilk/egui/issues/3157","closed_by":{"login":"emilk","id":1148717,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNDg3MTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1148717?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/emilk","html_url":"https://github.com/emilk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emilk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emilk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emilk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emilk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emilk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emilk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emilk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emilk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emilk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/emilk/egui/issues/4752/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/emilk/egui/issues/4752/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
