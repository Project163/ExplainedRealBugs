I'm always frustrated when […] -->\r\negui converts `MouseWheel` events to `Scroll` or `Zoom` events based on which modifier keys are pressed ([here](https://github.com/emilk/egui/blob/530e9f667c0969b09edb68f7701f20c52a273d3a/crates/egui-winit/src/lib.rs#L551-L575) and [here](https://github.com/emilk/egui/blob/530e9f667c0969b09edb68f7701f20c52a273d3a/crates/eframe/src/web/events.rs#L396-L439)). The raw MouseWheel delta does not seem to be available anywhere. This makes it hard to implement alternative behaviors involving the mouse wheel, such as the one requested in #1164.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\n<!-- A clear and concise description of what you want to happen. -->\r\nMake the raw `MouseWheel` delta available somewhere in the [InputState](https://github.com/emilk/egui/blob/530e9f667c0969b09edb68f7701f20c52a273d3a/crates/egui/src/input_state.rs#L25) struct.\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\n<!-- A clear and concise description of any alternative solutions or features you've considered. -->\r\nI have implemented an example of alternative plot zoom/scroll controls in #2714, showing how this can be done currently. You basically have to reverse what egui does internally to deduce the mouse wheel delta from the `Zoom` and `Scroll` events, which is cumbersome and forces the developer to know internal details of the library. Moreover, it seems impossible to distinguish a mouse wheel event when Ctrl is down from other input events that translate to `Zoom`, so this workaround does not cover all cases.\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\n<!-- Add any other context or screenshots about the feature request here. -->\r\nI am willing to implement this myself, but I am not sure of how to reconcile it with the existing logic. The current `Scroll` and `Zoom` events should of course stay as they are to avoid breaking the entire library, but should the raw `MouseWheelDelta` be an additional duplicate event? Or an `Option` field that is reset at the start of every frame and then assigned if there is a MouseWheel event in the backend? Neither option seems very good, so I would like to brainstorm some alternatives.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/emilk/egui/issues/2718/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/emilk/egui/issues/2718/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"actor":{"login":"OmegaJak","id":4239887,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyMzk4ODc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4239887?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/OmegaJak","html_url":"https://github.com/OmegaJak","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OmegaJak/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OmegaJak/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OmegaJak/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OmegaJak/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OmegaJak/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OmegaJak/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OmegaJak/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OmegaJak/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OmegaJak/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-04-14T01:28:44Z","updated_at":"2023-04-14T01:28:44Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/emilk/egui/issues/2901","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/emilk/egui","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/emilk/egui/issues/2901/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/emilk/egui/issues/2901/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/emilk/egui/issues/2901/events","html_url":"https://github.com/emilk/egui/pull/2901","id":1667370458,"node_id":"PR_kwDOCd2s285OSB7R","number":2901,"title":"Plot

`allow_zoom` and `allow_drag` apply to both axes at the same time.
