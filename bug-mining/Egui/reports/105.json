Please describe.**\n\nThe `Slider` widget modifies the value after every text edit that can be parsed. In some cases it would be desirable to only apply the edits when the user finishes typing and accepts the final value.\n\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\n\nI would like to be able to configure whether the `Slider` widget applies the text edits immediately or only once the user accepts the text input.\n\nThere is already a precedent for this in the `DragValue` widget with `DragValue::update_while_editing`.\n\nAnd, in fact, the `Slider` widget itself contains an internal `DragValue` widget, it just doesn't expose its configuration. So, this might be just a matter of adding a `Slider::update_while_editing` API and propagating the setting to the internal `DragValue` widget.\n\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\n\n- Passing an intermediate value to the `Slider` widget and only updating the actual value based on that when the slider loses focus. This would be cumbersome compared to the proposed solution.\n- Duplicating and modifying the slider widget. Needless to say, this would not not be very maintainable.\n\n**Additional context**\n \nN/A\n","closed_by":{"login":"lucasmerlin","id":8009393,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgwMDkzOTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8009393?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasmerlin","html_url":"https://github.com/lucasmerlin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasmerlin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasmerlin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasmerlin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasmerlin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasmerlin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasmerlin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasmerlin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasmerlin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasmerlin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/emilk/egui/issues/5976/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/emilk/egui/issues/5976/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
