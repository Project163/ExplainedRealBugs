the bug**\r\nSince version 0.25 there is a visual bug when we set a custom window frame. In 0.24 the code below was making the window all green (as expected) with little margin.\r\n\r\n```rust\r\nlet frame = egui::containers::Frame::none()\r\n    .fill(egui::Color32::from_rgb(180, 220, 160))\r\n    .inner_margin(egui::Margin::symmetric(20.0, 20.0));\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn 0.25 and 0.26 the same code makes it only partially green with title bar area still with its original color, which is also not properly adjusted to the title.\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/emilk/egui/assets/26147774/7beda39f-da3f-432b-bdef-052bdb93e51c)\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\nSteps to reproduce the behavior:\r\n1. Go to egui_demo_lib -> window_options.rs\r\n2. Find creation of \"demo_window_options\" window\r\n3. Make it as below:\r\n\r\n```rust\r\nuse super::View as _;\r\nlet frame = egui::containers::Frame::none() // <-- new\r\n\t.fill(egui::Color32::from_rgb(180, 220, 160)) // <-- new\r\n\t.inner_margin(egui::Margin::symmetric(20.0, 20.0)); // <-- new\r\nlet mut window = egui::Window::new(title)\r\n\t.id(egui::Id::new(\"demo_window_options\"))\r\n\t.frame(frame) // <-- new\r\n\t.resizable(resizable)\r\n\t.constrain(constrain)\r\n\t.collapsible(collapsible)\r\n\t.title_bar(title_bar)\r\n\t.scroll2(scroll2)\r\n\t.enabled(enabled);\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nJust as in 0.24 and earlier, the whole window area should be colored green with no exception for title bar.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/emilk/egui/issues/4002/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":1},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/emilk/egui/issues/4002/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"actor":{"login":"rustbasic","id":127506429,"node_id":"U_kgDOB5mX_Q","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/127506429?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rustbasic","html_url":"https://github.com/rustbasic","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rustbasic/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rustbasic/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rustbasic/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rustbasic/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rustbasic/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rustbasic/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rustbasic/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rustbasic/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rustbasic/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-02-11T14:16:25Z","updated_at":"2024-02-11T14:16:25Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/emilk/egui/issues/4024","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/emilk/egui","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/emilk/egui/issues/4024/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/emilk/egui/issues/4024/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/emilk/egui/issues/4024/events","html_url":"https://github.com/emilk/egui/issues/4024","id":2128947418,"node_id":"I_kwDOCd2s285-5Sja","number":4024,"title":"Width

the bug**\r\nWhile testing #4002 (thanks for the fast fix!) on 0.26.1, I found another issue, or at least I think it was not desired. When setting the inner margin and stroke, the title bar is wider than the window's content as can be seen below. I've put some ridiculous values to show it clearly, but it's visible even when the stroke is just a few pixels wide.\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/emilk/egui/assets/26147774/0d5424d6-7227-432d-83b4-a6dfd64dde8e)\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\nSteps to reproduce the behavior:\r\n1. Go to egui_demo_lib -> window_options.rs\r\n2. Find creation of \"demo_window_options\" window\r\n3. Make it as below:\r\n\r\n```rust\r\nuse super::View as _;\r\nlet frame = egui::containers::Frame::none() // <-- new\r\n\t.fill(egui::Color32::from_rgb(180, 220, 160)) // <-- new\r\n\t.stroke(egui::Stroke::new(20.0, egui::Color32::from_rgb(40, 100, 30))) // <-- new\r\n\t.inner_margin(egui::Margin::symmetric(20.0, 20.0)); // <-- new\r\nlet mut window = egui::Window::new(title)\r\n\t.id(egui::Id::new(\"demo_window_options\"))\r\n\t.frame(frame) // <-- new\r\n\t.resizable(resizable)\r\n\t.constrain(constrain)\r\n\t.collapsible(collapsible)\r\n\t.title_bar(title_bar)\r\n\t.scroll2(scroll2)\r\n\t.enabled(enabled);\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nThe title bar should respect margin/stroke settings and have the same width as the rest of the window.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/emilk/egui/issues/4024/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":1},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/emilk/egui/issues/4024/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":11767358231,"node_id":"REFE_lADOCd2s285734udzwAAAAK9Y6MX","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/emilk/egui/issues/events/11767358231","actor":{"login":"rustbasic","id":127506429,"node_id":"U_kgDOB5mX_Q","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/127506429?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rustbasic","html_url":"https://github.com/rustbasic","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rustbasic/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rustbasic/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rustbasic/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rustbasic/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rustbasic/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rustbasic/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rustbasic/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rustbasic/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rustbasic/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"dc95b71f635ad828b08efe6fab3ce59bbaa1ded3","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rustbasic/egui/commits/dc95b71f635ad828b08efe6fab3ce59bbaa1ded3","created_at":"2024-02-11T15:35:37Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"actor":{"login":"rustbasic","id":127506429,"node_id":"U_kgDOB5mX_Q","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/127506429?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rustbasic","html_url":"https://github.com/rustbasic","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rustbasic/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rustbasic/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rustbasic/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rustbasic/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rustbasic/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rustbasic/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rustbasic/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rustbasic/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rustbasic/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-02-11T15:39:40Z","updated_at":"2024-02-11T15:39:40Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/emilk/egui/issues/4025","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/emilk/egui","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/emilk/egui/issues/4025/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/emilk/egui/issues/4025/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/emilk/egui/issues/4025/events","html_url":"https://github.com/emilk/egui/pull/4025","id":2129039654,"node_id":"PR_kwDOCd2s285mlDeX","number":4025,"title":"Width
