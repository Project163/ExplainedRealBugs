Then it would be a matter of keeping track of when the last pointer movement occurred, and only showing the tooltip if it's been longer than the specified time. One thing to note is that when the pointer is not moving, normally the UI does not repaint, so egui has to treat this delayed tooltip like it treats the other animations for it to work properly.\r\n\r\nAnother feature that other UI frameworks have is that the tooltip disappears when you press a key, and doesn't reappear until you move the pointer again. But that could probably be a separate issue, if egui users are interested in it.","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/emilk/egui/issues/comments/1675828782/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"YgorSouza","id":43298013,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzMjk4MDEz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/43298013?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/YgorSouza","html_url":"https://github.com/YgorSouza","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YgorSouza/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YgorSouza/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YgorSouza/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YgorSouza/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YgorSouza/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YgorSouza/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YgorSouza/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YgorSouza/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YgorSouza/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/emilk/egui/issues/comments/1675875504","html_url":"https://github.com/emilk/egui/issues/3232#issuecomment-1675875504","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/emilk/egui/issues/3232","id":1675875504,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCd2s285j49Sw","user":{"login":"emilk","id":1148717,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNDg3MTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1148717?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/emilk","html_url":"https://github.com/emilk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emilk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emilk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emilk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emilk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emilk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emilk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emilk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emilk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emilk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-08-12T11:59:03Z","updated_at":"2023-08-12T11:59:03Z","body":"I think it makes most sense with a global `tootlip_delay` option in `Style`.\r\n\r\nYou can follow the bread-crumbs of the similar `show_tooltips_only_when_still` options.
