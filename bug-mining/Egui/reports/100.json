The topmost modal will always be the most recently shown one.\n\n**To Reproduce**\n\nCreate an empty project, add eframe as dependency and copy the following source code into main.rs:\n\n```rust\nfn main() {\n    eframe::run_native(\n        \"modal order test\",\n        eframe::NativeOptions::default(),\n        Box::new(|_cctx| Ok(Box::new(App::default()))),\n    )\n    .unwrap();\n}\n\n#[derive(Default)]\nstruct App {\n    modal_a: bool,\n    modal_b: bool,\n}\n\nimpl eframe::App for App {\n    fn update(&mut self, ctx: &eframe::egui::Context, _frame: &mut eframe::Frame) {\n        eframe::egui::CentralPanel::default().show(ctx, |ui| {\n            if ui.button(\"Show modals\").clicked() {\n                self.modal_a = true;\n                self.modal_b = true;\n            }\n        });\n\n        if self.modal_a {\n            eframe::egui::Modal::new(\"modal a\".into()).show(ctx, |ui| {\n                ui.label(\"A\");\n                if ui.button(\"Close\").clicked() {\n                    self.modal_a = false;\n                }\n            });\n        }\n        if self.modal_b {\n            eframe::egui::Modal::new(\"modal b\".into()).show(ctx, |ui| {\n                ui.label(\"B\");\n                if ui.button(\"Close\").clicked() {\n                    self.modal_b = false;\n                }\n            });\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nFrom my understanding of the docs, modal \"B\" should always be on top of modal \"A\" after pressing the \"Show modals\"-button. Both `Modal`s are newly created in the same frame, but modal \"B\" is shown last in the `update`-method. The first time I click \"Show modals\", it is correct, but after closing both modals and clicking \"Show modals\" again, \"A\" is on top of \"B\". The next time it's switched again, etc.\n\n**Desktop**\n - OS: debian testing, XFCE","closed_by":{"login":"vkahl","id":42325420,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyMzI1NDIw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/42325420?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vkahl","html_url":"https://github.com/vkahl","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vkahl/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vkahl/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vkahl/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vkahl/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vkahl/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vkahl/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vkahl/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vkahl/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vkahl/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/emilk/egui/issues/5788/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/emilk/egui/issues/5788/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
