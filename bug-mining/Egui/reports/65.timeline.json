the bug**\r\nWhen all y values are identically the same, the calculated y bounds will be considered invalid and the default y-range of [0, 1] will be used instead. The same bug applies to x as well.\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\nI've created an example application here:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/nknotts/egui/blob/added-plot-bounds-example/examples/plot_bounds/src/main.rs\r\n\r\nThe gist is\r\n\r\n```\r\n            let x_range = 0..1000;\r\n            let single2: PlotPoints = x_range\r\n                .clone()\r\n                .map(|i| {\r\n                    let x = i as f64 * 0.01;\r\n                    [x, 2.0]\r\n                })\r\n                .collect();\r\n\r\n            ui.label(\"All values == 2, completely missing\");\r\n            Plot::new(\"plot3\")\r\n                .allow_drag(false)\r\n                .allow_zoom(false)\r\n                .allow_scroll(false)\r\n                .height(row_height)\r\n                .show(ui, |plot_ui| plot_ui.line(Line::new(single2)));\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhere determining the bounds, there is\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/emilk/egui/blob/a1f6f6821366c95b36b43e83ba67bc7e8645e14a/crates/egui/src/widgets/plot/mod.rs#L831\r\n\r\n```\r\n        let auto_x = !bounds_modified.x && (!min_auto_bounds.is_valid_x() || auto_bounds.x);\r\n        let auto_y = !bounds_modified.y && (!min_auto_bounds.is_valid_y() || auto_bounds.y);\r\n```\r\n\r\nUltimately there is a call to\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/emilk/egui/blob/a1f6f6821366c95b36b43e83ba67bc7e8645e14a/crates/egui/src/widgets/plot/transform.rs#L52\r\n\r\n```\r\n    pub fn is_valid(&self) -> bool {\r\n        self.is_finite() && self.width() > 0.0 && self.height() > 0.0\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\nwhere, in this case, the height will be `== 0.0` since all values are the same. Since the y bounds are not valid, the default bounds of `[0, 1]` are used.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nAn appropriate bound to be calculated for this case.\r\n\r\n**Screenshots**\r\n<img

Fixes #3808\r\n* Fixes #2307\r\n\r\nThis PR improves the behaviour of auto-bounds with data that:\r\n- is a single point\r\n- where all X values are the same (e.g. vertical line)\r\n- where all Y values are the same (e.g. horizontal line)\r\n\r\nIn all case, the auto-bound now aim to center on the data. For span, when available, it use the same as the other axis. If the data range of the other axis is also degenerate, then it defaults to +/- 1.0.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/emilk/egui/assets/49431240/a62d2b5b-7856-4415-8534-83dc58cfac98\r\n\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n<summary>Test code</summary>\r\n\r\n```rust\r\n#![cfg_attr(not(debug_assertions),
