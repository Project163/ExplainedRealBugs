I didn't run the code before the commit that introduced this (https://github.com/emilk/egui/commit/834e2e9f5090824b853ba585f5f8b3f3a47f2359) to figure out why it wasn't happening previously.\r\n\r\nThe workaround on [this line](https://github.com/emilk/egui/blob/627e1b3d5054df9961b5a467ac7c7b866a04d913/crates/eframe/src/native/run.rs#L150C13-L150C13) is at least partially to blame.\r\n\r\nWhen there's a `RedrawEventsCleared` event on Windows, we redraw. This event is triggered when `request_repaint_after` is called, because that leads to a winit `RepaintAt` or `Wait` event being triggered, which is immediately followed by `RedrawEventsCleared`. This then triggers another run of the main ui. So if the main ui is calling `request_repaint_after`, then the cycle continues and we continuously repaint. This only happens on Windows because that workaround is only applied for Windows - on other platforms, it uses the `RedrawRequested` event to trigger a repaint, which isn't triggered by `Wait` or `RepaintAt` immediately.\r\n\r\nThis bug only happens when the `request_repaint_after` is called inside the main ui paint loop. The button inside the demo app that calls it from another thread works fine, even on Windows.\r\n\r\nThere's another bug confusing things here - the `frame_nr` inside `UserEvent::RequestRepaint` is always 1 less than the frame number when checked inside the winit event loop if `request_repaint_after` was called during the main ui update. This prevents us from properly scheduling repaints much of the time because of [this line](https://github.com/emilk/egui/blob/627e1b3d5054df9961b5a467ac7c7b866a04d913/crates/eframe/src/native/run.rs#L161).\r\n\r\nI have two very dubious fixes and some unpolished tweaks to the demo app for testing this in #3275. I removed the workaround and allowed off-by-one for the frame number. Neither seems like a real fix. With these changes, calling `request_repaint_after` every time inside the main ui loop works as expected, and so does calling it from another thread - but a one-off call of `request_repaint_after` inside the ui loop does not trigger a repaint later.\r\n\r\nI'm looking for suggestions of what the proper fix(es) might be - I don't think what I've done in my PR are adequate or correct.","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/emilk/egui/issues/comments/1690753038/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"OmegaJak","id":4239887,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyMzk4ODc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4239887?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/OmegaJak","html_url":"https://github.com/OmegaJak","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OmegaJak/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OmegaJak/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OmegaJak/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OmegaJak/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OmegaJak/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OmegaJak/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OmegaJak/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OmegaJak/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OmegaJak/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/emilk/egui/issues/comments/1691008028","html_url":"https://github.com/emilk/egui/issues/3109#issuecomment-1691008028","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/emilk/egui/issues/3109","id":1691008028,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCd2s285kyrwc","user":{"login":"emilk","id":1148717,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNDg3MTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1148717?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/emilk","html_url":"https://github.com/emilk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emilk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emilk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emilk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emilk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emilk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emilk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emilk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emilk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emilk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-08-24T05:05:46Z","updated_at":"2023-08-24T05:05:46Z","body":"Thanks

Reproduce**\r\nSteps to reproduce the behavior:\r\n1. Take https://pastebin.com/raw/6kMba2X5\r\n2. Run, see button getting wider, despite there is no mouse or keyboard input and large (but valid) `request_repaint_after` duration\r\n3. Comment `ctx.request_repaint_after(dur);` and run again\r\n4. Button gets wider only on input\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\n`request_repaint_after` should request repaint after set duration, not act as instant repaint request\r\n\r\n\r\n**Desktop (please
