Why user should care if some internal _temporary_ UI data is not saved correctly between runs of different versions of their program? I think a user should use only functions `get_or_insert(Id, T) -> &T`, `get_or_default(Id) -> &T`, and `insert(Id, T)` and that's all. They can't return `Option<>` or can't panic because they will insert provided/default value if some error happens. With this approach and this interface we can stop bothering about error origin: downcast error, deferred deserializing error, we can just insert the correct new/default value.\r\n\r\nBut this is just an idea. And possibly this can create some obscure and hard-to-find errors for complicated interfaces.","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/emilk/egui/issues/comments/808662510/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"optozorax","id":18114381,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MTE0Mzgx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18114381?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/optozorax","html_url":"https://github.com/optozorax","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/optozorax/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/optozorax/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/optozorax/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/optozorax/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/optozorax/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/optozorax/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/optozorax/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/optozorax/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/optozorax/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/emilk/egui/issues/comments/808663869","html_url":"https://github.com/emilk/egui/issues/255#issuecomment-808663869","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/emilk/egui/issues/255","id":808663869,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDgwODY2Mzg2OQ==","user":{"login":"optozorax","id":18114381,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MTE0Mzgx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18114381?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/optozorax","html_url":"https://github.com/optozorax","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/optozorax/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/optozorax/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/optozorax/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/optozorax/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/optozorax/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/optozorax/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/optozorax/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/optozorax/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/optozorax/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-03-27T05:54:19Z","updated_at":"2021-03-27T05:54:19Z","body":"I believe this feature can be done in two PRs:\r\n1.
