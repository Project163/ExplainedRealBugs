So when `ctx.request_repaint` is called from another thread and the ui thread has a lock on the `Context` the application just panics with the following message:\r\n\r\n```\r\nThe application panicked (crashed).\r\nMessage:  already mutably borrowed\r\nLocation: C:\\Users\\ME\\.cargo\\registry\\src\\github.com-1ecc6299db9ec823\\atomic_refcell-0.1.8\\src\\lib.rs:126\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe solution to this would be to just have a way to enable or enable by default the `multi_threaded` feature on epaint. But it would leave this discrepency between different parts of code using `std::sync::Mutex`, `parking_lot::Mutex` and `AtomicRefCell` for depending on features or just what part of the code they are in. Standardizing all of them to use `parking_lot`'s synchronization would be my suggestion, but again the `Cargo.toml` for `epaint` does note a minor performance impact when not using `AtomicRefCell` in a single threaded context: \r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/emilk/egui/blob/c8f6cae3624e2c1303f7d7ca0158ae3b07b8ac15/epaint/Cargo.toml#L52-L54","closed_by":{"login":"emilk","id":1148717,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNDg3MTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1148717?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/emilk","html_url":"https://github.com/emilk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emilk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emilk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emilk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emilk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emilk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emilk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emilk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emilk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emilk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/emilk/egui/issues/1379/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/emilk/egui/issues/1379/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
