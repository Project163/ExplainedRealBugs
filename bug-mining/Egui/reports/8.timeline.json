described in #576, the method `Memory::layer_id_at` expands the hit-testing region for every `Area` slightly. This is necessary so that, when the user clicks to resize a `Window`, the mouse input isn't routed to a different `Window`.\r\n\r\nFor non-resizable `Area`s (such as dropdown menus, context menus, date pickers, and any non-resizable `Window`), this causes them to be surrounded by a \"dead zone\" where any underlying widgets can't be hovered or clicked. The effect is particularly noticeable in menu bars.\r\n\r\nThis commit adds a persisted `edges_padded_for_resize` property to `Area`, which is `true` when the `Area` belongs to a resizable `Window` and `false` for all other `Area`s. The hit-testing region is only expanded when this property is `true`.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/emilk/egui/issues/3039/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/emilk/egui/issues/3039/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":11411488921,"node_id":"REFE_lADOCd2s2844uwCbzwAAAAKoLYCZ","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/emilk/egui/issues/events/11411488921","actor":{"login":"emilk","id":1148717,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNDg3MTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1148717?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/emilk","html_url":"https://github.com/emilk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emilk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emilk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emilk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emilk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emilk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emilk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emilk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emilk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emilk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"5432f91a4d764127548093017d8b6537c8321588","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/emilk/egui/commits/5432f91a4d764127548093017d8b6537c8321588","created_at":"2024-01-07T16:04:31Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
