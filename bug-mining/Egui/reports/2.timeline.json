(`0.9.0` vs `0.8.2`)\r\n\r\n    * v0.9.0: <https://crates.io/crates/xcb/0.9.0>\r\n    \r\n    * **A commit in v0.9.0 that seems it may fix issue: \"[code is generated in OUT_DIR](https://github.com/rtbo/rust-xcb/commit/026b58ef0ab928e7f01c356fc9dd4ce29bab3c51#diff-d0d98998092552a1d3259338c2c71e118a5b8343dd4703c0c7f552ada7f9cb42R51)\"**\r\n\r\n    * (Maybe also: \"[do not gen \\_\\_pycache\\_\\_ ](https://github.com/rtbo/rust-xcb/commit/8d16116665674f4f515dcc619bd294178109a1fd)\")\r\n\r\n#### `docs.rs` related aspects\r\n\r\n * The `docs.rs` help (linked in the orange build failure notice on the crate page) has a section \"[Write attempt on read-only directories](https://docs.rs/about/builds#read-only-directories)\" that mentions:\r\n\r\n    > _Most of the sandbox is a read-only file system, including the source directory of your crate and its dependencies. If your build.rs generates files that are relevant for documentation, consider writing to the _cargo output directory_, passed in the environment variable `OUT_DIR`._ \r\n\r\n * The same page also mentions in <https://docs.rs/about/builds#detecting-docsrs>:\r\n\r\n    >  _To recognize Docs.rs from build.rs files, you can test for the environment variable `DOCS_RS`, [...]  \r\n    >  This approach can be helpful if you need dependencies for building the library, but not for building the documentation._  \r\n\r\n### Potential solutions\r\n\r\nSo, it seems two options for solving/working around could be:\r\n\r\n 1. Bump version of `xcb` required to latest.\r\n 2. Detect when building docs only and/or on `DOC_RS` and skip the build step/dependency (assuming it's not required for doc generation.)\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\n[1] Key sections of the logs are:\r\n\r\n* <https://docs.rs/crate/eframe/0.8.0/builds/338677>:\r\n\r\n   * Note: The underlying error appears to be this Python error `OSError: [Errno 30] Read-only file system: '/opt/rustwide/cargo-home/registry/src/github.com-1ecc6299db9ec823/xcb-0.8.2/src/ffi/selinux.rs'` (which--somewhat confusingly--refers to a `.rs` file that is presumably the name of the `.rs` file being *generated*--not the file that is the _origin_ of the error).\r\n\r\n   * However, when that error is being handled by the Python exception handler *another* error (`Error in sys.excepthook:`) occurs due to `KeyError: 'getpwuid(): uid not found: 1001'`.\r\n\r\n   * The line number given in the traceback as `line 114, in writeout`, with code snippet `with open(path, 'w') as f:` corresponds to changes made in the commit in v0.9.0 I mentioned above.\r\n\r\n```\r\n[INFO] [stderr] error: failed to run custom build command for `xcb v0.8.2`\r\n[INFO] [stderr] \r\n[INFO] [stderr] Caused

Workaround is probably to override `rust-clipboard` dependency on `x11-clipboard` to version `0.5.1`.**\r\n\r\n### Details\r\n\r\n`cargo tree` reveals:\r\n\r\n```\r\n│   ├── egui_glium v0.8.0\r\n│   │   ├── clipboard v0.5.0\r\n│   │   │   └── x11-clipboard v0.3.3\r\n│   │   │       └── xcb v0.8.2\r\n│   │   │           ├── libc v0.2.80\r\n│   │   │           └── log v0.4.11\r\n│   │   │               └── cfg-if v0.1.10\r\n│   │   │           [build-dependencies]\r\n│   │   │           └── libc v0.2.80\r\n│   │   ├── egui v0.8.0 (*)\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhich lead to discovering:\r\n\r\n * \"[Update x11-clipboard dependency to use xcb [0.9.0] ~~0.5.1~~, fixes docs.rs builds #76](https://github.com/aweinstock314/rust-clipboard/pull/76)\"\r\n  \r\n   Which is an _unmerged PR from a year ago_ bumping `rust-clipboard`'s `x11-clipboard` dependency version to [`0.5.1`](https://crates.io/crates/x11-clipboard/0.5.1) which depends on `xcb` `0.9.0` which is seemingly fixed.","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/emilk/egui/issues/comments/776664238/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"follower","id":189962,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4OTk2Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/189962?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/follower","html_url":"https://github.com/follower","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/follower/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/follower/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/follower/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/follower/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/follower/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/follower/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/follower/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/follower/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/follower/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/emilk/egui/issues/comments/777447050","html_url":"https://github.com/emilk/egui/issues/146#issuecomment-777447050","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/emilk/egui/issues/146","id":777447050,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc3NzQ0NzA1MA==","user":{"login":"MatchaChoco010","id":20170107,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwMTcwMTA3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20170107?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MatchaChoco010","html_url":"https://github.com/MatchaChoco010","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MatchaChoco010/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MatchaChoco010/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MatchaChoco010/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MatchaChoco010/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MatchaChoco010/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MatchaChoco010/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MatchaChoco010/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MatchaChoco010/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MatchaChoco010/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-02-11T13:13:53Z","updated_at":"2021-02-11T13:13:53Z","body":"For
