8.9.21)\r\n\r\n- `ContextMenuSystem`: Stored by the Context, stores menu state across frames\r\n\r\n- `context_menu` can be called on `Response`. It checks if a context menu should be shown and takes a builder closure for the context menu's contents:\r\n```rust\r\nui.horizontal(|ui| {\r\n    ui.label(\"title:\");\r\n    ui.text_edit_singleline(title);\r\n})\r\n.response\r\n.context_menu(|ui| {\r\n    if ui.button(\"Clear..\").clicked() {\r\n        *title = String::new();\r\n        ui.close();\r\n    }\r\n});\r\n```\r\n- the `Ui` is extended to support creating and closing of menus via the `menu` and `close` methods. When `menu` is called from within a `Ui` for a menu, it creates a button with an expandable sub-menu, otherwise it creates an inline drop-down menu. Calling `close` clears the internal menu state.\r\n```rust\r\n.response\r\n.context_menu(|ui| {\r\n    if ui.button(\"Open...\").clicked() {\r\n        ui.close();\r\n    }\r\n    ui.menu(\"SubMenu\",

between context menus #577 \r\n- [x] disable hover effect on other menu items when moving towards open submenu\r\n- [x] define useful Response for `SubMenu::show`: `InnerResponse<Option<Response>>`\r\n- [x] improve styling\r\n- [x] #547 or #578\r\n- [x] optimize menu item and submenu API (~`MenuUi`~)\r\n- [x] sometimes context menus applied to panels trigger when clicking on a window covering the panel\r\n\r\n**Needs new PR**:\r\n- is the shadow of the sub-menu on the parent menu fine?\r\n- widgets still show hover visuals when cursor moves over them

I re-created this on [egui.rs](https://www.egui.rs/) (accessed 2022-12-17). When right-clicking on `Item B` (see video below, mouse pointer unfortunately not visible in the recording), a context menu with a `Remove` button as per https://github.com/emilk/egui/blob/6ae4bc486b2608212f5fc8453f5aa7e5106853f8/crates/egui_demo_lib/src/demo/drag_and_drop.rs#L135 should appear, but instead the `New Item` option appears.\r\n<!-- A clear and concise description of what the bug is.

the bug**\nMy mouse has two extra buttons: page back and forward. I have a music player built with egui that uses these buttons to go to the previous / next track. However, when my cursor is over the `ScrollArea` that contains my music library, these buttons drag-scroll the library, similarly to how primary / secondary click function.\n\n**To Reproduce**\n1. Have a mouse with additional mouse buttons. I am using a Logitech G502, but any enthusiast mouse in the last 15 years should suffice.\n2. Create a `ScrollArea` that requires scrolling (e.g. expands past the canvas), and has dragging enabled\n3. Use the extra mouse buttons. The buttons will drag-scroll the `ScrollArea`.\n\n**Expected behavior**\nThe extra buttons should not scroll the scroll area. Alternatively, this behaviour should be developer-controllable (e.g. I'd like to restrict drag-scrolling to right-click only for this application.)\n\n**Desktop (please complete the following information):**\n - OS: Windows 11\n - Version 24H2\n\n**Additional context**\nFrom a cursory inspection, drag-scrolling is controlled by\nhttps://github.com/emilk/egui/blob/226bdc4c5bbb2230fb829e01b3fcb0460e741b34/crates/egui/src/containers/scroll_area.rs#L782-L784\n\nwhich derives its should-drag state from\nhttps://github.com/emilk/egui/blob/226bdc4c5bbb2230fb829e01b3fcb0460e741b34/crates/egui/src/context.rs#L1367-L1371\n\nwith `potential_drag_id` being set by\nhttps://github.com/emilk/egui/blob/226bdc4c5bbb2230fb829e01b3fcb0460e741b34/crates/egui/src/interaction.rs#L162-L186\n\nwhich does not check for the button in use. A basic fix would be to restrict these two cases to only activate when `button` is the primary or secondary click, but the filter here would ideally be user-controllable. I'm not sure how feasible that would be, as this is decoupled from the widget logic itself.\n\n#578 appears to be related to this; the fix prevented dragging of windows with the secondary button, but the issue seems to cover draggable elements as a whole.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/emilk/egui/issues/7544/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/emilk/egui/issues/7544/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
