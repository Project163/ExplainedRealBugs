I will review you PR, but my time is limited!\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis continues the work I started in https://github.com/emilk/egui/pull/1634 by updating eframe to also defer how it initializes graphics state, which ensures that on Android we wait until the application has an associated `SurfaceView`.\r\n\r\nThe first commit (which affects the `NativeOption` API) is needed for me to use the [android-activity](https://github.com/rib/android-activity) Android glue crate with Egui which was a pre-requisite for being able to create an Android test/example using eframe. Notably; the aim here was to create a general mechanism that allows customizing the event loop so it's not necessary for Egui/EFrame to have a direct dependency on the `android-activity` glue crate (since Winit will generally handle the Android platform integration).\r\n\r\nThe minimal example [here](https://github.com/rib/android-activity/tree/eframe/examples/agdk-eframe) can be used to test this - and that will hopefully be updated soon to use demo lib.\r\n\r\nThe main issue hit while making this change was realizing that it was only really possible to support Android fully with Wgpu currently, not with Glow/Glutin.\r\n\r\nThe difficulty with Glutin is that it currently tightly couples a GL context with a window which means you can't destroy and recreate just the window surface when an Android app is suspended - you're forced to also destroy the full GL context, at which point you're basically forced to tear everything down. There is work in progress to improve the Glutin API so suspend and resume will be possible to support in the future, but I'm not sure what the eta is currently for [this work](https://github.com/rust-windowing/glutin/pull/1435).\r\n\r\nFor now though I have still updated the Glow integration in-line with the Wgpu changes - so it would be possible to launch an Glow based application on Android and it should work until the application is suspended - which is at least an incremental improvement and hopefully it will just be another incremental change to support suspend and resume once the `Surface` API lands for Glutin.\r\n\r\nCloses
