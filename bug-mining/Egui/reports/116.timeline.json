now working on a fix, that's slightly different from what I first had in mind.\n\n`winit` has a `phase` value in the `MouseWheel` event, which I can use to have egui track if we're currently scrolling. What's left now is how to handle this on web.\n\n`winit` [seems to just send the `Moved` phase on the web](https://github.com/rust-windowing/winit/blob/v0.30.12/src/platform_impl/web/event_loop/window_target.rs#L509), which we could also do. But that would mean this would still be broken on web 😕 \n\n<details>\n<summary>Logged mouse wheel events kinetic scrolling on a mac</summary>\n\nNotice the frame delay between events:\n\n```\nframe:
