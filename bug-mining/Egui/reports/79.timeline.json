read the \"Making a PR\" section of [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](https://github.com/emilk/egui/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) before opening a Pull Request!\r\n\r\n* Keep your PR:s small and focused.\r\n* The PR title is what ends up in the changelog, so make it descriptive!\r\n* If applicable, add a screenshot or gif.\r\n* If it is a non-trivial addition, consider adding a demo for it to `egui_demo_lib`, or a new example.\r\n* Do NOT open PR:s from your `master` branch, as that makes it hard for maintainers to test and add commits to your PR.\r\n* Remember to run `cargo fmt` and `cargo clippy`.\r\n* Open the PR as a draft until you have self-reviewed it and run `./scripts/check.sh`.\r\n* When you have addressed a PR comment, mark it as resolved.\r\n\r\nPlease be patient! I will review your PR, but my time is limited!\r\n-->\r\n\r\n* Closes #5053 \r\n* [x] I have followed the instructions in the PR template\r\n\r\n\r\nThis fixes #5053 by adding a Sense parameter to UiBuilder, using that in Context::create_widget, so the Widget is registered with the right Sense / focusable. Additionally, I've added a ignore_focus param to create_widget, so the focus isn't surrendered / reregistered on Ui::interact_bg. \r\n\r\nThe example from #5053 now works correctly:

response in advance, without having to know about the internals of how the Ui Ids get created.\r\n\r\nThis makes it really easy to created interactive container elements or custom buttons, without
