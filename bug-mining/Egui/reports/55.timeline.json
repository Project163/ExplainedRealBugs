works, for `ScrollArea` and this demo code. But it is a bit unpractical in reality. In the case of opening a modal window/dialog and wanting to disable everything on the main window underneath:\r\n- There is a need to add `.enable_scrolling(ui.is_enabled())` to every `ScrollArea` in the main window\r\n- For some widgets (like `egui_extras.Table` and  `egui_dock.TabViewer` and possibly others) there is no equivalent API and this is not possible.\r\n\r\nAnyway, this is low priority and only a weird behavior not a serious bug.

Summary\r\n\r\nThis PR modifies `ScrollArea` and `Plot` to disable their interactions when the UI is disabled.\r\n\r\n## Changes\r\n\r\n- Interaction with `ScrollArea` in `egui` is disabled when the UI is disabled.\r\n- Interaction with `Plot` in `egui_plot` is disabled when the UI is disabled.\r\n- These changes ensure that `ScrollArea` and `Plot` behave consistently with the rest of the UI, preventing them from responding to user input when the UI is in a disabled state.\r\n\r\n## Impact\r\n\r\nThis PR enhances the consistency of `egui`'s UI behavior by ensuring that all elements,
