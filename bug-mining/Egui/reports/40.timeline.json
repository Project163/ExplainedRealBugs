scale.","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/emilk/egui/issues/comments/1211989119/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"Barugon","id":16503728,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NTAzNzI4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16503728?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Barugon","html_url":"https://github.com/Barugon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Barugon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Barugon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Barugon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Barugon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Barugon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Barugon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Barugon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Barugon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Barugon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"actor":{"login":"coderedart","id":24411704,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NDExNzA0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24411704?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/coderedart","html_url":"https://github.com/coderedart","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coderedart/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coderedart/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coderedart/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coderedart/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coderedart/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coderedart/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coderedart/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coderedart/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coderedart/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-08-26T05:07:30Z","updated_at":"2022-08-26T05:07:30Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/SecondHalfGames/yakui/issues/54","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/SecondHalfGames/yakui","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/SecondHalfGames/yakui/issues/54/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/SecondHalfGames/yakui/issues/54/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/SecondHalfGames/yakui/issues/54/events","html_url":"https://github.com/SecondHalfGames/yakui/issues/54","id":1351752405,"node_id":"I_kwDOHmSjAM5QkhrV","number":54,"title":"Common

\r\negui often has some common complaints that pop up in different issues / discussions. I thought, i might put them somewhere so that it will help yakui can consider as features / use cases while it is still in design phase. \r\n\r\ndidn't want to unnecessarily pollute the issues section by creating multiple issues, as i don't now which of these are actually within the scope of yakui. \r\n\r\nmost of these issues have duplicates, so i am only linking to the first one that i came across.\r\n### Panning / Zooming container. \r\nhttps://github.com/emilk/egui/issues/1811\r\nscaling a particular ui object only instead of the whole UI. \r\n1. useful for node graph used in projects like blackjack\r\n2. plots / graphs\r\n3. level editors (2d platformers need to move around the level) etc..\r\n\r\n\r\n### Scrolling (variable sized items in particular)\r\nhttps://github.com/emilk/egui/issues/1376\r\n\r\n### Docking \r\nhttps://github.com/emilk/egui/issues/655\r\ndetach a tab into an individual window / area and reattach them somewhere else etc..\r\nvery useful in editor like apps. game engines, image editors, video editors.\r\n\r\n### Multi Window\r\nhttps://github.com/emilk/egui/issues/1044\r\nThis feature combines with docking where people want to undock a certain UI tab into a completely separated native window.\r\nthat would be great in these days of multi-monitor setup. kinda like GIMP.\r\nthis needs a lot of care. imgui has start work in 2017 december and it is still done completely done yet. \r\nthis *might* interact with panning - zooming containers feature too.\r\n\r\n### Accessibility\r\nhttps://github.com/emilk/egui/issues/167\r\nwe have AccessKit now and trying to be \"friendly\" to its api will help adding it eventually. \r\nThough, i think it should be optional as it brings in external system dependencies on linux.\r\nIMO, UI being keyboard friendly (or navigation friendly in general) is also helpful. So, allowing shortcuts to trigger certain actions like shifting focus to a certain widget or moving a widget etc.. are all essential.\r\n\r\n### Context being single threaded by default\r\nhttps://github.com/emilk/egui/issues/1399\r\n1. obvious performance benefits for users who don't care about multi-threading, which is most users. \r\n2. simpler api for yakui. Users can wrap it over Arc<Mutex<>> if they want multi-threading.\r\n3. avoids issues like mutex deadlocks \r\n\r\n### Context menu layout\r\nhttps://github.com/emilk/egui/issues/1176\r\nI don't think yakui will face such issues as it using a layout algorithm. but basically, context menu needs to decide in which direction it will be created (and moved)  when faced with size constraints (like right click at bottom of the window should make context menu layout towards top as it won't have enough space to fit in bottom).\r\n\r\n### Z-order of widgets / Overlapping widgets\r\nhttps://github.com/emilk/egui/issues/1516\r\nhttps://github.com/emilk/egui/issues/980\r\n\r\n### Mnemonics / Navigation features\r\nhttps://github.com/emilk/egui/issues/429\r\n\r\n### Text rendering\r\nhttps://github.com/emilk/egui/issues/56\r\nIssues with blending / gamma issues. text looking blurry or low contrast or jagged edges (anti aliasing) etc..\r\n\r\n### Modal dialogs\r\nhttps://github.com/emilk/egui/issues/686\r\nwell, i say modal dialogs inside the UI, but i also mean file dialogs like rfd. integrating them without much pain would be nice.\r\none of my favorite things that i want to see is a command pallette. like vscode's \"ctrl + shift + p\" or linux user's rofi launcher etc.. and having the command pallette on top of everything is essential to make it possible. reference https://github.com/hnOsmium0001/imgui-command-palette\r\n\r\n\r\nFinally, don't forget to add yakui to https://www.areweguiyet.com/ .

Adding a scale method is trivial, and a matrix transform is probably fine as well, with something like nalgebra.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/emilk/egui/blob/9c4f55b1f4c87362decada09dffece832eea40aa/crates/epaint/src/mesh.rs#L271-L286\r\n\r\nCalling these methods after tessellating the shapes (i.e., at the end of [this method](https://github.com/emilk/egui/blob/9c4f55b1f4c87362decada09dffece832eea40aa/crates/egui/src/context.rs#L1303)) allows us to do some interesting things.\r\n\r\n[Screencast from 2023-09-17 21-55-10.webm](https://github.com/emilk/egui/assets/43298013/4e06de4c-6c03-4361-915f-c56790ff628e)\r\n\r\nBut to use that for a pan/zoom container, the code would have to be refactored to identify which mesh/shape is in which layer, to apply the appropriate transforms only to that layer (or each shape would have to have a copy of the transform). And the pointer coordinates within the UI corresponding to the transformed layer would have to be remapped with the inverse transform, so any widget within the layer would catch the events correctly. So I guess [this method](https://github.com/emilk/egui/blob/9c4f55b1f4c87362decada09dffece832eea40aa/crates/egui/src/layers.rs#L154-L161) would have to update the transform matrix instead of applying the translation directly to the shapes within, so the same transform could be used to remap the pointer and then to translate/rotate/scale the meshes.\r\n\r\nAlso, the `clip_rect` from each shape would have to be transformed as well, somehow. But I guess if we forego rotation and arbitrary matrix transforms and focus on the translate/scale that the issue asks for, the `clip_rect` problem becomes trivial. In fact, in that case the transform could be stored in each shape as a second `Rect` (maybe called `transform_rect`), that is initially set to ((0,0), (1,1)), and is modified by each call to `translate()` or `scale()`, and then taken into account when tessellating the shape. I'll try to test that out when I have some time.","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/emilk/egui/issues/comments/1722568979/reactions","total_count":5,"+1":3,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":2,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"YgorSouza","id":43298013,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzMjk4MDEz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/43298013?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/YgorSouza","html_url":"https://github.com/YgorSouza","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YgorSouza/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YgorSouza/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YgorSouza/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YgorSouza/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YgorSouza/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YgorSouza/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YgorSouza/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YgorSouza/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YgorSouza/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/emilk/egui/issues/comments/1732315598","html_url":"https://github.com/emilk/egui/issues/1811#issuecomment-1732315598","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/emilk/egui/issues/1811","id":1732315598,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCd2s285nQQnO","user":{"login":"setzer22","id":7241990,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcyNDE5OTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7241990?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/setzer22","html_url":"https://github.com/setzer22","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/setzer22/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/setzer22/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/setzer22/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/setzer22/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/setzer22/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/setzer22/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/setzer22/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/setzer22/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/setzer22/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-09-23T13:11:10Z","updated_at":"2023-09-23T13:11:10Z","body":"@YgorSouza  That takes care of display, but you also need to consider about event handling.

@Engid :wave: \r\n\r\n> What is still missing in egui?\r\n\r\nI've been a bit out of the loop as of late, but as far as I understand, there has been no movement on the egui side. There's still no supported way to zoom or pan a UI container. The thing I have for blackjack is still the hack you can see described at the top of this post. The PR you link to helped clear some of the nasty parts in it, but the core of the implementation (two egui contexts, spoof winit events...) remains just as I described above.\r\n\r\nI am currently working on migrating the blackjack UI to a lower level architecture based on top of `epaint`. This is the solution I found that works for me, since I can benefit from the nice drawing APIs in egui as well as the wide back-end support while getting more control over how primitives are drawn.","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/emilk/egui/issues/comments/1752755055/reactions","total_count":4,"+1":4,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"setzer22","id":7241990,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcyNDE5OTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7241990?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/setzer22","html_url":"https://github.com/setzer22","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/setzer22/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/setzer22/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/setzer22/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/setzer22/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/setzer22/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/setzer22/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/setzer22/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/setzer22/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/setzer22/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":10589497051,"node_id":"MEE_lADOCd2s285NZrd5zwAAAAJ3Lubb","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/emilk/egui/issues/events/10589497051","actor":{"login":"Engid","id":12762185,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNzYyMTg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12762185?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Engid","html_url":"https://github.com/Engid","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Engid/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Engid/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Engid/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Engid/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Engid/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Engid/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Engid/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Engid/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Engid/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2023-10-09T10:33:24Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":10589497059,"node_id":"SE_lADOCd2s285NZrd5zwAAAAJ3Lubj","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/emilk/egui/issues/events/10589497059","actor":{"login":"Engid","id":12762185,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNzYyMTg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12762185?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Engid","html_url":"https://github.com/Engid","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Engid/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Engid/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Engid/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Engid/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Engid/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Engid/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Engid/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Engid/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Engid/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2023-10-09T10:33:24Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"actor":{"login":"Tweoss","id":70821802,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcwODIxODAy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/70821802?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tweoss","html_url":"https://github.com/Tweoss","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tweoss/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tweoss/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tweoss/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tweoss/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tweoss/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tweoss/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tweoss/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tweoss/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Tweoss/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-01-27T22:15:10Z","updated_at":"2024-01-27T22:15:10Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/emilk/egui/issues/3906","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/emilk/egui","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/emilk/egui/issues/3906/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/emilk/egui/issues/3906/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/emilk/egui/issues/3906/events","html_url":"https://github.com/emilk/egui/pull/3906","id":21

look if there is already a similar feature request. If there is, upvote the issue with 👍\r\n-->\r\nSince #3906 has added TSTransform which allows for scaling and zooming egui layers (awesome!), could we upgrade this transform to also allow for layer rotation?\r\n\r\n**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**\r\nIn my collaborative painting app users should be able to rotate the canvas they are working on. Due to the collaborative nature I'd also like to show ui on the canvas. \r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nContext::set_transform_layer should accept a Transform that also has a rotation component.\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\n- Write a tiny custom ui framework to render the canvas ui for my app\r\n- The hack using a secound egui context outlined here: #1811 \r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\n\r\n\r\nI tried to [make a quick proof of concept ](https://github.com/lucasmerlin/egui/tree/transform-rotation)to see how much effort this would be using glam for the transform matrix and I've got some promising results: \r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/emilk/egui/assets/8009393/c7769025-57de-4f9f-aa56-fe44272f9f19\r\n\r\nI guess using glam or some other crate is probably not possible and egui would need to either add Rotation to it's Transform struct or add it's own Matrix implementation?\r\nIf this is something that could be added to egui I would be interested in making a PR and working on this.\r\n\r\nThe biggest challenges seem to be:\r\n- Handling PaintCallback (I don't think those could be rotated?)\r\n- Handling ClipRects\r\n\r\n\r\nRelated to #2054 (individual widget rotation)\r\n\r\nEdit: Looking a bit more into how ClipRects are handled, it seems like for rotation to work properly with e.g. ScrollAreas we would need support for rotated clip rects. In egui_wgpu, ClipRects are implemented with set_scissor_rect, which wouldn't support rotation, so I'm not sure if there is a good way to do this.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/emilk/egui/issues/4130/reactions","total_count":6,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":6,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/emilk/egui/issues/4130/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
