This is so that they won't annoy the user.\r\n\r\nTo ensure not all tooltips with text in them are considered interactive, `selectable_labels` is `false` for tooltips contents by default.

PR adds `PopupCloseBehavior` to improve state of the <https://github.com/emilk/egui/issues/4607>\r\n\r\n`PopupCloseBehavior` determines when popup will be closed.\r\n- `CloseOnClick` popup will be closed if the click happens anywhere even in the popup's body\r\n- `CloseOnClickAway` popup will be closed if the click happens somewhere else but in the popup's body.\r\n\r\nIt also adds a test in the demo app which contains several popups examples.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nMy ideas about <https://github.com/emilk/egui/issues/4607> is to make every tooltip and popup a menu. So it will provide more control over popups and tooltips (you will be able to close a popup by calling something similar to the `ui.close_menu` if you need to). You won't need to manually handle it's opening. And also will allow to have multiple popups opened. That means you can have a popup inside a popup. And it will also lead to the easier creation of the popups. (should we create a tracking issue to track changes because to me it seems like a huge amount of changes to be done?)\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n- Improvements on

What\n\nPreviously, we had ui for adding component overrides, under an experimental feature everywhere except the time series view + some hardcoded ui for manipulating overrides (those that were `EntityProperties` in 0.16).\n\nThis PR removes both the component override ui and the hardcoded property ui in favor of a new overview + override ui showing all currently used values by all active visualizers + ability to add/remove visualizers.\n\nhttps://github.com/rerun-io/rerun/assets/1220815/425a9406-9eb2-4319-846b-fe0d0eee1a42\n\n---\n\nNoteworthy \"sideeffects\":\n* `ComponentUiCallback` now uses raw arrow arrays, allowing it to show fallbacks\n* kills lots'a old code :)\n* `VisualizerQueryInfo::queried` keeps now archetype component ordering instead of alphabetical (not in above video yet)\n* lots of inconsistency in our data flow are now visible\n\n---\n\nPlanned direct follow-ups:\n* allow various reset / override menus \n    * particularly important: remove override, add (single) override on multi-value\n    * Would be great to do this with a menu button, will have to be a context menu until https://github.com/emilk/egui/issues/4607 is handled\n* allow expanding to see the override/store/default/fallback stack\n    * original plan was to skip on this, but the method has all the data layed out neatly now, so might as well!\n* get the \"Add\" button integrated into the top (unless this is hard?)\n*  show better docs: https://github.com/rerun-io/rerun/issues/6556\n* Find a better name for the \"blueprint section\" below\n\n---\n\nAlso needed but not planned short term:\n* inspect multivalues\n    * we could do so for store multivalues already, but everything else we can't yet select, so let's tackle this later\n* ui polish\n\n---\n\nPart of:\n*

all the tooltip logic\n- add some way to open multiple / nested popups\n- update the menu to use `Popup` and make it work in any popup / anywhere\n- use the new structs in the existing functions and mark some of them as deprecated\n- clean up all the different helper fns on `Response` (inconsistent naming, some take &self, some self)\n  - should they talke &self or self?\n\nI also tried writing a test for popups that uses memory.everything_is_visible in the demo app but it was so chaotic that I don't think such a test has a lot of value. I'll rather write some more specific tests for the new popup.\n\n\nWe should also pay attantion that the new popup/tooltip/menu plays together nicely with the modal.

of #5713\r\n\r\n**Silently breaking changes:**\r\n- Menus now close on click by default, this is configurable via `PopupCloseBehavior`\r\n\r\n**Additional additions:**\r\n- `Button::right_text`\r\n- `StyleModifier`\r\n\r\nThis is a rewrite of the egui menus, with the following goals:\r\n- submenu buttons should work everywhere, in a popup, context menu, area, in some random Ui\r\n- remove the menu state from Ui\r\n- should work just like the previous menu\r\n- ~proper support for keyboard navigation~\r\n  - It's better now but requires further work to be perfect\r\n- support `PopupCloseBehavior`\r\n\r\n* Closes #4607 \r\n* [x] I have followed the instructions in the PR
