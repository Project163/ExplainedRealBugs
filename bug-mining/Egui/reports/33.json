Make a Bottom panel with a scroll area inside\r\n2. Add egui-wgpu Callbacks to it\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nThe item to be skipped if the viewport is outside of display.\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nhttps://github.com/automancy/automancy/blob/main/src/bin/automancy/gui/tile_selection.rs\r\n\r\n(Remove the following from the code to actually get the panic:\r\n```rs\r\n        if !ui.ctx().screen_rect().contains_rect(rect) {\r\n            continue;\r\n        }\r\n```\r\n)\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"emilk","id":1148717,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNDg3MTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1148717?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/emilk","html_url":"https://github.com/emilk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emilk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emilk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emilk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emilk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emilk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emilk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emilk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emilk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emilk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/emilk/egui/issues/3759/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/emilk/egui/issues/3759/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
