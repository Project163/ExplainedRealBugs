Only the most recently created `GlowWinitApp` renders properly. Closing that one doesn't get the others to work either, ~~and trying to create others after the event loop has already started seems to just not work~~ (actually fixed by manually sending the `Resumed` event to new windows to get them to start up, but that still causes all existing windows to turn glitchy).\r\n\r\nthis could be a decent architecture though, because it allows you to access

Closes <https://github.com/emilk/egui/issues/2875>.\r\n\r\nOne choice that I'm not really sure which I prefer is whether we should check for `window.id() == window_id` on `WindowEvent` events inside the `on_event` method or not. Since we're already exposing the `window`, the user could easily check that outside. However, when writing some example code, it ended up looking really bad and confusing. At the same time, people who will use this are probably people who have a good understanding of `winit` and GUI development in general, so maybe that's not an issue.\r\n\r\nThis gist shows how the 2 approaches would look like:\r\nhttps://gist.github.com/rockisch/c672345661dd5411f5611b7ab14faea0\r\n\r\nThis initial version of the PR has the check inside, but I could remove it if

read the \"Making a PR\" section of [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](https://github.com/emilk/egui/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) before opening a Pull Request!\r\n\r\n* Keep your PR:s small and focused.\r\n* The PR title is what ends up in the changelog, so make it descriptive!\r\n* If applicable, add a screenshot or gif.\r\n* If it is a non-trivial addition, consider adding a demo for it to `egui_demo_lib`, or a new example.\r\n* Do NOT open PR:s from your `master` branch, as that makes it hard for maintainers to test and add commits to your PR.\r\n* Remember to run `cargo fmt` and `cargo clippy`.\r\n* Open the PR as a draft until you have self-reviewed it and run `./scripts/check.sh`.\r\n* When you have addressed a PR comment, mark it as resolved.\r\n\r\nPlease be patient! I will review your PR, but my time is limited!\r\n-->\r\n\r\n* Closes #2875\r\n* Closes https://github.com/emilk/egui/pull/3340\r\n* [x] I have followed the instructions in the PR template\r\n\r\nAdds `create_native`. Similiar to `run_native` but it returns an `EframeWinitApplication` which is a `winit::ApplicationHandler`. This can be run on your own event loop. A helper fn `pump_eframe_app` is provided to pump the event loop and get the control flow state back.\r\n\r\nI have been using this approach for a few months.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/emilk/egui/issues/6750/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":1,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/emilk/egui/issues/6750/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":17452089814,"node_id":"CE_lADOCd2s285iiEf-zwAAAAQQOcHW","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/emilk/egui/issues/events/17452089814","actor":{"login":"emilk","id":1148717,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNDg3MTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1148717?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/emilk","html_url":"https://github.com/emilk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emilk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emilk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emilk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emilk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emilk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emilk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emilk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emilk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emilk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2025-04-29T10:09:24Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":17452089858,"node_id":"CE_lADOCd2s285iiEf-zwAAAAQQOcIC","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/emilk/egui/issues/events/17452089858","actor":{"login":"emilk","id":1148717,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNDg3MTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1148717?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/emilk","html_url":"https://github.com/emilk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emilk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emilk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emilk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emilk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emilk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emilk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emilk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emilk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emilk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":"c075053391448515c5516723845b1863a8156c6b","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/emilk/egui/commits/c075053391448515c5516723845b1863a8156c6b","created_at":"2025-04-29T10:09:24Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":17453546719,"node_id":"REFE_lADOCd2s285iiEf-zwAAAAQQT_zf","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/emilk/egui/issues/events/17453546719","actor":{"login":"pull[bot]","id":39814207,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90Mzk4MTQyMDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/12910?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pull%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/pull","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pull%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pull%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pull%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pull%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pull%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pull%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pull%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pull%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pull%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"c075053391448515c5516723845b1863a8156c6b","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/balrog-rust/egui/commits/c075053391448515c5516723845b1863a8156c6b","created_at":"2025-04-29T11:55:16Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":19311883165,"node_id":"REFE_lADOCd2s285iiEf-zwAAAAR_E_Od","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/emilk/egui/issues/events/19311883165","actor":{"login":"darkwater","id":1228306,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMjgzMDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1228306?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/darkwater","html_url":"https://github.com/darkwater","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/darkwater/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/darkwater/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/darkwater/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/darkwater/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/darkwater/subscriptions","organizations_url":"htt
