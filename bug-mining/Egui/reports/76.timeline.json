 I looked around a bit to familiarize myself with the story here again and I agree with your rationale & proposal! Putting send/sync egui-wgpu renderer/callbacks behind a feature flag makes perfectly sense me.\r\n\r\nPersonally, I'd be even leaning towards making it opt-in, but I know that a lot of people are struggling with the Send/Sync restriction and not a lot of folks are actually using atomics on the web so it's probably better to have it opt-out as you propose (i.e. all the same reasons wgpu has `fragile-send-sync-non-atomic-wasm` in the first place!)\r\n\r\n> You would not actively test that flag that way, of course, but I guess that'd be my weight to carry.\r\n\r\nI think there should be a `cargo check` job on ci (as part of `check_wasm` in `rust.yml`) with the right feature flag combination to ensure that this code path doesn't break at random. I figure that should catch almost all issues that would ensue from the \"web-atomics/no-web-atomics variants\" :)\r\n\r\n> Would you accept a PR that introduces such a feature and documents

Personally, I'd be even leaning towards making it opt-in\r\n\r\n@Wumpf  I've thought a bit about this while creating the actual PR, but I decided to stick with it being on by default.\r\n\r\nThe original reason, not making a breaking change, doesn't really pull I guess. egui has plenty of breaking changes here and there, thankfully usually easy to solve, as would probably be the case here.\r\n\r\nHowever it being enabled by default in here is better for discoverability, IMO. The default is to have the 'same behavior' on native and web, which makes things easier for normal users, and then when one wants to do multithreading, there is a nice compiler error in wgpu. That should point people to the wgpu flag, and hopefully they will find the respective egui-wgpu flag as well. If the feature is off by default, if people use frame, finding the corresponding flag in egui-wgpu isn't that easy, since you depended on it indirectly, and don't get a compiler error that points you to at least the start of the fix.\r\n\r\nTo that point, I'm not sure if it might be better to keep the same name as wgpu, or use the IMHO easier to understand name I gave it in my PR. For people that know their way around cargo.toml it should still be easy enough to spot, and I thought this makes it easier to understand for newcomers looking at these flags.\r\n\r\nAnd thank you for the kind words:).
