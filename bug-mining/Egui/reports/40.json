Please describe.**\r\nI work on the [egui_node_graph](https://github.com/setzer22/egui_node_graph) library, which can be used to create node-graph based applications in egui. One particular feature of these kind of applications is being able to zoom and pan the graph view, as showcased in the gif below. To this date, I don't think that's possible to implement in egui in a portable way, but I managed to make it work for a specific integration (winit + wgpu) and a bunch of hacks.\r\n\r\nI believe this can also be an interesting feature in other kinds of visualization-heavy applications: Right now there are things like the Plot view, which have this behavior available, but being able to use the full power of egui in a Zoomable / Pannable container feels like it would be the cleanest solution in many situations.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nIt would be great if egui could offer a portable solution to create some sort of container in which you can apply pan and zoom. Tentatively, the API could look something like this?:\r\n```rust\r\negui::PanZoomContainer::new(\"graph_area\")\r\n    .with_pan(current_pan)\r\n    .with_zoom(current_zoom)\r\n    .show(|ui| {\r\n        // Here, you get a `ui` disconnected from the parent, with an infinite canvas to draw on.\r\n    });\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\nThe current alternative, which is working for me but is highly non-portable and requires a bunch of patches on top of `egui`. The core idea is that I build two egui contexts, the one with the graph is rendered into a texture, and then that texture is drawn in the \"parent\" context as an egui::Image. This requires lots of messing around with the `pixels_per_point`, the offsets of the nodes and the quads that are being sent to wgpu (in the integration) in a very precise way to prevent visual glitches. I also intercept `winit` events that go into the child instance to offset mouse positions and such: Not fun at all, as one might imagine :sweat_smile: Nothing would make me happier than being able to throw away all this code.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure I know enough about egui internals to see how a *good* implementation for this might look, but I assume it's possible, since egui is doing the rasterization: It would need to make sure it scales and offsets any meshes inside the Pan/Zoom area. It should also make sure a high-resolution texture with the fonts is available, since scaling up the fonts might look blurry otherwise.\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\n![egui_zoom](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7241990/177932299-4264f0c2-b0ff-4a3d-a721-f47dbd0a4d67.gif)\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"emilk","id":1148717,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNDg3MTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1148717?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/emilk","html_url":"https://github.com/emilk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emilk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emilk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emilk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emilk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emilk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emilk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emilk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emilk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emilk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/emilk/egui/issues/1811/reactions","total_count":53,"+1":46,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":7},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/emilk/egui/issues/1811/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
