In 0.24 the code below was making the window all green (as expected) with little margin.\r\n\r\n```rust\r\nlet frame = egui::containers::Frame::none()\r\n    .fill(egui::Color32::from_rgb(180, 220, 160))\r\n    .inner_margin(egui::Margin::symmetric(20.0, 20.0));\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn 0.25 and 0.26 the same code makes it only partially green with title bar area still with its original color, which is also not properly adjusted to the title.\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/emilk/egui/assets/26147774/7beda39f-da3f-432b-bdef-052bdb93e51c)\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\nSteps to reproduce the behavior:\r\n1. Go to egui_demo_lib -> window_options.rs\r\n2. Find creation of \"demo_window_options\" window\r\n3. Make it as below:\r\n\r\n```rust\r\nuse super::View as _;\r\nlet frame = egui::containers::Frame::none() // <-- new\r\n\t.fill(egui::Color32::from_rgb(180, 220, 160)) // <-- new\r\n\t.inner_margin(egui::Margin::symmetric(20.0, 20.0)); // <-- new\r\nlet mut window = egui::Window::new(title)\r\n\t.id(egui::Id::new(\"demo_window_options\"))\r\n\t.frame(frame) // <-- new\r\n\t.resizable(resizable)\r\n\t.constrain(constrain)\r\n\t.collapsible(collapsible)\r\n\t.title_bar(title_bar)\r\n\t.scroll2(scroll2)\r\n\t.enabled(enabled);\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nJust as in 0.24 and earlier, the whole window area should be colored green with no exception for title bar.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"emilk","id":1148717,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNDg3MTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1148717?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/emilk","html_url":"https://github.com/emilk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emilk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emilk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emilk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emilk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emilk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emilk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emilk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emilk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emilk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/emilk/egui/issues/4002/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":1},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/emilk/egui/issues/4002/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
