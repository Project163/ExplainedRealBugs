\r\negui often has some common complaints that pop up in different issues / discussions. I thought, i might put them somewhere so that it will help yakui can consider as features / use cases while it is still in design phase. \r\n\r\ndidn't want to unnecessarily pollute the issues section by creating multiple issues, as i don't now which of these are actually within the scope of yakui. \r\n\r\nmost of these issues have duplicates, so i am only linking to the first one that i came across.\r\n### Panning / Zooming container. \r\nhttps://github.com/emilk/egui/issues/1811\r\nscaling a particular ui object only instead of the whole UI. \r\n1. useful for node graph used in projects like blackjack\r\n2. plots / graphs\r\n3. level editors (2d platformers need to move around the level) etc..\r\n\r\n\r\n### Scrolling (variable sized items in particular)\r\nhttps://github.com/emilk/egui/issues/1376\r\n\r\n### Docking \r\nhttps://github.com/emilk/egui/issues/655\r\ndetach a tab into an individual window / area and reattach them somewhere else etc..\r\nvery useful in editor like apps. game engines, image editors, video editors.\r\n\r\n### Multi Window\r\nhttps://github.com/emilk/egui/issues/1044\r\nThis feature combines with docking where people want to undock a certain UI tab into a completely separated native window.\r\nthat would be great in these days of multi-monitor setup. kinda like GIMP.\r\nthis needs a lot of care. imgui has start work in 2017 december and it is still done completely done yet. \r\nthis *might* interact with panning - zooming containers feature too.\r\n\r\n### Accessibility\r\nhttps://github.com/emilk/egui/issues/167\r\nwe have AccessKit now and trying to be \"friendly\" to its api will help adding it eventually. \r\nThough, i think it should be optional as it brings in external system dependencies on linux.\r\nIMO, UI being keyboard friendly (or navigation friendly in general) is also helpful. So, allowing shortcuts to trigger certain actions like shifting focus to a certain widget or moving a widget etc.. are all essential.\r\n\r\n### Context being single threaded by default\r\nhttps://github.com/emilk/egui/issues/1399\r\n1. obvious performance benefits for users who don't care about multi-threading, which is most users. \r\n2. simpler api for yakui. Users can wrap it over Arc<Mutex<>> if they want multi-threading.\r\n3. avoids issues like mutex deadlocks \r\n\r\n### Context menu layout\r\nhttps://github.com/emilk/egui/issues/1176\r\nI don't think yakui will face such issues as it using a layout algorithm. but basically, context menu needs to decide in which direction it will be created (and moved)  when faced with size constraints (like right click at bottom of the window should make context menu layout towards top as it won't have enough space to fit in bottom).\r\n\r\n### Z-order of widgets / Overlapping widgets\r\nhttps://github.com/emilk/egui/issues/1516\r\nhttps://github.com/emilk/egui/issues/980\r\n\r\n### Mnemonics / Navigation features\r\nhttps://github.com/emilk/egui/issues/429\r\n\r\n### Text rendering\r\nhttps://github.com/emilk/egui/issues/56\r\nIssues with blending / gamma issues. text looking blurry or low contrast or jagged edges (anti aliasing) etc..\r\n\r\n### Modal dialogs\r\nhttps://github.com/emilk/egui/issues/686\r\nwell, i say modal dialogs inside the UI, but i also mean file dialogs like rfd. integrating them without much pain would be nice.\r\none of my favorite things that i want to see is a command pallette. like vscode's \"ctrl + shift + p\" or linux user's rofi launcher etc.. and having the command pallette on top of everything is essential to make it possible. reference https://github.com/hnOsmium0001/imgui-command-palette\r\n\r\n\r\nFinally, don't forget to add yakui to https://www.areweguiyet.com/ .

Having Egui windows be constrained to the native os windows size is a little limiting when you want to design small popout windows and such.\r\n\r\nI tested the approach from @vivlim and it worked quite well initially. However i noticed some pretty sevier performance issues once you have multiple windows open. This happens because an update on one window causes a redraw on all the windows. This means moving a window around becomes quite stuttery the more windows are

Closes #1044\r\n\r\n---\r\n(new PR description written by @emilk)\r\n\r\n## Overview\r\nThis PR introduces the concept of `Viewports`, which on the native eframe backend corresponds to native OS windows.\r\n\r\nYou can spawn a new viewport using `Context::show_viewport` and `Cotext::show_viewport_immediate`.\r\nThese needs to be called every frame the viewport should be visible.\r\n\r\nThis is implemented by the native `eframe` backend, but not the web one.\r\n\r\n## Viewport classes\r\nThe viewports form a tree of parent-child relationships.\r\n\r\nThere are different classes of viewports.\r\n\r\n### Root vieport\r\nThe root viewport is the original viewport, and cannot be closed without closing the application.\r\n\r\n### Deferred viewports\r\nThese are created with `Context::show_viewport`.\r\nDeferred viewports take a closure that is called by the integration at a later time, perhaps multiple times.\r\nDeferred viewports are repainted independenantly of the parent viewport.\r\nThis means communication with them need to done via channels, or `Arc/Mutex`.\r\n\r\nThis is the most performant type of child viewport, though a bit more cumbersome to work with compared to immediate viewports.\r\n\r\n### Immediate viewports\r\nThese are created with `Context::show_viewport_immediate`.\r\nImmediate viewports take a `FnOnce` closure, similar to other egui functions, and is called immediately. This makes communication with them much simpler than with deferred viewports, but this simplicity comes at a cost: whenever tha parent viewports needs to be repainted, so will the child viewport, and vice versa. This means that if you have `N` viewports you are poentially doing `N` times as much CPU work. However, if all your viewports are showing animations, and thus are repainting constantly anyway, this doesn't matter.\r\n\r\nIn short: immediate viewports are simpler to use, but can waste a lot of CPU time.\r\n\r\n### Embedded viewports\r\nThese are not real, independenant viewports, but is a fallback mode for when the integration does not support real viewports. In your callback is called with `ViewportClass::Embedded` it means you need to create an `egui::Window` to wrap your ui in, which will then be embedded in the parent viewport, unable to escape it.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Using the viewports\r\nOnly one viewport is active at any one time, identified wth `Context::viewport_id`.\r\nYou can send commands to other viewports using `Context::send_viewport_command_to`.\r\n\r\nThere is an example in <https://github.com/emilk/egui/tree/master/examples/multiple_viewports/src/main.rs>.\r\n\r\n## For integrations\r\nThere are several changes relevant to integrations.\r\n\r\n* There is a [`crate::RawInput::viewport`] with information about the current viewport.\r\n* The repaint callback set by `Context::set_request_repaint_callback` now points to which viewport should be repainted.\r\n* `Context::run` now returns a list of viewports in `FullOutput` which should result in their own independant windows\r\n* There is a new `Context::set_immediate_viewport_renderer` for setting up the immediate viewport integration\r\n* If you support viewports, you need to call `Context::set_embed_viewports(false)`, or all new viewports will be embedded (the default behavior).\r\n\r\n\r\n## Future work\r\n* Make it easy to wrap child viewports in the same chrome as `egui::Window`\r\n* Automatically show embedded viewports using `egui::Window`\r\n* Use the new `ViewportBuilder` in `eframe::NativeOptions`\r\n* Automatically position new viewport windows (they currently cover each other)\r\n* Add a `Context` method for listing all existing viewports\r\n\r\nFind more at

app always work desktop or single_window because of embedding\r\n- Dear ImGui viewport system\r\n\r\n## What is a Viewport\r\n\r\nA Viewport is a egui isolated component!\r\nCan be used by the egui integration to create native windows!\r\n\r\nWhen you create a Viewport is possible that the backend do not supports that!\r\nSo you need to check if the Viewport was created or you are in the normal egui context!\r\nThis is how you can do that:\r\n```rust\r\nif ctx.viewport_id() != ctx.parent_viewport_id() {\r\n    // In here you add the code for the viewport context, like\r\n    egui::CentralPanel::default().show(ctx, |ui|{\r\n        ui.label(\"This is in a native window!\");\r\n    });\r\n}else{\r\n    // In here you add the code for when viewport cannot be created!\r\n   // You cannot use CentralPanel in here because you will override the app CentralPanel\r\n   egui::Window::new(\"Virtual Viewport\").show(ctx, |ui|{\r\n       ui.label(\"This is without a native window!\\nThis is in a embedded viewport\");\r\n   });\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis PR do not support for drag and drop between Viewports!\r\n\r\nAfter this PR is accepted i will begin work to intregrate the Viewport system in `egui::Window`!\r\nThe `egui::Window` i want to behave the same on desktop and web\r\nThe `egui::Window` will be like Godot Window\r\n\r\n## Changes and new\r\n\r\nThese are only public structs and functions!\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n<summary>\r\n\r\n## New\r\n</summary>\r\n\r\n- `egui::ViewportId`\r\n- `egui::ViewportBuilder`\r\nThis is like winit WindowBuilder\r\n\r\n- `egui::ViewportCommand`\r\nWith this you can set any winit property on a viewport, when is a native window!\r\n\r\n- `egui::Context::new`\r\n- `egui::Context::create_viewport`\r\n- `egui::Context::create_viewport_sync`\r\n- `egui::Context::viewport_id`\r\n- `egui::Context::parent_viewport_id`\r\n- `egui::Context::viewport_id_pair`\r\n-

`egui::WindowEvent`\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n<summary>\r\n\r\n## Changes\r\n</summary>\r\n\r\n- `egui::Context::run`\r\nNow needs the viewport that we want to render!\r\n\r\n- `egui::Context::begin_frame`\r\nNow needs the viewport that we want to render!\r\n\r\n- `egui::Context::tessellate`\r\nNow needs the viewport that we want to render!\r\n\r\n- `egui::FullOutput`\r\n```diff\r\n- repaint_after\r\n+ viewports\r\n+ viewport_commands\r\n```\r\n\r\n- `egui::RawInput`\r\n```diff\r\n+ inner_rect\r\n+ outer_rect\r\n```\r\n\r\n- `egui::Event`\r\n```diff\r\n+ WindowEvent\r\n```\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n### Async Viewport\r\n\r\nAsync means that is independent from other viewports!\r\n\r\nIs created by `egui::Context::create_viewport`\r\n\r\nTo be used you will need to wrap your state in `Arc<RwLock<T>>`\r\nLook at viewports example to understand how to use it!\r\n\r\n### Sync Viewport\r\n\r\nSync means that is dependent on his parent!\r\n\r\nIs created by `egui::Context::create_viewport_sync`\r\n\r\nThis will pause the parent then render itself the resumes his parent!\r\n\r\n#### :warning: This currently will make the fps/2 for every sync viewport\r\n\r\n### Common\r\n\r\n#### :warning: Attention\r\n\r\nYou will need to do this when you render your content\r\n```rust\r\nctx.create_viewport(ViewportBuilder::new(\"Simple Viewport\"), | ctx | {\r\n    let content = |ui: &mut egui::Ui|{\r\n        ui.label(\"Content\");\r\n    };\r\n\r\n    // This will make the content a popup if cannot create a native window\r\n    if ctx.viewport_id() != ctx.parent_viewport_id() {\r\n        egui::CentralPanel::default().show(ctx, content);\r\n    } else {\r\n        egui::Area::new(\"Simple Viewport\").show(ctx, |ui| {\r\n            egui::Frame::popup(ui.style()).show(ui, content);\r\n        });\r\n    };\r\n});\r\n````\r\n\r\n## What you need to know as egui user\r\n\r\n### If you are using eframe\r\n\r\nYou don't need to change anything!\r\n\r\n### If you have a manual implementation\r\n\r\nNow `egui::run` or `egui::begin` and `egui::tessellate` will need the current viewport id!\r\nYou cannot create a `ViewportId` only `ViewportId::MAIN`\r\n\r\nIf you make a single window app you will set the viewport id to be `egui::ViewportId::MAIN` or see the `examples/pure_glow`\r\nIf you want to have multiples window support look at `crates/eframe` glow or wgpu implementations!\r\n\r\n## If you want to try this\r\n\r\n- cargo run -p viewports\r\n\r\n## This before was wanted to change\r\n\r\nThis will probably be in feature PR's\r\n\r\n### egui::Window\r\n\r\nTo create a native window when embedded was set to false\r\nYou can try that in viewports example before: [78a0ae8](https://github.com/emilk/egui/pull/3172/commits/78a0ae879e68621543b9ca700ece3d9456eee8a4)\r\n\r\n### egui popups, context_menu, tooltip\r\n\r\nTo be a native window\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/emilk/egui/issues/3172/reactions","total_count":16,"+1":3,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":13,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/emilk/egui/issues/3172/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/emilk/egui/issues/comments/1724358823","html_url":"https://github.com/emilk/egui/issues/1044#issuecomment-1724358823","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/emilk/egui/issues/1044","id":1724358823,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCd2s285mx6Cn","user":{"login":"emilk","id":1148717,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNDg3MTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1148717?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/emilk","html_url":"https://github.com/emilk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emilk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emilk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emilk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emilk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emilk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emilk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emilk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emilk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emilk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-09-18T20:51:05Z","updated_at":"2023-09-18T20:51:05Z","body":"This
