the bug**\r\n\r\nWhen tabbing focus through menus, focus can not select or move past disabled items. Instead, it will unfocus and restart from the beginning.\r\n\r\nI found this mentioned in the past, but not related to menu items: https://github.com/emilk/egui/issues/732\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\n\r\nCreate menu layout like below, then:\r\n\r\n1. Tab once to focus '*'\r\n2. Tab again to focus 'File'\r\n3. Enter to expand 'File' menu\r\n4. Tab twice to select each menu item not disabled\r\n5. Tab a third time, focus goes away\r\n6. Tab a fourth time, which focuses '*' again, leaving the menu open\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\n\r\nExpected that either focus would move to disabled items (which if accesskit is enabled could inform the user of a disabled menu item) or skip over the item to the next enabled item\r\n\r\n**Screenshots**\r\n\r\nBelow is an example menu for reference.\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/emilk/egui/assets/709609/f2db613f-7460-4b26-b24c-63eb18a1c893)\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\n\r\nCan reproduce in the web version here: https://lukeworks.tech/tetanes-web\r\n\r\nNote that there seems to be a separate issue where focus highlighting doesn't work on initial page load but if you switch to another tab and then back, it does seem to highlight. Debug menu says the widget is focused, just the styling doesn't seem to apply. (this does appear fixed in 0.28.0 as far as I can tell)\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/emilk/egui/issues/4774/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/emilk/egui/issues/4774/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
