Set up an iOS Xcode project that runs an egui example. (if more details are necessary I can describe how this is done)\r\n2. Use a physical iPhone device as a run destination. (a Mac is needed for this. Alternatively you can use MacInCloud and Diawi, and then download the IPA through your iPhone)\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\n\r\nI expected the UI to show correctly (i.e. no black bar at the bottom).\r\n\r\n**Screenshots**\r\n\r\nSee https://github.com/emilk/egui/issues/3117#issuecomment-1694711382\r\n\r\n**Smartphone (please complete the following information):**\r\n - Device: iPhone 12\r\n - OS: iOS 17.0.3\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"emilk","id":1148717,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNDg3MTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1148717?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/emilk","html_url":"https://github.com/emilk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emilk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emilk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emilk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emilk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emilk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emilk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emilk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emilk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emilk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/emilk/egui/issues/3547/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/emilk/egui/issues/3547/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
