If there is, upvote the issue with 👍\r\n\r\nPlease also check if the bug is still present in latest master! Do so by adding the following lines to your Cargo.toml:\r\n\r\n\r\n[patch.crates-io]\r\negui = { git = \"https://github.com/emilk/egui\", branch = \"master\" }\r\n# if you're using eframe:\r\neframe = { git = \"https://github.com/emilk/egui\", branch = \"master\" }\r\n-->\r\n\r\n**Describe the bug**\r\nWhen dragging to scroll in a `ScrollArea`, egui applies the drag velocity if the user releases their finger/mouse button mid-drag. However, this velocity is only updated when a drag actually takes place. If the cursor decelerates quickly, no drag events will be registered because it's not moving, and the velocity of the previous drag event will be used:\r\n\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0f2928b2-720f-4360-87f2-8346971f8d91\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\nSteps to reproduce the behavior:\r\n1. Open the egui demo app\r\n2. Open a demo that lets you drag to scroll, e.g. the \"Scroll a lot of lines\" tab in the \"Scrolling\" demo, the \"Misc Demos\" window, or the \"EasyMark Editor\".\r\n3. Drag a scrollable area quickly, then decelerate your dragging movement rapidly.\r\n4. Release the mouse button and observe that the previous velocity is kept even if the cursor is currently not moving.\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nNo further scrolling should occur, as the cursor is completely still and hence has no velocity.","closed_by":{"login":"emilk","id":1148717,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNDg3MTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1148717?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/emilk","html_url":"https://github.com/emilk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emilk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emilk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emilk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emilk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emilk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emilk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emilk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emilk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emilk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/emilk/egui/issues/5174/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/emilk/egui/issues/5174/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
