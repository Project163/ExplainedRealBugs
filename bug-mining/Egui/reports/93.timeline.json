you for well documenting examples that break after the last PR. I should have had stronger wording and concerns in my PR about the stricter checks, and I agree that this scenario is common enough that something should be done to loosen the bounds further.\r\n\r\nHowever, I'm not sure this leaves anything except removing errors on unknown extensions and unknown MIMEs entirely and relying solely on magic bytes with [`image::guess_format`](https://docs.rs/image/latest/image/fn.guess_format.html).\r\n\r\nI think this is okay, since as you mentioned, this is already being done after loading some bytes as it is now. But of course now we *always* would have to load bytes before rejecting an image.\r\nThoughts on scrapping MIME/URIs detection entirely for the image crate's `image_loader` @emilk ?\r\n\r\nWe could also expand the trait to formally check for magic bytes with all loaders to allow the same weaker support checking and scrap MIME/URI on those too.","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/emilk/egui/issues/comments/2457770696/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"xangelix","id":16216097,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MjE2MDk3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16216097?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xangelix","html_url":"https://github.com/xangelix","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xangelix/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xangelix/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xangelix/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xangelix/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xangelix/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xangelix/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xangelix/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xangelix/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xangelix/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":15124170600,"node_id":"MEE_lADOCd2s286cyUBLzwAAAAOFeIdo","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/emilk/egui/issues/events/15124170600","actor":{"login":"emilk","id":1148717,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNDg3MTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1148717?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/emilk","html_url":"https://github.com/emilk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emilk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emilk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emilk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emilk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emilk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emilk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emilk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emilk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emilk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2024-11-05T17:26:46Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":15124170612,"node_id":"SE_lADOCd2s286cyUBLzwAAAAOFeId0","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/emilk/egui/issues/events/15124170612","actor":{"login":"emilk","id":1148717,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNDg3MTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1148717?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/emilk","html_url":"https://github.com/emilk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emilk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emilk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emilk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emilk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emilk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emilk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emilk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emilk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emilk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2024-11-05T17:26:46Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"actor":{"login":"xangelix","id":16216097,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MjE2MDk3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16216097?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xangelix","html_url":"https://github.com/xangelix","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xangelix/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xangelix/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xangelix/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xangelix/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xangelix/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xangelix/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xangelix/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xangelix/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xangelix/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-11-05T17:38:01Z","updated_at":"2024-11-05T17:38:01Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/emilk/egui/issues/5325","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/emilk/egui","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/emilk/egui/issues/5325/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/emilk/egui/issues/5325/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/emilk/egui/issues/5325/events","html_url":"https://github.com/emilk/egu

I've lost the source on this one, but remember either the Chromium or Firefox devs officially stating they were unwilling to merge the C library in, but suggested continuing this rust port.~~ The eventual crate being worked on to be implemented in Chromium and Firefox is https://github.com/libjxl/jxl-rs, however, `jxl-oxide` is still receiving active updates.\r\n\r\nThis is also especially interesting to implement as it allows high quality jxl support through WASM, irrespective of browser jxl support (which is poor at the moment).\r\n\r\n~~This PR is a draft until `jxl-oxide`'s v0.10 release, which adds built-in `image` crate compatibility. The other linked PRs should also come first.~~ v0.10 was released https://github.com/tirr-c/jxl-oxide/releases/tag/0.10.0\r\n\r\n### Todo/Further Considerations\r\n\r\n- [ ] https://github.com/emilk/egui/issues/5341 ~Possibly should await any further image crate support detection changes. JXL magic byte detection could be added if that is the route we want to go down.\r\n- [ ] `jxl-oxide` uses rayon optionally to speed up decode. Is it fine leaving this feature for the caller to specify in their own Cargo.toml? (similar to how the `image` crate features are currently set up)\r\n- [ ] Should this PR be expanded to include more JXL features? Or (more likely) worry about basic support for now, and do larger refactoring of image loaders in a new PR? (Multiple image formats support progressive decode)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/emilk/egui/issues/5325/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/emilk/egui/issues/5325/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/emilk/egui/issues/comments/2458169127","html_url":"https://github.com/emilk/egui/issues/5341#issuecomment-2458169127","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/emilk/egui/issues/5341","id":2458169127,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCd2s286ShK8n","user":{"login":"lucasmerlin","id":8009393,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgwMDkzOTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8009393?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasmerlin","html_url":"https://github.com/lucasmerlin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasmerlin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasmerlin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasmerlin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasmerlin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasmerlin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasmerlin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasmerlin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasmerlin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasmerlin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-11-05T21:18:18Z","updated_at":"2024-11-05T21:18:18Z","body":"> But of course now we always would have to load bytes before rejecting an image.\r\n\r\nIn my opinion that's fine trade-off, if it means loading images from an url is more likely to succeed. \r\n\r\n> We could also expand the trait to formally check for magic bytes with all loaders \r\n\r\nSince the image loaders call `Context::load_bytes` themselves, I'm not sure if we could add this as part of the trait, at least not with the current design.

Then we could pass the first couple bytes to `image::guess_format` and cancel the download if all image loaders detect a format that they don't support.\r\nUnfortunately `guess_format` documentation
