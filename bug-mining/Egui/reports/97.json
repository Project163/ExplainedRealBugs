I'm always frustrated when […] -->\nWhen an `egui::Label`'s content is truncated (due to `.wrap_mode(...)`, etc), it unconditionally shows the full text on hover. However, I would like to show different text on hover. For example:\n\n```rust\nui.label(short_message).on_hover_ui(|ui| {\n    ui.label(expensive_generate_long_message());\n});\n```\n\nThe above works, but shows two hover boxes when content is truncated.\n\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\n<!-- A clear and concise description of what you want to happen. -->\nAn API that allows disabling the automatic hover text, i.e.:\n```rust\negui::Label::new(short_message)\n    .show_full_text_when_truncated(false)\n    .ui(ui)\n    .on_hover_ui(|ui| ...);\n```\n","closed_by":{"login":"lucasmerlin","id":8009393,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgwMDkzOTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8009393?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasmerlin","html_url":"https://github.com/lucasmerlin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasmerlin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasmerlin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasmerlin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasmerlin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasmerlin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasmerlin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasmerlin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasmerlin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasmerlin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/emilk/egui/issues/5708/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/emilk/egui/issues/5708/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
