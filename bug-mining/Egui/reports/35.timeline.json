Through these efforts, I've roughly identified the reason and found a temporary way to prevent it.\r\n\r\nWhen the program is minimized, the value of ui.available_height() decreases.\r\n\r\nIn the minimized state, the value of ui.available_height() seems to range between 0.0 to 20.0, depending on where the program was launched.\r\n\r\nI tried using the method if ui.available_height() < 100.0 { return; }, but graphics still broke every few hours when restoring from a minimized state.\r\n\r\nSo,\r\n```\r\nlet mut ui_available_height = ui.available_height();\r\nif ui_available_height < 100.0 {\r\n    ui_available_height = ui_available_height.at_least(100.0);\r\n}\r\n```\r\nI created the ui_available_height value using the above method and used it, but still, the graphics broke every few hours after restoring from a minimized state.\r\n\r\nLastly, I found a method where graphics didn't break for 2-3 days upon testing.\r\n```rust\r\nfn update(&mut self, ctx: &egui::Context, frame: &mut eframe::Frame) {\r\n    ...\r\n    let mut minimized_stop_work = false;\r\n    ...\r\n    egui::CentralPanel::default().frame(panel_frame).show(ctx, |ui| {\r\n        let ui_available_height = ui.available_height();\r\n        if ui_available_height < 100.0 {\r\n            minimized_stop_work = true;\r\n        }\r\n        ...\r\n    });     // CentralPanel()\r\n    ...\r\n    if !minimized_stop_work {\r\n        ctx.request_repaint();\r\n    }\r\n}    // fn update()\r\n```\r\nBy assuming that it's in a minimized state when ui.available_height() is below 100.0, and by not executing ctx.request_repaint(); (RunMode::Continuous mode in egui_demo_app.exe), the screen doesn't break even when restoring from a minimized state in Windows for a prolonged period. I've successfully tested this for 2-3 days.\r\n\r\nThis method might temporarily prevent the screen from breaking. However, I'm looking forward to a fundamental solution provided by the egui library.\r\n\r\nThanks, emilk.\r\n","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/emilk/egui/issues/comments/1732225039/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"rustbasic","id":127506429,"node_id":"U_kgDOB5mX_Q","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/127506429?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rustbasic","html_url":"https://github.com/rustbasic","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rustbasic/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rustbasic/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rustbasic/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rustbasic/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rustbasic/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rustbasic/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rustbasic/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rustbasic/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rustbasic/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/emilk/egui/issues/comments/1732320705","html_url":"https://github.com/emilk/egui/issues/3321#issuecomment-1732320705","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/emilk/egui/issues/3321","id":1732320705,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCd2s285nQR3B","user":{"login":"emilk","id":1148717,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNDg3MTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1148717?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/emilk","html_url":"https://github.com/emilk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emilk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emilk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emilk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emilk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emilk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emilk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emilk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emilk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emilk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-09-23T13:38:41Z","updated_at":"2023-09-23T13:38:41Z","body":"Thanks for your investigation!\r\n\r\nFirst of all: your posts are easier to read if you add proper [markdown code blocks](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/working-with-advanced-formatting/creating-and-highlighting-code-blocks).\r\n\r\nYou should be able to read the minimized state with `frame.info().window_info.minimized` instead of checking for the available height.\r\n\r\nThe question is what `eframe` should do when an app is minimized.

also consider splitting `App::update` into two: one `App::tick` and one `App::ui`. `tick` would be called even when minimized, while `ui` only when non minimized (right after the call to

emilk,\r\n\r\nI would like to share the results of using egui v0.24.0 ( & v024.1 ) on Windows for the past few days.\r\nI encountered one scene where the screen broke, and the program terminated within 3 seconds.\r\nInstead of the screen breaking, when used in a minimized state for approximately 2 to 6 hours, the program often exits.\r\nHowever, this is a better outcome than the screen breaking, as when the screen breaks, the program becomes unusable, and it is difficult to terminate.\r\n\r\nIn versions prior to egui v0.23.0, the screen often remained in a broken state.\r\nWith egui v0.24.0, there were no instances where the screen continued to be in a broken state.\r\n\r\nI would like to determine if the window is in a minimized state using the winapi::um::winuser::IsIconic() function.\r\nHowever, as the HWND of the window in egui is in a private state, there is no way to know if it is in a minimized state.\r\n\r\n```rust\r\npub fn is_minimized() -> bool {\r\n\r\n    let foreground_window: *mut winapi::shared::windef::HWND__ = unsafe { winapi::um::winuser::GetForegroundWindow() };\r\n    let is_minimized: bool = unsafe { winapi::um::winuser::IsIconic(foreground_window) } != 0;\r\n\r\n    return is_minimized;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nStill assuming that the window is in a minimized state if the window size is less than 100.0,\r\nand not requesting repaint during the minimized state, the program works fine.\r\n(I have also made sure not to output other screens of the viewpoint during the minimized state.)\r\n\r\n```rust\r\nCopy code\r\nlet ui_available_height = ui.available_height();\r\nif ui_available_height < 100.0 {\r\n    minimized_stop_work = true;\r\n}\r\n\r\nif !minimized_stop_work {\r\n
