made it so popups would close unless you keep calling `keep_popup_open` each frame. In theory this is a nice improvement but it's caused [some](https://github.com/emilk/egui/pull/5847) [bugs](https://github.com/rerun-io/rerun/pull/9923) since and I'm certain more will happen if we release this in the current state. I suggest we find a better solution, or at least make it a (non-silent) breaking change so people are forced to think about it.\n","closed_by":{"login":"emilk","id":1148717,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNDg3MTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1148717?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/emilk","html_url":"https://github.com/emilk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emilk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emilk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emilk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emilk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emilk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emilk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emilk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emilk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emilk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/emilk/egui/issues/7037/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/emilk/egui/issues/7037/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
