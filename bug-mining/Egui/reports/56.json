If there is, upvote the issue with 👍\r\n\r\nPlease also check if the bug is still present in latest master! Do so by adding the following lines to your Cargo.toml:\r\n\r\n\r\n[patch.crates-io]\r\negui = { git = \"https://github.com/emilk/egui\", branch = \"master\" }\r\n# if you're using eframe:\r\neframe = { git = \"https://github.com/emilk/egui\", branch = \"master\" }\r\n-->\r\n\r\n**Describe the bug**\r\n<!-- A clear and concise description of what the bug is. An image is good, a gif or movie is better! -->\r\nThis bug is exclusive to wasm.\r\nWhen dragging a scroll bar and then leaving the browser window with the mouse makes the scrollbar \"stuck\". It will only be unstuck by clicking into the browser window again, until you click again there will also be no hover effects or any other interaction.\r\n\r\nI was able to observe and consistently product this bug on both windows and debian linux.\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\nSteps to reproduce the behavior:\r\n1. Open egui.rs\r\n2. Open any window with scrolling, for instance the scrolling demo window\r\n3. Click and hold the scroll handle\r\n4. Move your mouse outside the browser window without releasing the mouse button\r\n5. Try to interact with anything else\r\n6. After clicking the scrollbar will jump\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\n<!-- A clear and concise description of what you expected to happen. -->\r\nI would expect the scroll bar to treat the mouse leaving the window as releasing the mouse button. \r\n\r\n**Desktop (please complete the following information):**\r\nI tested this on both Debian and Ubuntu Linux as well as Windows in Firefox, Chromium and Chrome, the behavior was the same in every browser.\r\nThe problem seems to be exclusive to wasm.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\n<!-- Add any other context about the problem here. -->\r\nWhen given pointers i would definitely be willing to track down the cause of the problem. It seems to be quite deep as other draggables such as sliders inhibit similar but not as disrupting problems\r\n\r\nThanks for all your hard work and have a great day ::)","closed_by":{"login":"emilk","id":1148717,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNDg3MTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1148717?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/emilk","html_url":"https://github.com/emilk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emilk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emilk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emilk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emilk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emilk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emilk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emilk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emilk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emilk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/emilk/egui/issues/4406/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":1},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/emilk/egui/issues/4406/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
