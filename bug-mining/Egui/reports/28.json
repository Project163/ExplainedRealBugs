The underlying issue in `glow` has [since been fixed](https://github.com/grovesNL/glow/commit/edfd08e2a941f4c3db6a3ba6cf84865f7c5365ff), making `glow::Context` Send + Sync again. A test case has been added to prevent such accidental breakages in the future.\r\n\r\nTherefore this commit should be reverted to allow continued usage of egui in a multi-threaded environment.\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"emilk","id":1148717,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNDg3MTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1148717?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/emilk","html_url":"https://github.com/emilk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emilk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emilk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emilk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emilk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emilk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emilk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emilk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emilk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emilk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/emilk/egui/issues/3645/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/emilk/egui/issues/3645/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
