Please describe.**\r\nI have a search box. An action sets the keyword manually. I want to continue editing the search field, however, the cursor is at the beginning of the input.\r\nThe .cursor_at_end doesn't solve the issue, as it is not the first render.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nImplement a set_cursor_pos method for `&mut TextEdit` so that I can update the cursor before the render.\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\n1. Make it possible to own the state of TextEdit, so we can change everything.\r\n2.
