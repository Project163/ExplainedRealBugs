read the \"Making a PR\" section of [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](https://github.com/emilk/egui/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) before opening a Pull Request!\r\n\r\n* Keep your PR:s small and focused.\r\n* If applicable, add a screenshot or gif.\r\n* If it is a non-trivial addition, consider adding a demo for it to `egui_demo_lib`, or a new example.\r\n* Do NOT open PR:s from your `master` branch, as that makes it hard for maintainers to add commits to your PR.\r\n* Remember to run `cargo fmt` and `cargo cranky`.\r\n* Open the PR as a draft until you have self-reviewed it and run `./scripts/check.sh`.\r\n* When you have addressed a PR comment, mark it as resolved.\r\n\r\nPlease be patient!

This is needed so that any surrounding `ScrollArea` can bring the cursor to view, otherwise the cursor lays outside the the `ScrollArea`'s `content_ui`.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/emilk/egui/issues/3660/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/emilk/egui/issues/3660/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":15489136217,"node_id":"CE_lADOCd2s285IWP7jzwAAAAObOXZZ","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/emilk/egui/issues/events/15489136217","actor":{"login":"emilk","id":1148717,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNDg3MTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1148717?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/emilk","html_url":"https://github.com/emilk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emilk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emilk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emilk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emilk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emilk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emilk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emilk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emilk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emilk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2024-12-02T08:29:07Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":15489136241,"node_id":"CE_lADOCd2s285IWP7jzwAAAAObOXZx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/emilk/egui/issues/events/15489136241","actor":{"login":"emilk","id":1148717,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNDg3MTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1148717?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/emilk","html_url":"https://github.com/emilk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emilk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emilk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emilk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emilk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emilk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emilk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emilk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emilk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emilk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":"4f7f23ef5eddd839654799d45ba377664131a7d1","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/emilk/egui/commits/4f7f23ef5eddd839654799d45ba377664131a7d1","created_at":"2024-12-02T08:29:07Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":15494566768,"node_id":"REFE_lADOCd2s285IWP7jzwAAAAObjFNw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/emilk/egui/issues/events/15494566768","actor":{"login":"bircni","id":75789103,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc1Nzg5MTAz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/75789103?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bircni","html_url":"https://github.com/bircni","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bircni/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bircni/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bircni/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bircni/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bircni/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bircni/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bircni/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bircni/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bircni/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"4f7f23ef5eddd839654799d45ba377664131a7d1","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bircni/egui/commits/4f7f23ef5eddd839654799d45ba377664131a7d1","created_at":"2024-12-02T15:08:35Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
