menus (`Ui::menu_button`) and context menus (`Response::context_menu`) are implemented using the `egui::menu` module.\r\n\r\nThere are also tooltips (`Response::on_hover_ui` etc) and `ComboBox` popups, both implemented using `egui::containers::popup`.\r\n\r\nIt would be nice to unify these systems.\r\n\r\nThings I would like to accomplish:\r\n\r\n* Being able to open a popup on:\r\n  * hover (tooltip)\r\n  * click (menu)\r\n  * right-click or long-press (context menu)\r\n* Nest sub-menus everywhere (currently not possible in tooltips)\r\n* Call `ui.close_menu` to close a tooltip and popup (currently only works for menus)\r\n\r\nAt the same time it would be great to take a naming pass on all these things, and look up what they are commonly called in other ui libraries.","closed_by":{"login":"lucasmerlin","id":8009393,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgwMDkzOTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8009393?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasmerlin","html_url":"https://github.com/lucasmerlin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasmerlin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasmerlin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasmerlin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasmerlin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasmerlin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasmerlin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasmerlin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasmerlin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasmerlin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/emilk/egui/issues/4607/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":2},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/emilk/egui/issues/4607/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
