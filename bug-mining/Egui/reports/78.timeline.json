read the \"Making a PR\" section of [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](https://github.com/emilk/egui/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) before opening a Pull Request!\r\n\r\n* Keep your PR:s small and focused.\r\n* The PR title is what ends up in the changelog, so make it descriptive!\r\n* If applicable, add a screenshot or gif.\r\n* If it is a non-trivial addition, consider adding a demo for it to `egui_demo_lib`, or a new example.\r\n* Do NOT open PR:s from your `master` branch, as that makes it hard for maintainers to test and add commits to your PR.\r\n* Remember to run `cargo fmt` and `cargo clippy`.\r\n* Open the PR as a draft until you have self-reviewed it and run `./scripts/check.sh`.\r\n* When you have addressed a PR comment, mark it as resolved.\r\n\r\nPlease be patient!

An alternative, as described in #5121, would be to split the functionality for updating a texture's data from updating its options, so that we don't have to unconditionally update the bind group (or do something like store the options to check if they're changed).","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/emilk/egui/issues/5122/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/emilk/egui/issues/5122/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":14319022751,"node_id":"CE_lADOCd2s286W8iFtzwAAAANVevKf","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/emilk/egui/issues/events/14319022751","actor":{"login":"Wumpf","id":1220815,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMjA4MTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1220815?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Wumpf","html_url":"https://github.com/Wumpf","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Wumpf/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Wumpf/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Wumpf/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Wumpf/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Wumpf/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Wumpf/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Wumpf/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Wumpf/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Wumpf/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2024-09-19T07:16:43Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":14319022753,"node_id":"REFE_lADOCd2s286W8iFtzwAAAANVevKh","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/emilk/egui/issues/events/14319022753","actor":{"login":"Wumpf","id":1220815,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMjA4MTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1220815?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Wumpf","html_url":"https://github.com/Wumpf","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Wumpf/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Wumpf/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Wumpf/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Wumpf/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Wumpf/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Wumpf/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Wumpf/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Wumpf/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Wumpf/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"bb9e874c837e070584e355c5d54ee91c1d88c0ea","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/emilk/egui/commits/bb9e874c837e070584e355c5d54ee91c1d88c0ea","created_at":"2024-09-19T07:16:43Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":15019617322,"node_id":"REFE_lADOCd2s286W8iFtzwAAAAN_PSwq","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/emilk/egui/issues/events/15019617322","actor":{"login":"hacknus","id":33124824,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzMTI0ODI0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/33124824?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hacknus","html_url":"https://github.com/hacknus","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hacknus/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hacknus/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hacknus/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hacknus/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hacknus/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hacknus/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hacknus/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hacknus/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hacknus/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"0a96485415977022aca04cac4de133c703b8b2be","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hacknus/egui/commits/0a96485415977022aca04cac4de133c703b8b2be","created_at":"2024-10-30T22:33:52Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
