Extra tricky is when working with Pos2 in a coordinate system normalized to 0..=1. In this case, the debugging output for Pos2 formatted as `{:.1}` gives too little information. This is especially apparent when writing tests:\r\n```\r\nassertion `left == right` failed\r\n  left: [0.2 0.2]\r\n right: [0.2 0.2]\r\n```\r\nI would humbly request for the Debug trait to give at least 2 decimals of the x/y values.
