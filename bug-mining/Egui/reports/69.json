you have a list of items you want to scroll through, and each one of these items is configured to open a pop-up on hover.\r\n\r\nIt is very easy to inadvertently trigger one of these pop-ups as the mouse hovers over each item as the list is scrolling, at which point this pop-up will steal the focus from the mouse cursor and interrupt your scroll midway through, which is really not a great experience.\r\n\r\nI would like some way of making scrolling and pop-ups interact in a friendlier way.\r\n\r\n@abey79 proposed:\r\n> One avenue would be to have any scrolling action resets the tooltip timer, eg.the mouse must be (near)still AND no scrollarea should move for xxx ms. \r\n\r\nSounds good to me.","closed_by":{"login":"emilk","id":1148717,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNDg3MTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1148717?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/emilk","html_url":"https://github.com/emilk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emilk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emilk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emilk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emilk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emilk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emilk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emilk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emilk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emilk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/emilk/egui/issues/4781/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/emilk/egui/issues/4781/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
