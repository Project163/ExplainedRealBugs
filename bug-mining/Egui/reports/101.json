I think it should be true.\n\n\n**To Reproduce**\nReproducing on egui.rs was tricky but I found a way:\n\nhttps://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6274f96c-1d22-4507-8f6e-622db665b14c\n\nClicking on the tooltip doesn't close the colorpicker, if the pointer is still inside the pickers rect. I'd expect it to close no matter where the user clicked.\n\nThis also affects the `Popup`, where CloseOnClick doesn't close the popup when clicking above the source Responses rect.","closed_by":{"login":"lucasmerlin","id":8009393,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgwMDkzOTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8009393?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasmerlin","html_url":"https://github.com/lucasmerlin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasmerlin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasmerlin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasmerlin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasmerlin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasmerlin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasmerlin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasmerlin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasmerlin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasmerlin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/emilk/egui/issues/5794/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/emilk/egui/issues/5794/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
