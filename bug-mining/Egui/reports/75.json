Please describe.**\r\nImmediate mode UI is not very flexible when it comes to code flow structure. Different parts of the application can't just register their widgets - they have to add their code as part of the main loop. With Rust borrow checking this gets tricky, because you need to use a `&mut Ui` which has a lifetime so you can't just pass it around - not unless the application flow framework explicitly supports it.\r\n\r\negui already has way around this - [`Frame::begin`](https://docs.rs/egui/latest/egui/containers/struct.Frame.html#method.begin). It returns a `Prepared` struct which stores a self owned `Ui` object with no strings attached.\r\n\r\nThe problem is that `Prepared` is not exposed. It's `pub`, but the module that owns it - `frame` - is private, and the only thing the parent module `containers` exposes from it is `Frame`.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nEither add `frame::Prepared` to the `pub use` block in `src/egui/containers/mod.rs` - or `pub use` the entire `frame` module.\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\nI've managed to hack around this: https://github.com/idanarye/bevy-yoleck/blob/d39936ce990821eb91daeb978f30b18ea98da131/src/dynamic_source_handling.rs#L143-L154. I've created a dummy `Ui` and used `mem::replace` so switch it with the one inside the `Prepared`, Indiana Jones style. Then I send the `Ui` I took from the `Prepared` around the get filled - something that I can do because `Ui` is exposed - and finish by placing that `Ui` back inside the `Prepared`.\r\n\r\nThis is a hack, and I'd rather have a proper way to do this. Theoretically I could have just used `child_ui` to create a real `Ui`, but then I'd have to calculate `max_rect` myself instead of having the `Frame` do it for me.","closed_by":{"login":"emilk","id":1148717,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNDg3MTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1148717?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/emilk","html_url":"https://github.com/emilk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emilk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emilk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emilk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emilk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emilk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emilk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emilk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emilk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emilk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/emilk/egui/issues/2106/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/emilk/egui/issues/2106/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
