EventResult::Exit\r\n            }\r\n```\r\nhas no effect on the issue, or app behaviour for me.\r\n\r\nI'm taking a flying guess here and suspecting that the root cause of my issue is in the order of operations perhaps - where `control_flow` is being set, and the event loop in winit is doing stuff before we tick back over to the start and reach `winit::event::Event::LoopDestroyed`.\r\n\r\nI'll do a

the bug**\nThere is bug with eframe where the application window remains open and cannot be closed while the program is running. If the previous window is left in this state for too long, the program is reported as not responding, even though code execution that does not involve the GUI still continues.\n\nThe application window is removed when the entire program exits.\nAlternatively, calling the \"run_native\" method replaces the previous window with a new one.\n\n**To Reproduce**\nSteps to reproduce the behavior:\n1. Clone the repository that demonstrates the issue: https://github.com/tye-exe/egui_no_close .\n2. Run the application with `cargo run`.\n3. Attempt to close the window by clicking the \"x\" button.\n4. The window will remain open.\n\n(The example program must be stopped via \"Ctrl+C\")\n\n**Expected behavior**\nThere should be no eframe window open after it is closed.\n\n**Video Example**\n[See here](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/424882dc-7ec6-4b8b-aa63-6a497622880f) (window is replaced via calling \"run_native\").\n\n**Desktop:**\n - OS: NixOS 24.11 (to reproduce entire system

This is a new behavior introduced in this PR.\r\nIf `false`, the app will close once the eframe window is closed. The is the old behavior.\r\n\r\nThis is `true` by default, and the `false` option is only there so we can revert if we find any bugs.\r\n\r\nWhen `true`, [`winit::platform::run_return::EventLoopExtRunReturn::run_return`](https://docs.rs/winit/latest/winit/platform/run_return/trait.EventLoopExtRunReturn.html#tymethod.run_return) is used. The winit docs warns of its usage, recommending `EventLoop::run`, but 🤷 \r\nWhen `false`, [`winit::event_loop::EventLoop::run`](https://docs.rs/winit/latest/winit/event_loop/struct.EventLoop.html#method.run) is used.\r\n\r\nThis is a really useful feature. You can now use `eframe` to quickly open up a window and show some data or options, and then continue your program after the `eframe` window is closed\r\n\r\nMy previous attempt at this caused some problems, but my new attempt seems to be working much better, at least on my Mac.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/emilk/egui/issues/1889/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/emilk/egui/issues/1889/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
