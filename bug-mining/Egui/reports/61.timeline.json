If I remove this condition, it works as intended. I don't know why it is written this way, and both the code above and the `scroll_with_delta` method are untouched for almost a year. I also tested with the commit that originally introduced the method (676ff047e9c), and it didn't work there either. If there is no other reason for the `&& ui.rect_contains_pointer(outer_rect)` condition, I supposed it could just be removed and the method will be fixed. But I'll wait to see if anyone has anything to say about it, and do some tests to see if it breaks anything else.\r\n\r\nI suspect that since the `scroll_delta` is set in the Context, and is therefore global to the whole UI, the idea is that if there is more than one scroll area, the one that is hovered by the mouse would be the one to use the delta. But I guess if you set it from within the show() method of the scroll area that you want to manipulate, that will not be a problem. But I'm not sure I fully understand how this is supposed to work.\r\n\r\nEdit: actually, the `&& ui.rect_contains_pointer(outer_rect)` is needed because this `scroll_delta` value is also set by the scrolling events. If we remove it, scrolling with the mouse wheel is going to affect the first scroll area that is drawn on that frame, regardless of where the pointer is. So that is not an option. I guess we have to separate the two functionalities somehow, so that the input-based scroll uses the pointer position to determine which scroll area is concerned, but the programmatic scroll affects the next scroll area to be drawn after the `scroll_with_delta` call.","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/emilk/egui/issues/comments/1454906172/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"YgorSouza","id":43298013,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzMjk4MDEz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/43298013?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/YgorSouza","html_url":"https://github.com/YgorSouza","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YgorSouza/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YgorSouza/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YgorSouza/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YgorSouza/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YgorSouza/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YgorSouza/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YgorSouza/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YgorSouza/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YgorSouza/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"actor":{"login":"lucasmerlin","id":8009393,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgwMDkzOTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8009393?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasmerlin","html_url":"https://github.com/lucasmerlin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasmerlin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasmerlin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasmerlin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasmerlin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasmerlin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasmerlin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasmerlin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasmerlin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lucasmerlin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-03-31T22:11:55Z","updated_at":"2024-03-31T22:11:55Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/emilk/egui/issues/4295","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/emilk/egui","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/emilk/egui/issues/4295/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/emilk/egui/issues/4295/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/emilk/egui/issues/4295/events","html_url":"https://github.com/emilk/egui/issues/4295","id":2217221672,"node_id":"I_kwDOCd2s286EKB4o","number":4295,"title":"Add

look if there is already a similar feature request. If there is, upvote the issue with 👍\r\n-->\r\nEgui should allow specifying whether scrolling in a ScrollArea should be animated (and also allow changing the animation duration, although that is not important for my problem)\r\n\r\n**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**\r\n<!-- A clear and concise description of what the problem is. Ex. I'm always frustrated when […] -->\r\n\r\nAfter #4119 scrolling to a certain offset is always animated, this breaks egui_virtual_list, which relied on scroll_to_rect to instantly update the scroll position. This is necessary when the user scrolls up in a infinite scroll list that loads at the top and new content is added at the top (the scroll position is offset by the height of the new content). If the scroll is animated here, the list unexpectedly jumps for the user.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nMaybe add an additional parameter to the scroll functions, a bool or maybe a enum like \r\n\r\n```rust\r\nenum ScrollAnimation {\r\n    None,\r\n    Default,\r\n    Custom(Duration, Easing),\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nI also saw a [TODO comment](https://github.com/emilk/egui/blob/3ee4890b9433e8038de4cb498a3a9d09eb0d0c4b/crates/egui/src/containers/scroll_area.rs#L813) saying this should be made configurable via Style, but that would cause an issue for my crate, if I set the scroll animation duration to zero the user might override this at a later point causing the infinite scroll to break. The user could work around this by only updating the style if scroll_to_* is actually called but this wouldn't be ideal. \r\nMaybe there could be e.g. a scroll_to_rect() with the current signature which uses the value from Style and an additional funciton like scroll_to_rect_animated() that takes the enum from above as an additional argument. \r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\nMy problem could also be solved by #2783, which would allow me to use scroll_with_delta, which curiously doesn't seem to have an animation (I'm not sure if this is intentional). But due to #2783, scroll_with_delta doesn't work reliably for me.
