Have a long scrollbar.\r\n2. Drag from the end of the scrollbar handle in a direction orthogonal to the scrollbar direction (so horizontal for a vertical scrollbar).\r\n3. Once the mouse moves even slightly outside the scrollbar handle the handle will snap so that the mouse is at the center of the scrollbar handle.\r\n\r\nThis leads to very jarring movements since while dragging a scrollbar you often move the mouse slightly outside the scrollbar handle. The issue also happens if you move the mouse quickly even in the same direction as the scrollbar.","closed_by":{"login":"emilk","id":1148717,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNDg3MTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1148717?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/emilk","html_url":"https://github.com/emilk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emilk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emilk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emilk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emilk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emilk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emilk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emilk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emilk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emilk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/emilk/egui/issues/57/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/emilk/egui/issues/57/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
