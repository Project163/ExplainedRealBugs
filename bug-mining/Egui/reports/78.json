If there is, upvote the issue with 👍\r\n\r\nPlease also check if the bug is still present in latest master! Do so by adding the following lines to your Cargo.toml:\r\n\r\n\r\n[patch.crates-io]\r\negui = { git = \"https://github.com/emilk/egui\", branch = \"master\" }\r\n# if you're using eframe:\r\neframe = { git = \"https://github.com/emilk/egui\", branch = \"master\" }\r\n-->\r\n\r\n**Describe the bug**\r\n\r\nWhen using `set_partial` to update a texture, you provide a `TextureOptions` as the third argument. In the `egui_glow` backend, these options are applied to the texture. However, in `egui_wgpu`, they are ignored entirely, and are only updated when you use `set` to *fully* replace the texture.\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\nSteps to reproduce the behavior:\r\n1. Call `ctx.load_texture` with a new `ColorImage` and some `TextureOptions`\r\n2. Call `set_partial` on the returned `TextureHandle` with some different `TextureOptions` (e.g. switch from linear to nearest-neighbor interpolation)\r\n3. Render the texture via an `Image` widget\r\n4. If you're using the `glow` backend, it'll appear using the new `TextureOptions` passed via `set_partial`. If you're using the `wgpu` backend, it'll appear using the original `TextureOptions` passed via `load_texture`.\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nCalling `set_partial` should update the `TextureOptions` in both cases. Alternatively, it could be separated into different functions for updating the texture data and the texture options.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"Wumpf","id":1220815,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMjA4MTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1220815?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Wumpf","html_url":"https://github.com/Wumpf","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Wumpf/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Wumpf/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Wumpf/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Wumpf/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Wumpf/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Wumpf/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Wumpf/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Wumpf/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Wumpf/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/emilk/egui/issues/5121/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/emilk/egui/issues/5121/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
