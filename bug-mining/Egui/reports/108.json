If there is, upvote the issue with 👍\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**\r\nI want my program to have 2 separate `winit` windows, one with an `egui` interface managed by `eframe` and another managed by myself. Currently, this is not possible with `eframe` because the only API to start a window is `run_native`, which internally creates an event loop, and only 1 event loop can exist on a thread afaik.\r\n\r\nFor now, I am managing the `egui` window by myself using `egui_winit` and `egui_wgpu`, but there are a lot of caveats I need to take care (paint intervals, custom handling of specific events, etc), and if I wanted to integrate with `epi` it would take even more work.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nIt would be great if `eframe` could implement:\r\n1. A way to initialize `eframe` through a different `run` method, perhaps `run_native_ex`, `run_native_custom`, `run_native_managed`, etc, which returns some kind of structure.\r\n2. An `on_event` method on said structure that returns the currently internal `Result<EventResult>` result struct + enum, so users can manage `control_flow` on their own.\r\n3. A `paint` method on said structure that paints stuff to the screen.\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\nCould also be solved if you could have 2 event loops on the same thread. I'm not that knowledgeable on `winit`'s internals, so not sure if that's possible on their part (since it's currently not allowed, I'm guessing it's not).\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"emilk","id":1148717,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNDg3MTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1148717?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/emilk","html_url":"https://github.com/emilk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emilk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emilk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emilk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emilk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emilk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emilk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emilk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emilk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emilk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/emilk/egui/issues/2875/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/emilk/egui/issues/2875/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
