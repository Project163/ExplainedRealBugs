adds modal dialogs as described in [issue 686](https://github.com/emilk/egui/issues/686), closely following the way  `popups` are implemented.\r\n\r\n##### The modal dialog:\r\n- Is shown with a function and stores the bare minimum state info in the ui context,\r\n- Enforces a user-interface mode by intercepting clicks/interactions, preventing the user from interacting with the covered ui. (See [Modal & Nonmodal Dialogs: When (& When Not) to Use Them](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/modal-nonmodal-dialog/)),\r\n- Enforces a logical mode: Whichever id first claims the modal \"owns\" it, and another id cannot be used to show a modal without relinquishing control established by the first (Relinquishing control doesn't require id, just an empty function call). This prevents a modal from inadvertently being dismissed by another modal, which could confuse application flows,\r\n- Lets the user customize the modal interceptor background color/transparency,\r\n- Makes the user is wholly responsible for the ui shown in the modal, and\r\n- Supports the modal being optionally closed using keyboard keys (as shown in the example).\r\n\r\n##### Screen cap showing modal interception of ui senses \r\n\r\n![egui_modal](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60540983/138622021-357e77ab-526a-41a6-bd30-1a2a5b3c5da4.gif)\r\n---\r\n##### Possible Problems / Needs improvement \r\n- Implementation: Content in the modal is shown in an Area. Using an Area inside the modal ui requires that the inner Area be set to Order::Foreground so it shows up on top of the modal interceptor. This may not be intuitive.\r\n- Usability: It would have been nice wanted to be able to give the user the option to click away from the modal and close it, but that required making set-in-stone decisions about the ui and complicating the function call. The implementer ought still be able to provide this functionality, however. \r\n- Aesthetic: This doesn't make any decisions about aesthetic, so by default, it's not an exact match for the general egui look. It was thought that a broader approach could serve a lot of different purposes, such as showing error messages or character overlays like in RPG-style games, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\n##### In addition to the above, this PR:\r\n- [x] Adds a line to the relevant `CHANGELOG.md` under \"Unreleased\".\r\n- [x] Has some example code (doc-tests)\r\n- [x] Has a demo for it in`egui_demo_lib`.\r\n- [x] Assuages the savage `sh/check.sh`.\r\n- [ ] When you have addressed a PR comment, mark it as resolved. (Unsure if some requirement was left unsatisfied, so leaving this for now)\r\n\r\nCloses <https://github.com/emilk/egui/issues/686>.\r\n\r\nGive a shout if anything is wrong here.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/emilk/egui/issues/839/reactions","total_count":10,"+1":7,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":3},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/emilk/egui/issues/839/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":5837468538,"node_id":"LE_lADOCd2s2846o9MSzwAAAAFb8LN6","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/emilk/egui/issues/events/5837468538","actor":{"login":"emilk","id":1148717,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNDg3MTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1148717?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/emilk","html_url":"https://github.com/emilk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emilk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emilk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emilk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emilk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emilk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emilk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emilk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emilk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emilk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-01-03T22:44:16Z","label":{"name":"design","color":"89e59c"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"actor":{"login":"coderedart","id":24411704,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NDExNzA0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24411704?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/coderedart","html_url":"https://github.com/coderedart","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coderedart/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coderedart/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coderedart/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coderedart/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coderedart/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coderedart/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coderedart/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coderedart/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/coderedart/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-08-26T05:07:30Z","updated_at":"2022-08-26T05:07:30Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/SecondHalfGames/yakui/issues/54","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/SecondHalfGames/yakui","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/SecondHalfGames/yakui/issues/54/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/SecondHalfGames/yakui/issues/54/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/SecondHalfGames/yakui/issues/54/events","html_url":"https://github.com/SecondHalfGames/yakui/issues/54","id":1351752405,"node_id":"I_kwDOHmSjAM5QkhrV","number":54,"title":"Common

I thought, i might put them somewhere so that it will help yakui can consider as features / use cases while it is still in design phase. \r\n\r\ndidn't want to unnecessarily pollute the issues section by creating multiple issues, as i don't now which of these are actually within the scope of yakui. \r\n\r\nmost of these issues have duplicates, so i am only linking to the first one that i came across.\r\n### Panning / Zooming container. \r\nhttps://github.com/emilk/egui/issues/1811\r\nscaling a particular ui object only instead of the whole UI. \r\n1. useful for node graph used in projects like blackjack\r\n2. plots / graphs\r\n3. level editors (2d platformers need to move around the level) etc..\r\n\r\n\r\n### Scrolling (variable sized items in particular)\r\nhttps://github.com/emilk/egui/issues/1376\r\n\r\n### Docking \r\nhttps://github.com/emilk/egui/issues/655\r\ndetach a tab into an individual window / area and reattach them somewhere else etc..\r\nvery useful in editor like apps. game engines, image editors, video editors.\r\n\r\n### Multi Window\r\nhttps://github.com/emilk/egui/issues/1044\r\nThis feature combines with docking where people want to undock a certain UI tab into a completely separated native window.\r\nthat would be great in these days of multi-monitor setup. kinda like GIMP.\r\nthis needs a lot of care. imgui has start work in 2017 december and it is still done completely done yet. \r\nthis *might* interact with panning - zooming containers feature too.\r\n\r\n### Accessibility\r\nhttps://github.com/emilk/egui/issues/167\r\nwe have AccessKit now and trying to be \"friendly\" to its api will help adding it eventually. \r\nThough, i think it should be optional as it brings in external system dependencies on linux.\r\nIMO, UI being keyboard friendly (or navigation friendly in general) is also helpful. So, allowing shortcuts to trigger certain actions like shifting focus to a certain widget or moving a widget etc.. are all essential.\r\n\r\n### Context being single threaded by default\r\nhttps://github.com/emilk/egui/issues/1399\r\n1. obvious performance benefits for users who don't care about multi-threading, which is most users. \r\n2. simpler api for yakui. Users can wrap it over Arc<Mutex<>> if they want multi-threading.\r\n3. avoids issues like mutex deadlocks \r\n\r\n### Context menu layout\r\nhttps://github.com/emilk/egui/issues/1176\r\nI don't think yakui will face such issues as it using a layout algorithm. but basically, context menu needs to decide in which direction it will be created (and moved)  when faced with size constraints (like right click at bottom of the window should make context menu layout towards top as it won't have enough space to fit in bottom).\r\n\r\n### Z-order of widgets / Overlapping widgets\r\nhttps://github.com/emilk/egui/issues/1516\r\nhttps://github.com/emilk/egui/issues/980\r\n\r\n### Mnemonics / Navigation features\r\nhttps://github.com/emilk/egui/issues/429\r\n\r\n### Text rendering\r\nhttps://github.com/emilk/egui/issues/56\r\nIssues with blending / gamma issues. text looking blurry or low contrast or jagged edges (anti aliasing) etc..\r\n\r\n### Modal dialogs\r\nhttps://github.com/emilk/egui/issues/686\r\nwell, i say modal dialogs inside the UI, but i also mean file dialogs like rfd. integrating them without much pain would be nice.\r\none of my favorite things that i want to see is a command pallette. like vscode's \"ctrl + shift + p\" or linux user's rofi launcher etc.. and having the command pallette on top of everything is essential to make it possible. reference https://github.com/hnOsmium0001/imgui-command-palette\r\n\r\n\r\nFinally, don't forget to add yakui to https://www.areweguiyet.com/ .

This PR abstracts the modal creation code into a dedicated feature in `re_ui`, and use that abstraction for the space view entity picker.\r\n\r\nThe new `re_ui::modal` has support for two aspects of modal window management:\r\n- The modal window itself (`re_ui::modal::Modal`), which handles dimming the background, a close button, and exiting with ESC and/or clicking outside of the window.\r\n- The handling of the modal window (`re_ui::modal::ModalHandler`). The `Modal` struct should be kept only while the modal is actually shown, so it's typically held in and `Option<Modal>`. `ModalHandler` implements the house keeping of populating the `Option` when the modal must be displayed, and dropping it when the modal is closed.\r\n\r\n**Note**: with this PR, the modals are now properly centred, although erroneous centring behaviour might happen that require deleting your `app.ron`. This will eventually be fixed with a new egui release that includes https://github.com/emilk/egui/pull/3721\r\n\r\nUsage:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"583\" alt=\"image\"

Closes #686 \r\n* Closes #839 \r\n* #5370 should be merged before this\r\n* [x] I have followed the instructions in the PR template\r\n\r\nThis adds modals to egui. \r\nThis PR\r\n- adds a new `Modal` struct\r\n- adds `Memory::set_modal_layer` to limit focus to a layer and above (used by the modal struct, but could also be used by custom modal implementations)\r\n- adds `Memory::allows_interaction` to check if a layer is behind a modal layer, deprecating `Layer::allows_interaction`\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCurrent problems:\r\n- ~When a button is focused before the modal opens, it stays focused and you also can't hit tab to focus the next widget. Seems like focus is \"stuck\" on that widget until you hit escape. This might be related to https://github.com/emilk/egui/issues/5359~ fixed!\r\n\r\nPossible future improvements: \r\n- The titlebar from `window` should be made into a separate widget and added to the modal\r\n- The state whether the modal is open should be stored in egui (optionally), similar to popup and menu. Ideally before this we would refactor popup state to unify popup and menu
