So far, verbosity levels have been relatively loosely defined: small, reduced, full. While flexible, this approach has two problems:\r\n- It provides very little guidance for `DataUi` implementors on how to deal with each verbosity level.\r\n- It provides callers very little guarantees on the kind of UI that might end up being generated for a given verbosity level.\r\n\r\nConcretely, this makes some efforts difficult.\r\n\r\nFor example, #4161 requires all implementation for `UiVerbosity::Small` to fit inside half a list item, whereas some implementation actually span multiple lines.\r\n\r\nLikewise, using full-span widgets such as list item in `DataUi` is complicated because it's currently ill-defined whether a give verbosity level implies that a `full_span_scope` is defined or not (https://github.com/rerun-io/rerun/issues/6246).\r\n\r\nA very partial attempt at resolving this was included in #4416, where distinct verbosity level were created specifically for single-selection vs. multi-selection Selection Panel.\r\n\r\n### Current use of `UiVerbosity`\r\n\r\n- `UiVerbosity::Small`:\r\n  - `InstancePath::data_ui()` delegating to component's `data_ui()`\r\n  - `EntityLatestAtResults::data_ui()` delegating to component's `data_ui()`\r\n  - `override_ui()` delegating to component's `data_ui()`\r\n  - `DataFrame` space view, for displaying component in the table\r\n  - `image_hover_ui` delegating to `TensorData::data_ui()`\r\n- `UiVerbosity::Reduced`: used in many places, but always as part of some hover tooltip\r\n- `UiVerbosity::LimitHeight` and `UiVerbosity::Full`: only used by the selection panel\r\n\r\n### Propsal\r\n\r\n- [ ] Rename `UiVerbosity` to `UiLayout` and change the variants to more closely capture the context and/or constraints they should respect: #6291\r\n  - `Small` -> `List`\r\n    - used within a `ListItem`\r\n    - single line, short, capable of truncation\r\n      - https://github.com/emilk/egui/issues/4473 \r\n    - `full_span_scope` not defined\r\n  - `Reduced` -> `Tooltip`\r\n    - used within a tooltip\r\n    - no interactive UI, for now no full-span UI because of https://github.com/rerun-io/rerun/issues/6246)\r\n    - `full_span_scope` not defined\r\n  - `LimitHeight` -> `SelectionPanelLimitHeight`\r\n    - used in selection panel with multi-selection\r\n    - very long list should be in height-limited scroll area\r\n    - `full_span_scope` defined\r\n  - `Full` -> `SelectionPanelFull`\r\n    - used in selection panel with single selection\r\n    - very long list may be unrolled as it will be enclosed in a scroll area\r\n    - `full_span_scope` defined\r\n- [x] Create a release checklist test that extensively logs all possible components, such that it's easier to review all `DataUi` implementations.\r\n  - https://github.com/rerun-io/rerun/pull/6267\r\n- [ ] Fix all current implementations such that they obey the constraints above\r\n\r\n### Related\r\n\r\n- #4161\r\n- #4416\r\n- https://github.com/rerun-io/rerun/pull/6248\r\n-

Closes #4473\r\n\r\nThis PR introduce `Style::wrap_mode`, which adds support for text truncation in addition to text wrapping. This PR also update some width calculation of the ComboBox.\r\n\r\n#### Core\r\n\r\n- Add `egui::TextWrapMode` (pure enum with `Extend`, `Wrap`, `Truncate`)\r\n- Add `Style::wrap_mode: Option<tTextWrapMode>`\r\n- **DEPRECATED**: `Style::wrap`, use `Style::wrap_mode` instead.\r\n- Add `Ui::wrap_mode()` to return the wrap mode to use in the current ui. If specified in `Style`, return it. Otherwise, return `TextWrapMode::Wrap` for vertical layout and wrapping horizontal layout, and `TextWrapMode::Extend` otherwise.\r\n- **DEPRECATED**: `Ui::wrap_text()`, use `Ui::wrap_mode` instead.\r\n\r\n#### Widget\r\n\r\n- Update the width calculation of the `ComboBox` button (_not_ its popup menu).\r\n  - Now, `ComboBox::width()` (defaulting to `Spacing::combo_width`) is always considered a minimum width and will extend the `Ui`, regardless of the selected text width and wrap mode.\r\n  - Introduce `ComboBox::wrap_mode`, which overrides `Ui::wrap_mode` for the selected text layout.\r\n    - Note: since `ComboBox` uses `ui.horizontal` internally, the default wrap mode is always `TextWrapMode::Extend`, regardless of the caller's `Ui`'s layout.\r\n  - The `ComboBox` button no longer extend to `ui.available_width()` with wrapping is enabled.\r\n  - **BREAKING**: `ComboBox::wrap()` no longer has a `bool` argument and is now a short-hand for `ComboBox::wrap_mode(TextWrapMode::Wrap)`.\r\n  - Added `ComboBox::truncate()` as short-hand for `ComboBox::wrap_mode(TextWrapMode::Truncate)`.\r\n- Update `Label`\r\n  - Add `Label::wrap_mode()` to specify the text wrap mode.\r\n  - **BREAKING**:  `Label::wrap()` no longer has a `bool` argument and is now a short-hand for `Label::wrap_mode(TextWrapMode::Wrap)`.\r\n  - **BREAKING**:  `Label::truncate()` no longer has a `bool` argument and is now a short-hand for `Label::wrap_mode(TextWrapMode::Truncate)`.\r\n- Update `Button`\r\n  - Add `Button::wrap_mode()` to specify the text wrap mode.\r\n  - **BREAKING**:  `Button::wrap()` no longer has a `bool` argument and is now a short-hand for `Button::wrap_mode(TextWrapMode::Wrap)`.\r\n  - Added `Button::truncate()` as short-hand for `Button::wrap_mode(TextWrapMode::Truncate)`.\r\n\r\n#### Low-level\r\n\r\n- **BREAKING**: `WidgetText::into_galley()` now takes an `Option<TextWrapMode>` instead of a `Option<bool>` argument.\r\n- **BREAKING**: `WidgetText::into_galley_impl(()` now takes a `TextWrapping` argument instead of `wrap: bool` and `availalbe_width: f32` arguments.\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/emilk/egui/issues/4556/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/emilk/egui/issues/4556/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":12955868290,"node_id":"CE_lADOCd2s286ID1gUzwAAAAMEOtyC","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/emilk/egui/issues/events/12955868290","actor":{"login":"abey79","id":49431240,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5NDMxMjQw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/49431240?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/abey79","html_url":"https://github.com/abey79","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abey79/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abey79/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abey79/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abey79/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abey79/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abey79/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abey79/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abey79/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abey79/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2024-05-28T11:10:43Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":12955868325,"node_id":"REFE_lADOCd2s286ID1gUzwAAAAMEOtyl","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/emilk/egui/issues/events/12955868325","actor":{"login":"abey79","id":49431240,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5NDMxMjQw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/49431240?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/abey79","html_url":"https://github.com/abey79","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abey79/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abey79/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abey79/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abey79/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abey79/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abey79/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abey79/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abey79/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abey79/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"bcd91f27a12530e42c73828a1520f74444a4a516","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/emilk/egui/commits/bcd91f27a12530e42c73828a1520f74444a4a516","created_at":"2024-05-28T11:10:43Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":15019612928,"node_id":"REFE_lADOCd2s286ID1gUzwAAAAN_PRsA","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/emilk/egui/issues/events/15019612928","actor":{"login":"hacknus","id":33124824,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzMTI0ODI0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/33124824?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hacknus","html_url":"https://github.com/hacknus","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hacknus/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hacknus/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hacknus/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hacknus/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hacknus/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hacknus/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hacknus/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hacknus/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hacknus/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"39f67a08dfed987cb744b9cc2c3752d2a72736e2","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hacknus/egui/commits/39f67a08dfed987cb744b9cc2c3752d2a72736e2","created_at":"2024-10-30T22:33:24Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
