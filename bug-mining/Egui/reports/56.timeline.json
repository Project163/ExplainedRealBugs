https://github.com/emilk/egui/pull/4419\r\nDespite that, I fail to reproduce the two issues it claimed to solve:\r\n\r\n* https://github.com/emilk/egui/issues/4406 may have been solved in another way by this PR\r\n* https://github.com/emilk/egui/issues/4418 I cannot reproduce on Mac. If it is still a problem, I think it should be solved by triggering a `PointerEvent::Released` when focus is lost (i.e. on alt-tab), and not on `PointerGone`","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/emilk/egui/issues/4522/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":1,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/emilk/egui/issues/4522/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":12891714708,"node_id":"REFE_lADOCd2s286G4u08zwAAAAMAZ_SU","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/emilk/egui/issues/events/12891714708","actor":{"login":"emilk","id":1148717,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNDg3MTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1148717?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/emilk","html_url":"https://github.com/emilk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emilk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emilk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emilk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emilk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emilk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emilk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emilk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emilk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/emilk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"c8578c9a6b78ff4b37b86f23264fbf78d826365c","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/emilk/egui/commits/c8578c9a6b78ff4b37b86f23264fbf78d826365c","created_at":"2024-05-22T09:48:35Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":15019612510,"node_id":"REFE_lADOCd2s286G4u08zwAAAAN_PRle","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/emilk/egui/issues/events/15019612510","actor":{"login":"hacknus","id":33124824,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzMTI0ODI0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/33124824?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hacknus","html_url":"https://github.com/hacknus","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hacknus/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hacknus/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hacknus/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hacknus/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hacknus/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hacknus/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hacknus/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hacknus/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hacknus/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"c45faf6703aabd8263e30505732264f6d1bda825","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hacknus/egui/commits/c45faf6703aabd8263e30505732264f6d1bda825","created_at":"2024-10-30T22:33:21Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":15019612710,"node_id":"REFE_lADOCd2s286G4u08zwAAAAN_PRom","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/emilk/egui/issues/events/15019612710","actor":{"login":"hacknus","id":33124824,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzMTI0ODI0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/33124824?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hacknus","html_url":"https://github.com/hacknus","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hacknus/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hacknus/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hacknus/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hacknus/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hacknus/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hacknus/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hacknus/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hacknus/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hacknus/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"6bf0b0ec838e9bb1182e468ef41c249594a5e08d","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hacknus/egui/commits/6bf0b0ec838e9bb1182e468ef41c249594a5e08d","created_at":"2024-10-30T22:33:22Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
