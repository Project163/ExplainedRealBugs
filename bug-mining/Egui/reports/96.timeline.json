look if there is already a similar bug report. If there is, upvote the issue with 👍\r\n\r\nPlease also check if the bug is still present in latest master! Do so by adding the following lines to your Cargo.toml:\r\n\r\n\r\n[patch.crates-io]\r\negui = { git = \"https://github.com/emilk/egui\", branch = \"master\" }\r\n# if you're using eframe:\r\neframe = { git = \"https://github.com/emilk/egui\", branch = \"master\" }\r\n-->\r\n\r\n**Describe the bug**\r\nThere are a few problem with maximizing a native window in `eframe`.\r\n1. Every frame `eframe` provides a `Frame` struct and inside it there is an `IntegrationInfo` struct that you can retrieve with the `info()` method. In the integration info, there is some data about the native window including a boolean that indicates if the window is maximized or not. this boolean doesn't change to true even if the window is maximized. \r\n2. With the persist window option in `NativeOptions` Ive noticed when I start up the app with maximized set to true it does start that way, but instantly shrinks to the previous session's dimensions and if it was closed while maximized it does try to do the dimensions of a maximized window but not actually maximized and it becomes slightly offset.\r\n<!-- A clear and concise description of what the bug is. An image is good, a gif or movie is better! -->\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\nSteps to reproduce the behavior:\r\nI dont know if it matters but here are my egui and eframe in my Cargo.toml\r\n```toml\r\neframe = {version=\"0.23.0\", features = [\"persistence\"]}\r\negui = {version=\"0.23.0\", features = [\"persistence\", \"serde\"]}\r\n```\r\n1. Set `presist_window` to true\r\n3. Run the app\r\n4. Maximize the window\r\n5. Close the window\r\n6. Rerun the the app and the window state wont be persisted correctly\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nWhen opening the window, if the `presist_window` is true and the window was maximized in the last session it should be maximized again in the same monitor.\r\nAlso the `WindowInfo` struct in the `Frame` provided by eframe should have maximized set to true if the window is maximized.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Desktop:**\r\n - OS:
