and 2 more #180 related commits introduce some improved YAML scalars quoting more compliant to the [YAML Spec](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2/spec.html#id2788859), in the MINIMIZE_QUOTES mode; the updated behavior seems to be at least more strict (in quoting) than necessary, as it introduces quoting for any value containing chars as `#` and `:`.\r\n\r\nIf I am not mistaken [YAML Spec](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2/spec.html#id2788859) states that such plain style limitation is applied for cases where the character combinations ` #` (`<space_or_tab>+<#>`) and `: ` (`<:>+<space_or_tab>`) are present, not the single chars `#` and `:`.\r\n\r\nThis PR updates behavior by considering the character combinations and not the single chars.\r\n\r\nThis has been triggered by an update of Jackson from 2.10.4 to 2.11.0 which caused YAML serialization test failures due to the difference in quoting, e.g. in case of scalar representing URIs, JSON references, date or datetime.\r\n\r\nI understand that this is probably not a major issue, and e.g. code or tests can be adjusted in dependent projects and downstream, but I believe the affected scenarios are quite common and it would make sense to keep quotes at a minimum when `minimize` is on.\r\n\r\nNot sure if the target branch `2.11` is the correct one, was wondering if this could make it for 2.11.1 patch release in case.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-dataformats-text/issues/201/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-dataformats-text/issues/201/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":3404599913,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDM0MDQ1OTk5MTM=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-dataformats-text/issues/events/3404599913","actor":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder","html_url":"https://github.com/cowtowncoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"21d1f6771c8391fd6ce5026deae31f69081b0481","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-dataformats-text/commits/21d1f6771c8391fd6ce5026deae31f69081b0481","created_at":"2020-06-04T01:06:14Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"actor":{"login":"bjpe","id":449704,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0OTcwNA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/449704?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bjpe","html_url":"https://github.com/bjpe","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bjpe/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bjpe/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bjpe/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bjpe/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bjpe/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bjpe/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bjpe/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bjpe/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bjpe/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-11-05T11:26:05Z","updated_at":"2020-11-05T11:26:05Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-dataformats-text/issues/230","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-dataformats-text","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-dataformats-text/issues/230/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-dataformats-text/issues/230/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-dataformats-text/issues/230/events","html_url":"https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-dataformats-text/issues/230","id":736850556,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU3MzY4NTA1NTY=","number":230,"title":"YAMLGenerator:

moving from Jackson 2.10.3 to 2.11.3 we discovered that the YAMLGenerator now has a different behaviour when serializing strings that contain special charaters like `{`, `}`, `[`, `]`, `,`. I suspect that this is due to https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-dataformats-text/issues/180. This issue references the YAML spec (https://yaml.org/spec/1.2/spec.html#id2788859), which says\r\n\r\n> In addition, inside flow collections, or when used as implicit keys, plain scalars must not contain the “[”, “]”, “{”, “}” and “,” characters. These characters would cause ambiguity with flow collection structures.\r\n\r\nHowever, the spec says that quoting of strings containing the above mentioned characters is only necessary in **flow collections**, but not outside.\r\n\r\nAre there flags controlling the output of collections as flow collections vs block collections that could additionally be considered? At least, we output YAML in block style, and therefore would expect no quoting for string containing above characters.\r\n\r\nA more elaborated solution might also consider the local context of a string value (in flow collection/in block collection/outside collection).\r\n\r\nOur example file reads\r\n```\r\nTranslatorSpringTest:\r\n  namedParameters: Test with parameter 0 = \"{{param0}}\" and parameter 1 = \"{{param1}}\".\r\n```\r\nand could be read and output as is with Jackson 2.10.3, but got converted to\r\n```\r\nTranslatorSpringTest:\r\n  namedParameters: \"Test with parameter 0 = \\\"{{param0}}\\\" and parameter 1 = \\\"{{param1}}\\\".\"\r\n```\r\nwith Jackson
