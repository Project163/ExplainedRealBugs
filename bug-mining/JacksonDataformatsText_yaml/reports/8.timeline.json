2.x, `JsonParser` and `JsonGenerator` enable `JsonParser.Feature.AUTO_CLOSE_SOURCE` and `JsonGenerator.Feature.AUTO_CLOSE_TARGET` by default. I think it is too intrusive and aggressive to enable these features by default since they operate on input/output stream not owned by parser/generator as the javadoc states.\r\n\r\nBesides this, I found `YAMLGenerator` closes input/output stream always without consulting these features. This makes me can't use `ObjectMapper.writeValue(OutputStream out, Object value)` to write yaml content embedded in another stream, say zipped file stream.\r\n\r\nPS: I saw these features are migrated to `StreamReadFeature` and `StreamWriteFeature` in `master`.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-core/issues/505/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-core/issues/505/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
