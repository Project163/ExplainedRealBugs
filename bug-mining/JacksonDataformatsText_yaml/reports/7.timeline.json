I am unable to use both `spring-boot 5.1.0.M1` (with `JAX-RS` setup) and `swagger-core 2.0.3` / `swagger-jaxrs2 2.0.3` because swagger declares dependencies for such libraries like `snakeyaml` which (! think of it) ONLY needed ONCE when the app starts (to be more precise - when you first time access the swagger endpoints) BUT forces whether usage of compatible libraries versions or simply not using  `5.1.0.M1` or swagger itself.. which seems very very obligative and tightening. As in this particular case `spring boot 5.1.0.M1` uses `1.2+` version of `snakeyaml` and swagger - `1.18` and they are not compatible.\r\nthis would be quiet consistent to embed, repackage them and shade as they are needed for internal usage not to invent the bicycle but right now this regard seems completely out of proper setup as it literally forces a version regardless does one-time job for to generate openapi desc.\r\n\r\nP.S. stacktrace \r\n```java\r\nCaused by: java.lang.NoSuchMethodError: org.yaml.snakeyaml.events.MappingStartEvent.<init>(Ljava/lang/String;Ljava/lang/\r\nString;ZLorg/yaml/snakeyaml/error/Mark;Lorg/yaml/snakeyaml/error/Mark;Ljava/lang/Boolean;)V\r\n        at com.fasterxml.jackson.dataformat.yaml.YAMLGenerator.writeStartObject(YAMLGenerator.java:504)\r\n        at com.fasterxml.jackson.core.base.GeneratorBase.writeStartObject(GeneratorBase.java:286)\r\n        at com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.ser.BeanSerializer.serialize(BeanSerializer.java:151)\r\n        at com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.ser.DefaultSerializerProvider._serialize(DefaultSerializerProvider.java:480)\r\n        at com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.ser.DefaultSerializerProvider.serializeValue(DefaultSerializerProvider.java:31\r\n9)\r\n        at com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.ObjectWriter$Prefetch.serialize(ObjectWriter.java:1396)\r\n        at com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.ObjectWriter._configAndWriteValue(ObjectWriter.java:1120)\r\n        at com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.ObjectWriter.writeValueAsString(ObjectWriter.java:993)\r\n        at io.swagger.v3.core.util.Yaml.pretty(Yaml.java:23)\r\n        at io.swagger.v3.jaxrs2.integration.resources.BaseOpenApiResource.getOpenApi(BaseOpenApiResource.java:74)\r\n        at io.swagger.v3.jaxrs2.integration.resources.OpenApiResource.getOpenApi(OpenApiResource.java:32)\r\n        at sun.reflect.NativeMethodAccessorImpl.invoke0(Native Method)\r\n        at sun.reflect.NativeMethodAccessorImpl.invoke(NativeMethodAccessorImpl.java:62)\r\n        at sun.reflect.DelegatingMethodAccessorImpl.invoke(DelegatingMethodAccessorImpl.java:43)\r\n        at java.lang.reflect.Method.invoke(Method.java:498)\r\n        at org.jboss.resteasy.core.MethodInjectorImpl.invoke(MethodInjectorImpl.java:140)\r\n        at org.jboss.resteasy.core.ResourceMethodInvoker.internalInvokeOnTarget(ResourceMethodInvoker.java:509)\r\n        at org.jboss.resteasy.core.ResourceMethodInvoker.invokeOnTargetAfterFilter(ResourceMethodInvoker.java:399)\r\n        at org.jboss.resteasy.core.ResourceMethodInvoker.lambda$invokeOnTarget$0(ResourceMethodInvoker.java:363)\r\n        at org.jboss.resteasy.core.interception.PreMatchContainerRequestContext.filter(PreMatchContainerRequestContext.j\r\nava:361)\r\n        at org.jboss.resteasy.core.ResourceMethodInvoker.invokeOnTarget(ResourceMethodInvoker.java:365)\r\n        at org.jboss.resteasy.core.ResourceMethodInvoker.invoke(ResourceMethodInvoker.java:337)\r\n        at org.jboss.resteasy.core.ResourceMethodInvoker.invoke(ResourceMethodInvoker.java:310)\r\n        at org.jboss.resteasy.core.SynchronousDispatcher.invoke(SynchronousDispatcher.java:443)\r\n        ... 100 common frames omitted\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nI would also extend the issue to the fact that it uses Jackson the same way, and the same logic as I expressed above relevant to jackson libraries as well, It already has a certain amount of confusion from users when you have swagger's `ObjectMapper` which is also \"a kind of\" configurable but those configurations are not intuatively limited to a subset as only such as naming strategies and some other settings would apply and not serialization/deserialization which are only runtime modifications, of course. But again this is not intuitive. Maybe create a wrapper around `Jackson`'s `ObjectMapper` and expose just some relevant settings in swagger spesific more descriptive way etc.\r\n\r\n1. embed, repackage them and shade `SnakeYaml`\r\n2*. same + wrap with own API for `Jackson` (`ObjectMapper`s for dataformats (`Json` and `Yaml`) as I remember) - this one is not the core of this issue, so less relevant.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/swagger-api/swagger-core/issues/2925/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/swagger-api/swagger-core/issues/2925/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-dataformats-text/issues/comments/417334280","html_url":"https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-dataformats-text/issues/81#issuecomment-417334280","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-dataformats-text/issues/81","id":417334280,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQxNzMzNDI4MA==","user":{"login":"cthiebaud","id":773520,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc3MzUyMA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/773520?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cthiebaud","html_url":"https://github.com/cthiebaud","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cthiebaud/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cthiebaud/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cthiebaud/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cthiebaud/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cthiebaud/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cthiebaud/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cthiebaud/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cthiebaud/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cthiebaud/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-08-30T14:13:34Z","updated_at":"2018-08-30T14:13:34Z","body":"FYI,
