Describe the bug\n\nI'm creating a CronJob from a yaml manifest that contains a ConfigMap volume with octal notation `0555` for the defaultMode.\r\n\r\nWhen creating the resource on the kube server, the API returns this error:\r\n```\r\nCronJob.batch \"conf\" is invalid: [spec.jobTemplate.spec.template.spec.volumes[0].configMap.defaultMode: Invalid value: 555: must be a number between 0 and 0777 (octal)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis worked correctly in version 5.12.4 of the API, however in 6.13.1 it fails.\n\n### Fabric8 Kubernetes Client version\n\n6.13.1\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\nYaml manifest that contains a ConfigMap volume:\r\n\r\n```yaml\r\nvolumes:\r\n- name: resources\r\n  configMap:\r\n    name: conf\r\n    defaultMode: 0555\r\n```\r\n\r\nCreate the resource via the API:\r\n```java\r\nvar resource = Serialization.unmarshal(Files.newInputStream(yamlFile), CronJob.class);\r\n\r\nSystem.out.println(resource.getSpec().getJobTemplate().getSpec().getTemplate().getSpec().getVolumes().get(0).getConfigMap());\r\n\r\nclient.batch().v1().cronjobs()\r\n  .inNamespace(resource.getMetadata().getNamespace())\r\n  .createOrReplace(resource);\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn version 5.12.4, it prints:\r\n```\r\nConfigMapVolumeSource(defaultMode=365 ...)\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn version 6.13.1, it prints the following and fails with the above error.\r\n```\r\nConfigMapVolumeSource(defaultMode=555 ...)\r\n```\r\n\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nThe library should properly convert the octal yaml value into the equivalent value required for json, as it did in previous versions.\n\n### Runtime\n\nKubernetes (vanilla)\n\n### Kubernetes API Server version\n\nother (please specify
