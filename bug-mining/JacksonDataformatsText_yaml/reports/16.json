Here is my code :\r\n```\r\nFile directory = new File(\"src/main/resources/output\");\r\n        String fileName = \"output-multidocs.yaml\";\r\n\r\n        try(SequenceWriter sequenceWriter = mapper.writer().writeValues(new File(directory, fileName))){\r\n            sequenceWriter.init(true);\r\n            sequenceWriter.writeAll(detailsList); // detailsList is an arrayList of object. \r\n            sequenceWriter.writeAll(detailsList); // Expectation is this would create separate doc in the same yaml file. But it was appending to above list.\r\n\r\n        }catch (Exception e){\r\n            e.printStackTrace();\r\n        }\r\n```\r\nCould you please advice me the way to serialize objects into multidocs in a single yaml file.","closed_by":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder","html_url":"https://github.com/cowtowncoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-dataformats-text/issues/163/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-dataformats-text/issues/163/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
