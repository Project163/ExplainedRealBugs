Bug Report Checklist\r\n\r\n- [X] Have you provided a full/minimal spec to reproduce the issue?\r\n- [X] Have you validated the input using an OpenAPI validator ([example](https://apidevtools.org/swagger-parser/online/))?\r\n- [X] What's the version of OpenAPI Generator used?\r\n- [X] Have you search for related issues/PRs?\r\n- [X] What's the actual output vs expected output?\r\n- [ ] [Optional] Bounty to sponsor the fix ([example](https://www.bountysource.com/issues/66123212-javascript-client-produces-a-wrong-object-for-a-string-enum-type-that-is-used-with-ref))\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n##### Description\r\n\r\nopenapi.yaml file generated in the project with `{{{openapi-yaml}}}` like https://github.com/OpenAPITools/openapi-generator/blob/20b8eff6e3dcec5dfe955b5dda1e4b84d8bdce44/modules/openapi-generator/src/main/resources/python-flask/openapi.mustache doesn't use double quotes around string values. \r\nBecause in YAML specification, it seems value true/false, yes/no and on/off can be implicitly convert to boolean unless the value have double quotes.\r\nHere the code in PyYAML: https://github.com/yaml/pyyaml/blob/4c2e993321ad29a02a61c4818f3cef9229219003/lib3/yaml/resolver.py#L170-L175\r\n\r\nExample: The yaml generated should return `- \"no\"` instead of `- no` to avoid implicit convertion.\r\n\r\n##### openapi-generator version\r\n4.0.3-beta\r\nIt can be a regression because it was not present in swagger-codegen\r\n\r\n##### OpenAPI declaration file content or

it be possible to PLEASE add this fix to the jackson 2.9.x versions?  I'm using the latest version of GWT (Google Web Toolkit) which is relegated to using a somewhat older version of Jetty 9.2.  That version of Jetty doesn't play well with the new Java 9 module-info Annotation parsing (you alluded to something similar in your 2.10 release notes).  I'm also willing to open a PR onto the 2.9 branch if that would help.
