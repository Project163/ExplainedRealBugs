after upgrading from the `2.11.4` version of the library to the `2.12.x` line I've noticed that a default YAML mapper...\r\n```java\r\nObjectMapper mapper = new ObjectMapper(new YAMLFactory());\r\n```\r\n...is quoting the `y` character when found as a key, whereas other single character keys (or longer string keys for that matter) are not being quoted. For example, the code...\r\n```java\r\nObjectMapper defaultMapper = new ObjectMapper(new YAMLFactory());\r\n\r\nMap<String, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();\r\nmap.put(\"x\", 1);\r\nmap.put(\"y\", 2);\r\nmap.put(\"z\", 3);\r\ndefaultMapper.writeValueAsString(map);\r\n```\r\n...generates the YAML...\r\n```yml\r\n---\r\nx: 1\r\n\"y\": 2\r\nz: 3\r\n```\r\n...whereas using `2.11.4` it generates:\r\n```yml\r\n---\r\nx: 1\r\ny: 2\r\nz: 3\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhat is the reason behind such new behavior? Thanks.\r\n\r\n(I've uploaded a sample repo (https://github.com/tcrespog/jackson-yml-test) with a simple test that reproduces the aforementioned behavior)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-dataformats-text/issues/278/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-dataformats-text/issues/278/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
