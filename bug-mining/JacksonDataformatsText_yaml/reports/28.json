For example the following test case reproduces the error\r\n\r\n```\r\n    @Test(expected = JsonParseException.class)\r\n    public void testYamlMultiLineNotCanonical() throws Exception {\r\n        String key = \"SomeKey:\\n\\nOtherLine\";\r\n        ObjectMapper jsonMapper = new ObjectMapper();\r\n        ObjectNode jsonRoot = jsonMapper.createObjectNode();\r\n        jsonRoot.put(key, 302);\r\n\r\n        YAMLFactory yamlFactory = new YAMLFactory();\r\n        ObjectMapper yamlObjectMapper = new ObjectMapper(yamlFactory);\r\n        yamlObjectMapper.configure(JsonParser.Feature.STRICT_DUPLICATE_DETECTION, true);\r\n        StringWriter swriter = new StringWriter();\r\n\r\n        yamlObjectMapper.writeValue(swriter, jsonRoot);\r\n\r\n        ObjectMapper readMapper =  new ObjectMapper(yamlFactory);\r\n        ObjectNode readJsonRoot = (ObjectNode) readMapper.readTree(swriter.toString());\r\n        Assert.assertEquals(readJsonRoot.get(key).asInt(),302 );\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\nI would have expected the parser to quote the key as `\\n` and `:` are supported yaml content.\r\n\r\nThere is  work around for this:  Force canonical output.\r\n\r\n```\r\n        yamlFactory.configure(YAMLGenerator.Feature.CANONICAL_OUTPUT, true);\r\n```\r\n\r\nThat however could have other side effects. Maybe I am missing some other configuration that would do the same?\r\n\r\nThoughts, comments are welcomed.\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder","html_url":"https://github.com/cowtowncoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-dataformats-text/issues/306/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-dataformats-text/issues/306/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
