Base64 Mime variant is non compliant as per RFC2045 Section 6.8.  Base64 Content-Transfer-Encoding, which specifies\r\n\r\n>    Any characters outside of the base64 alphabet are to be ignored in\r\n>    base64-encoded data.\r\n\r\nWith this regard, any character including newline characters and whitespace should not be required to fall on 4 character boundaries.\r\n\r\nSample test case that demonstrates the issues (Note I'm using the Yaml dataformat, since base64 mime encoded documents in json strings with (escaped) newlines seems completely broken regardless of whether newlines fall on 4 char boundary or not).\r\n\r\nInput document from \"Example 2.23.

This should not have any baring on the test case provided (since the document **only** consists on the base64 alphabet/whitespace and the document lines are not more than 76 characters).\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-core/issues/414/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-core/issues/414/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":1390439736,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDEzOTA0Mzk3MzY=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-dataformats-text/issues/events/1390439736","actor":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder","html_url":"https://github.com/cowtowncoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"f234258456e2238755bd30dddabe697b5bf1a28c","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-dataformats-text/commits/f234258456e2238755bd30dddabe697b5bf1a28c","created_at":"2017-12-15T22:32:22Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":1390439834,"node_id":"MDE1Ok1pbGVzdG9uZWRFdmVudDEzOTA0Mzk4MzQ=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-dataformats-text/issues/events/1390439834","actor":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder","html_url":"https://github.com/cowtowncoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"milestoned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2017-12-15T22:32:29Z","milestone":{"title":"2.9.4"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-dataformats-text/issues/comments/352128592","html_url":"https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-dataformats-text/issues/62#issuecomment-352128592","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-dataformats-text/issues/62","id":352128592,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM1MjEyODU5Mg==","user":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder","html_url":"https://github.com/cowtowncoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-12-15T22:32:48Z","updated_at":"2017-12-15T22:32:48Z","body":"Fixed
