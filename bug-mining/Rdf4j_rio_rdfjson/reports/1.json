need to make a decision on what version number to use for the initial RDF4J release. There are, roughly, three options:\n1. continue where Sesame left off: Sesame 4.1.0 -> RDF4J 4.1.0. \n2. jump a minor version after the last Sesame release: Sesame 4.1.0 -> RDF4J 4.2.0.\n3. reset. RDF4J 1.0.0.\n\nAdvantage of the first option is that it's a more 'gradual' transition. Potential downside is that it suggests it's not the first Eclipse RDF4J release. \n\nAdvantage of the second option is that it is more clear that there may be compatibility problems between the last Sesame release and the first RDF4J release.\n\nAdvantage of the last option is that we get to start fresh. Downside is that it's not obvious how this release relates to existing Sesame releases.\n\nNo matter what we choose, we will always need to provide accompanying upgrade notes anyway. \n","closed_by":{"login":"abrokenjester","id":728776,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcyODc3Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/728776?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/abrokenjester","html_url":"https://github.com/abrokenjester","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abrokenjester/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abrokenjester/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abrokenjester/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abrokenjester/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abrokenjester/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abrokenjester/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abrokenjester/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abrokenjester/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abrokenjester/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-rdf4j/rdf4j/issues/13/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-rdf4j/rdf4j/issues/13/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
