It is simple to fix without changing the version of Jackson that legal has approved for distribution, but will change the range of Jackson versions that we are compatible with. They had deprecated the API before introducing a new named public API that does exactly the same thing in a newer version and the replacement exists in 2.6 that we have legal approval for.\n","closed_by":{"login":"abrokenjester","id":728776,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcyODc3Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/728776?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/abrokenjester","html_url":"https://github.com/abrokenjester","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abrokenjester/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abrokenjester/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abrokenjester/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abrokenjester/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abrokenjester/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abrokenjester/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abrokenjester/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abrokenjester/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abrokenjester/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-rdf4j/rdf4j/issues/273/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-rdf4j/rdf4j/issues/273/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
