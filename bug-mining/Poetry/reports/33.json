It runs `poetry lock`, mangles the hashes in poetry.lock, then runs `poetry install`. This succeeds, with no errors.\r\n\r\nI would expect `poetry install` to fail in this case, or at least print a warning for packages where the hash does not match.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"sdispater","id":555648,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1NTY0OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/555648?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sdispater","html_url":"https://github.com/sdispater","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sdispater/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sdispater/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sdispater/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sdispater/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sdispater/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sdispater/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sdispater/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sdispater/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sdispater/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python-poetry/poetry/issues/2422/reactions","total_count":73,"+1":73,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python-poetry/poetry/issues/2422/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
