internally).","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python-poetry/poetry/issues/1151/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python-poetry/poetry/issues/1151/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":2392706831,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDIzOTI3MDY4MzE=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python-poetry/poetry/issues/events/2392706831","actor":{"login":"epage","id":60961,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYwOTYx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/60961?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/epage","html_url":"https://github.com/epage","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/epage/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/epage/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/epage/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/epage/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/epage/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/epage/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/epage/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/epage/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/epage/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"990e817ca626354acfa8994427289569b5318656","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/epage/poetry/commits/990e817ca626354acfa8994427289569b5318656","created_at":"2019-06-05T22:32:13Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"actor":{"login":"epage","id":60961,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYwOTYx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/60961?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/epage","html_url":"https://github.com/epage","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/epage/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/epage/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/epage/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/epage/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/epage/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/epage/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/epage/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/epage/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/epage/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-06-05T22:33:18Z","updated_at":"2019-06-05T22:33:18Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python-poetry/poetry/issues/1152","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python-poetry/poetry","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python-poetry/poetry/issues/1152/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python-poetry/poetry/issues/1152/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python-poetry/poetry/issues/1152/events","html_url":"https://github.com/python-poetry/poetry/pull/1152","id":452746911,"node_id":"MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0Mjg1NTc1Mzc2","number":1152,"title":"fix(constraints):

The trailing `3` should be setting the floor for the version","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python-poetry/poetry/issues/1153/reactions","total_count":3,"+1":3,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python-poetry/poetry/issues/1153/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python-poetry/poetry/issues/comments/553390267","html_url":"https://github.com/python-poetry/poetry/issues/1150#issuecomment-553390267","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python-poetry/poetry/issues/1150","id":553390267,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU1MzM5MDI2Nw==","user":{"login":"stale[bot]","id":26384082,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90MjYzODQwODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/1724?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/stale","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stale%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-11-13T12:49:42Z","updated_at":"2019-11-13T12:49:42Z","body":"This issue has been automatically marked as stale because it has not had recent activity.

Current incorrect behavior was originally introduced 2 years ago by commit c55d55a8, where it tried to reset patch version to 0 for tilde expression, and hasn't been fixed by #1481, which only added up to patch version.\r\n\r\nCloses #1150  \r\n\r\n- [x] Added **tests** for changed code.\r\n- [ ] Updated **documentation** for changed code.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python-poetry/poetry/issues/1815/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python-poetry/poetry/issues/1815/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":2925007011,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MjkyNTAwNzAxMQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python-poetry/poetry/issues/events/2925007011","actor":{"login":"sdispater","id":555648,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1NTY0OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/555648?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sdispater","html_url":"https://github.com/sdispater","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sdispater/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sdispater/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sdispater/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sdispater/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sdispater/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sdispater/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sdispater/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sdispater/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sdispater/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-01-06T17:47:39Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2925007199,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDI5MjUwMDcxOTk=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python-poetry/poetry/issues/events/2925007199","actor":{"login":"sdispater","id":555648,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1NTY0OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/555648?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sdispater","html_url":"https://github.com/sdispater","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sdispater/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sdispater/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sdispater/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sdispater/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sdispater/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sdispater/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sdispater/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sdispater/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sdispater/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"950415ca34dfb01a5cbc8c15969a79aeca724ca0","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python-poetry/poetry/commits/950415ca34dfb01a5cbc8c15969a79aeca724ca0","created_at":"2020-01-06T17:47:43Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python-poetry/poetry/issues/comments/1975080336","html_url":"https://github.com/python-poetry/poetry/issues/1150#issuecomment-1975080336","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python-poetry/poetry/issues/1150","id":1975080336,"node_id":"IC_kwDOB1l16s51uVWQ","user":{"login":"github-actions[bot]","id":41898282,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90NDE4OTgyODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/15368?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/github-actions","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-03-03T08:05:47Z","updated_at":"2024-03-03T08:05:47Z","body":"This issue has been automatically locked since there has not been any recent activity after it was closed.
