Install Poetry 1.2.0\r\n2. poetry config virtualenvs.create false\r\n3. Try to run something using `poetry run`. Observe that a message “Skipping virtualenv creation, as specified in config file.” is output to stdout:\r\n```\r\n$ poetry run date 2>/dev/null\r\nSkipping virtualenv creation, as specified in config file.\r\nTue  6 Sep 16:07:21 UTC 2022\r\n```\r\n\r\nOr try `poetry export`:\r\n```\r\n$ poetry export >export.stdout 2>export.stderr\r\n$ cat export.stdout\r\nSkipping virtualenv creation, as specified in config file.\r\nSkipping virtualenv creation, as specified in config file.\r\nUpdating dependencies\r\nResolving dependencies...\r\n\r\nWriting lock file\r\nuseless-py==1.0.3 ; python_version >= \"3.10\" and python_version < \"4.0\" \\\r\n    --hash=sha256:27117ffe3044ffeee36af4572c224e445e04878668c45b133cfe606998c73b2a\r\n$ cat export.stderr\r\nThe lock file does not exist. Locking.\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe way `-q` affects this is inconsistent. With `run` it removes the virtualenv message, with `export` it removes everything, making the command useless (unless `-o` is specified). And while it’s a step in the right direction, someone can write a script using, for example, `poetry run scripts/make-some-json | jq ...` and it will work under the default settings but not for someone who has set up the same codebase with virtualenvs.create=false (for example, in a container). You can’t expect developers to add `-q` to all poetry invocations in scripts just in case at a later point poetry decides to add something to the output.\r\n\r\nSuggested resolution: whenever there’s a “main” output (the machine-readable output of `poetry export`, or `poetry run` that could be anything) that could be saved into a file, piped etc., don’t add anything to it _unless_ `-v` is present, in which case write it to stderr. (When the entirety of the output is generated by poetry itself, e. g. with `poetry install`, there’s no problem with it printing whatever it likes.)","closed_by":{"login":"neersighted","id":1049222,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNDkyMjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1049222?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/neersighted","html_url":"https://github.com/neersighted","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neersighted/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neersighted/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neersighted/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neersighted/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neersighted/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neersighted/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neersighted/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neersighted/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/neersighted/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python-poetry/poetry/issues/6427/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python-poetry/poetry/issues/6427/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
