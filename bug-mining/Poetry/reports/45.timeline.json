#6076 \r\n\r\nI've taken the JSON version of the simple API and converted it into a `LinkSource` so that the package-finding logic in the `PyPiRepository` is very similar to - but annoyingly not quite the same as! - the `LegacyRepository`.\r\n\r\nI've also taken the opportunity to refactor the `LegacyRepository` ever so slightly to emphasise that similarity.  I think I've probably fixed a small bug re caching and pre-releases: previously the processing for ignored pre-releases was skipped when reading from the cache.\r\n\r\nI believe this change will tend to be a modest performance hit.  Eg consider a package like `cryptography`, for which there are maybe a couple of dozen downloads available at each release: to get the available versions we now have to iterate over each of those files and parse their names, rather than simply reading the answer.\r\n\r\nHowever if the API that poetry currently uses is truly deprecated I see little choice but to suck that up - or risk being in an awkward spot when it is turned off.  cf #5970, but worse.\r\n\r\nMost of the changes are in the test fixtures:\r\n- unversioned fixtures were generated from the existing fixtures: I didn't want to

This issue is also currently affecting my team's projects. \r\n\r\nWe recently released a new version of a package developed by us, and we are currently unable to upgrade to it via Poetry. By checking my package on the [JSON API](https://pypi.org/pypi/vdx-helper/json) I noticed that the latest release is indeed not listed there. But, for example, checking [here](https://pypi.org/simple/vdx-helper/), the newest release is listed (3.2.3).\r\n\r\nAre we close to getting a fix?","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python-poetry/poetry/issues/comments/1196661679/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"Luned","id":11210233,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMjEwMjMz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11210233?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Luned","html_url":"https://github.com/Luned","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Luned/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Luned/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Luned/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Luned/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Luned/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Luned/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Luned/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Luned/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Luned/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python-poetry/poetry/issues/comments/1196683111","html_url":"https://github.com/python-poetry/poetry/issues/6076#issuecomment-1196683111","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python-poetry/poetry/issues/6076","id":1196683111,"node_id":"IC_kwDOB1l16s5HU-9n","user":{"login":"dimbleby","id":875184,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg3NTE4NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/875184?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dimbleby","html_url":"https://github.com/dimbleby","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dimbleby/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dimbleby/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dimbleby/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dimbleby/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dimbleby/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dimbleby/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dimbleby/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dimbleby/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dimbleby/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-07-27T12:46:59Z","updated_at":"2022-07-27T12:46:59Z","body":"this issue is not affecting your projects, you are confused with something else.

marked the \"releases\" key deprecated.\r\n\r\nThis would be painful in poetry, which uses that part of the API to determine the available versions of a package.\r\n\r\nPer https://github.com/python-poetry/poetry/issues/6076#issuecomment-1196463451, I think a sensible API and poetry's needs are aligned here:\r\n\r\n- it makes perfect sense to remove most of the information in releases, clients that need all of the _details_ for a particular version can go to the version-specific endpoint (and this is indeed what poetry does)\r\n- but removing the capability even to learn what the available versions _are_ seems like overshoot\r\n\r\nperhaps it would make sense to replace `\"releases\"` with eg `\"versions\"`, listing the available versions.  \r\n\r\nNB parsing the simple API (even in json form) is a less satisfactory approach for poetry.  Eg consider a package like cryptography, for which there are maybe a couple of dozen downloads available at each release: to get the available versions poetry would have to iterate over each of those files and parse their names - rather than simply reading the answer.  Clearly this is much less
