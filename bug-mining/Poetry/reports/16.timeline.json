I've been experimenting with the 1.2 rc because I'm super excited for it, and running into some friction. I'm interested in running [poetry-version-plugin](https://github.com/tiangolo/poetry-version-plugin)\r\n\r\nI've just installed poetry 1.2.0rc1 via  https://install.python-poetry.org (md5sum `6687215717deb5c6d8b86bbca2c043d8`)\r\n\r\n```\r\n❯ python3 ~/install-poetry.py --version 1.2.0rc1  # python3 points to ../Cellar/python@3.9/3.9.12/bin/python3\r\n...\r\nIt will add the `poetry` command to Poetry's bin directory, located at:\r\n\r\n/Users/mike/Library/Python/3.9/bin\r\n...\r\n❯ ln -svf /Users/mike/Library/Python/3.9/bin/poetry ~/.local/bin/poetry\r\n/Users/mike/.local/bin/poetry -> /Users/mike/Library/Python/3.9/bin/poetry\r\n❯ poetry --version\r\nPoetry (version 1.2.0rc1)\r\n```\r\n\r\nI've then activated my virtual environment (I have `virtualenvs.create=false` and like to manage my own venvs). Now, I presume I should be able to run `poetry self add poetry-version-plugin` or `poetry self show plugins` and see existing plugins as a baseline (should see none).
