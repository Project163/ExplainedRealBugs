Fix**\r\n\r\nPreviously, the `mtime` of `setup.py` and `PKG-INFO` was the default value of 0, which showed that the files were last modified on Jan 1st 1970.\r\n\r\nThis created the following warning when using gnu tar:\r\n`implausibly old time stamp 1970-01-01 01:00:00`\r\n\r\nThis commit sets the last modified time of `setup.py` and `PKG-INFO` to the time they are created, and tests that every file in the `sdist` `tar.gz` has a valid (i.e. greater than 0) `mtime`.\r\n\r\nFixes #670.\r\n\r\n# Pull Request Check List\r\n\r\nThis is just a reminder about the most common mistakes.
