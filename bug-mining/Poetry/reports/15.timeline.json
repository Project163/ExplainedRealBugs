Thanks again 🙌 ❤️ -->\r\n\r\nWhen I use `poetry export -f requirements.txt --without-hashes --dev --extras \"optional plotting\" -o requirements.txt`, the **requirements.txt** file ends up with two times the dependencies: https://github.com/colour-science/colour/blob/13c1b407b85296a2504d5617e760317adfc07c1e/requirements.txt#L38\r\n\r\nThis is obviously invalid and breaks applications using the file. I'm assuming the dependencies from Python 2.7 and 3.7 are being collected at the same time. Note that `poetry show` also lists the two sets of dependencies.\r\n\r\nFor now, I'm using `poetry run pip freeze | grep -v \"github.com/colour-science\" > requirements.txt`\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python-poetry/poetry/issues/1438/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python-poetry/poetry/issues/1438/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":2915665532,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDI5MTU2NjU1MzI=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python-poetry/poetry/issues/events/2915665532","actor":{"login":"shenek","id":2659336,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2NTkzMzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2659336?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/shenek","html_url":"https://github.com/shenek","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shenek/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shenek/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shenek/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shenek/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shenek/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shenek/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shenek/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shenek/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shenek/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"4c481809610de49cf5be99333c0298db31a5f8d5","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/shenek/poetry/commits/4c481809610de49cf5be99333c0298db31a5f8d5","created_at":"2019-12-31T13:51:55Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python-poetry/poetry/issues/comments/1975109270","html_url":"https://github.com/python-poetry/poetry/issues/1434#issuecomment-1975109270","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python-poetry/poetry/issues/1434","id":1975109270,"node_id":"IC_kwDOB1l16s51ucaW","user":{"login":"github-actions[bot]","id":41898282,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90NDE4OTgyODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/15368?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/github-actions","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-03-03T10:05:09Z","updated_at":"2024-03-03T10:05:09Z","body":"This issue has been automatically locked since there has not been any recent activity after it was closed.
