(Only\r\n                      valid when uploading to PyPI. Other implementations\r\n                      may not support this.)\r\n```\r\n\r\nI think it would be nice if `poetry publish` supported a similar flag. Right now, `poetry` simply stops uploading distributions when the file already exists:\r\n\r\n```\r\n[HTTPError]\r\n400 Client Error: File already exists. See https://pypi.org/help/#file-name-reuse for url: https://upload.pypi.org/legacy/\r\n```\r\n\r\nRunning `poetry publish --skip-existing` would instead keep going and upload the remaining distributions.
