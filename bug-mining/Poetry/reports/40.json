This option basically says \"don't error out if a file already exists on PyPi, continue to the next\". \r\n\r\nThis is super useful in a number of cases, including with CI/CD pipelines where, on branching, the pipeline will trigger a build for the new branch, but of course that first build will already have a corresponding package in PyPi as the commit it's being built from has already been built on the branch that the new branch was created from. In that case, it's fine for the pipeline to fail to upload the file as it already exists.\r\n\r\nThere are various other use cases for this flag. Could we have an equivalent flag for `poetry publish` ?","closed_by":{"login":"radoering","id":30527984,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwNTI3OTg0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/30527984?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/radoering","html_url":"https://github.com/radoering","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/radoering/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/radoering/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/radoering/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/radoering/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/radoering/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/radoering/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/radoering/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/radoering/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/radoering/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python-poetry/poetry/issues/2254/reactions","total_count":16,"+1":14,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":2,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python-poetry/poetry/issues/2254/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
