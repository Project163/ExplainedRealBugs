#3254\r\n\r\n<!-- This is just a reminder about the most common mistakes. Please make sure that you tick all *appropriate* boxes.  But please read our [contribution guide](https://python-poetry.org/docs/contributing/) at least once, it will save you unnecessary review cycles! -->\r\n\r\n- [x] Added **tests** for changed code.\r\n- [x] Updated **documentation** for changed code.\r\n\r\nI ticked the documentation checkbox simply because I think there is no part in the documentation that I could adjust for this.\r\n\r\n@abn This issue got introduced in 1188b31287df42de615d25b1642ec894c2bb0c12 which you authored; do you think you could give this PR a review?\r\n\r\nThe main logic change here is that I changed marker merging from `intersect` to `union`. The rationale for this can be followed easier if you look at the following (commented) dependency graph from the ticket:\r\n\r\n```\r\npyinstaller 4.0 PyInstaller bundles a Python application and all its dependencies into a single package.\r\n├── altgraph *  # PyInstaller always requires altgraph\r\n├── macholib >=1.8 # This has a marker to only install on darwin\r\n│   └── altgraph >=0.15  # This is a dependency also of macholib\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow the situation is as follows: Since `altgraph` is a non-marked dependency by `PyInstaller` it should *always* be installed, there is no way around this. An intersection of `*` and `sys_platform='darwin'` yields `sys_platform='darwin'` which would result `altgraph` to be only installed on `darwin`. An union ensure that it is installed always.\r\n\r\n<!-- If you have *any* questions to *any* of the points above, just **submit and ask**!
