The default shell profile Terminal uses is zsh. (~/.zshrc)\r\nPoetry does not automatically install to PATH for this type of set up (possibly others).\r\nCould it be set up to handle the different types of shell profiles?\r\n\r\nExample:\r\nI installed poetry via curl:\r\n\r\n```\r\ncurl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/python-poetry/poetry/master/get-poetry.py | python\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd I receive the message:\r\n```\r\nRetrieving Poetry metadata\r\n\r\n# Welcome to Poetry!\r\n\r\nThis will download and install the latest version of Poetry,\r\na dependency and package manager for Python.\r\n\r\nIt will add the `poetry` command to Poetry's bin directory, located at:\r\n\r\n$HOME/.poetry/bin\r\n\r\nThis path will then be added to your `PATH` environment variable by\r\nmodifying the profile files located at:\r\n\r\n$HOME/.profile\r\n$HOME/.zprofile\r\n\r\nYou can uninstall at any time by executing this script with the --uninstall option,\r\nand these changes will be reverted.\r\n\r\nInstalling version: 1.0.9\r\n  - Downloading poetry-1.0.9-darwin.tar.gz (10.46MB)\r\n\r\nPoetry (1.0.9) is installed now. Great!\r\n\r\nTo get started you need Poetry's bin directory ($HOME/.poetry/bin) in your `PATH`\r\nenvironment variable. Next time you log in this will be done\r\nautomatically.\r\n\r\nTo configure your current shell run `source $HOME/.poetry/env`\r\n```\r\n\r\nI do not have either `$HOME/.profile` or `$HOME/.zprofile`, after install I run `poetry --version` and receive:\r\n```\r\nzsh: command not found: poetry\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe ticket #507 was opened before but was closed since the user found that you can manually modify `~/.zshrc` and add `export PATH=\"$HOME/.poetry/bin:$PATH\"` to get it to work. (verified it does work)\r\n\r\nThis ticket is to request the feature of having poetry automatically detect the shell profile and add to the PATH automatically.","closed_by":{"login":"kasteph","id":3408478,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MDg0Nzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3408478?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kasteph","html_url":"https://github.com/kasteph","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kasteph/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kasteph/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kasteph/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kasteph/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kasteph/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kasteph/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kasteph/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kasteph/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kasteph/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python-poetry/poetry/issues/2620/reactions","total_count":4,"+1":4,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python-poetry/poetry/issues/2620/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
