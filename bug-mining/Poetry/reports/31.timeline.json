(MSYS2) and other tools. For example  https://github.com/python-poetry/poetry/issues/2867\r\n\r\nThis distribution has one particularity. Although it is built for Windows, venvs created with it have POSIX-style:\r\n\r\n```\r\nuser1@HOST ~/A/L/p/C/v/somevenv> ls -al\r\ntotal 5\r\ndrwxr-xr-x 1 user1 user1   0 Aug 29 23:05 ./\r\ndrwxr-xr-x 1 user1 user1   0 Aug 29 23:05 ../\r\ndrwxr-xr-x 1 user1 user1   0 Aug 29 23:06 bin/\r\ndrwxr-xr-x 1 user1 user1   0 Aug 29 23:05 include/\r\ndrwxr-xr-x 1 user1 user1   0 Aug 29 23:05 lib/\r\n-rw-r--r-- 1 user1 user1 106 Aug 29 23:05 pyvenv.cfg\r\n````\r\n\r\nThe venvs created with have `lib` and `bin` directories instead of `Scripts` directories.  I suspect that pipx may be expecting a Windows-style venv because the underlying OS is Windows. See https://github.com/pypa/pipx/blob/5e26b3b857a568be7fde40a9ef2caa8f7c0c040d/src/pipx/util.py#L79\r\n\r\nit is possible to detect this python distro with sysconfig.get_platform() . It will return mingw . See https://stackoverflow.com/questions/35956180/how-to-determine-the-python-is-mingw-or-official-build\r\n\r\n\r\n**How to reproduce**\r\n\r\n1 - Install MSYS2 on Windows 10\r\n2 - From MSYS shell, install python mingw64 : `pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-python` and `pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-python-pip`\r\n3 - Install pipx using PIP\r\n4 - `pipx install pycowsay`\r\n5 - The process will never complete and venv will be cleaned and rebuilt in an infinite loop\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\n\r\nInstall should complete successfully\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pypa/pipx/issues/701/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pypa/pipx/issues/701/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"actor":{"login":"s0600204","id":2053873,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwNTM4NzM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2053873?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/s0600204","html_url":"https://github.com/s0600204","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s0600204/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s0600204/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s0600204/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s0600204/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s0600204/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s0600204/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s0600204/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s0600204/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/s0600204/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-09-02T16:11:18Z","updated_at":"2021-09-02T16:11:18Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python-poetry/poetry/issues/4467","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python-poetry/poetry","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python-poetry/poetry/issues/4467/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python-poetry/poetry/issues/4467/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python-poetry/poetry/issues/4467/events","html_url":"https://github.com/python-poetry/poetry/pull/4467","id":986922478,"node_id":"MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0NzI2MDc2MDQ4","number":4467,"title":"Fix
