got the same problem. I replicated the issue by running `poetry new 3362`, ` cd 3362` and `poetry add -vvv ujson`. Other packages, such as `black`, were fine.\r\n\r\nI use Guix OS v1.2.0 which is atypical compare to other Linux distros. It includes a functional package manager which builds every packages from sources. \r\n\r\n* As of now, Guix builds [poetry v1.1.4](http://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/guix.git/tree/gnu/packages/python-xyz.scm#n13180) with [python-pkginfo](http://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/guix.git/tree/gnu/packages/python-xyz.scm#n17131) v1.4.2. \r\n* Poetry poetry.lock at version 1.1.4 specifies [pkginfo](https://github.com/python-poetry/poetry/blob/8312e3f2dbfa126cd311c666fea30656941e1bd3/poetry.lock) must use v1.5.0.1.\r\n* Poetry latest master commit on poetry.lock specifies [pkginfo](https://github.com/python-poetry/poetry/blob/2aab9bcd495e11e5f4491aa72a9510773cc4a90e/poetry.lock#L350) must use v1.6.1.\r\n\r\nAs a solution, I rebuilt Guix's Poetry package to depend on python-pkginfo v1.6.1.\r\n\r\nI noticed the error when I `git clone` Poetry and ran the tests.
