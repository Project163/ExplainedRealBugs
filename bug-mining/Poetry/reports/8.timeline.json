we build a potentially very big list of all the excluded file matching\r\nevery exclude pattern, which could be a lot and then do a containment check on\r\nthe resulting list.\r\n\r\nA first step to

introducing an intermediary solution\r\nthat check if a file name match a glob pattern instead of expanding the glob\r\npattern might be a good solution.
