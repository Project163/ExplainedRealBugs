to 1.1: #4549)\r\n\r\nThe previous implementation would fail to install packages on Windows because it creates a `Path` starting with a slash. Such a `Path` is invalid on Windows. Instead, use the utility function url_to_path.\r\n\r\nAdditionally (not a bug in 1.1, migrated from separate PR at #4532), Links and Paths were passed in to pip_install as a string. This makes it hard for pip_install to parse out the extension of the file to install. By accepting only Links or Paths, pip_install can parse out the extension using the Link. This also resolves a bug when Executor._download_link returns a Link, which can't be parsed by Path(str(link)) on Windows.\r\n\r\nThis was overlooked when running on Linux because file:/path/to/cache is somehow a valid pip install path in Python on Linux, but not a valid path on Windows. With this PR, pip install is always called with a proper Path (/path/to/cache) and never a Path-parsed Link (file:/path/to/cache)\r\n\r\n# Pull Request Check List\r\n\r\nResolves: #4479 #4535\r\n\r\n<!-- This is just a reminder about the most common mistakes.

@dibog Wait a while for the next release. In the meantime, you can install the branch with:\r\n> \r\n> ```\r\n> (Invoke-WebRequest -Uri https://raw.githubusercontent.com/python-poetry/poetry/master/install-poetry.py -UseBasicParsing).Content | python - --git git+https://github.com/python-poetry/poetry.git@1.1\r\n> ```\r\n\r\nIs this also available in the preview version (1.2.x) yet? I want to keep using that version, but I really need this patch.","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python-poetry/poetry/issues/comments/983625116/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"lululukas","id":50951168,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwOTUxMTY4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/50951168?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lululukas","html_url":"https://github.com/lululukas","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lululukas/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lululukas/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lululukas/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lululukas/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lululukas/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lululukas/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lululukas/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lululukas/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lululukas/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":5698895975,"node_id":"MEE_lADOB1l16s469W9DzwAAAAFTrkBn","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python-poetry/poetry/issues/events/5698895975","actor":{"login":"dibog","id":1060258,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNjAyNTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1060258?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dibog","html_url":"https://github.com/dibog","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dibog/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dibog/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dibog/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dibog/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dibog/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dibog/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dibog/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dibog/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dibog/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-12-01T13:09:26Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
