However subprocess.run() does - if you pass check=True.\r\n- subprocess.run()  is not available on Python 3.4 or earlier - however, we can use the subprocess32 backport. in fact, the code to add the equivalent check around the existing communicate() call wasn't extensive - but this way uses the preferred mechanism ( subprocess.run() ) and we don't need to effectively re-implement subprocess.run() in env.py.\r\n- I leveraged the existing approach in _compat.py to pull in the backport - ie similar to pathlib2.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python-poetry/poetry/issues/1075/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python-poetry/poetry/issues/1075/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"actor":{"login":"Imaclean74","id":6381576,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzODE1NzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6381576?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Imaclean74","html_url":"https://github.com/Imaclean74","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Imaclean74/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Imaclean74/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Imaclean74/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Imaclean74/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Imaclean74/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Imaclean74/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Imaclean74/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Imaclean74/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Imaclean74/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-05-16T23:34:13Z","updated_at":"2019-05-16T23:34:13Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python-poetry/poetry/issues/1097","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python-poetry/poetry","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python-poetry/poetry/issues/1097/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python-poetry/poetry/issues/1097/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python-poetry/poetry/issues/1097/events","html_url":"https://github.com/python-poetry/poetry/issues/1097","id":443360900,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU0NDMzNjA5MDA=","number":1097,"title":"Maybe

Thanks again 🙌 ❤️ -->\r\n\r\nIn utils/env.py, Poetry collects several sorts of system/environment information via subprocesses with communicate(encode(str)). Many have reported issues of suffering JSONDecodeError here. As most of them dug further for the root cause case by case, I think the code is potentially not so proper when calling for the splitting of stdout and stderr.\r\nHere is the original code from my copy of Poetry, installed from pip:\r\n`            if input_:\r\n                p = subprocess.Popen(\r\n                    cmd,\r\n                    stdin=subprocess.PIPE,\r\n                    stdout=subprocess.PIPE,\r\n                    stderr=subprocess.STDOUT,\r\n                    **kwargs\r\n                )\r\n                output = p.communicate(encode(input_))[0]`\r\nAs we can see if we do feed stderr with subprocess.STDOUT, the error messages will be mixed into the actual outputs. Regarding that Poetry quite often calls json.loads on the output, whenever there is error logs, the stdout(with stderr mixed in) is not a proper Json by any means.\r\nIn my case, It is like this:\r\n`(b'The system cannot find the path specified.\\r\\n{\"implementation_name\": \"cpython\", \"implementation_version\": \"3.6.2\", \"os_name\": \"nt\", \"platform_machine\": \"AMD64\", \"platform_release\": \"10\", \"platform_system\": \"Windows\", \"platform_version\": \"10.0.16299\", \"python_full_version\": \"3.6.2\", \"platform_python_implementation\": \"CPython\", \"python_version\": \"3.6\", \"sys_platform\": \"win32\", \"version_info\": [3, 6, 2, \"final\", 0]}\\r\\n', None)`\r\nWhich obviously corrupts the upcoming json.loads()\r\nWhile, suggested, maybe we should be adopting it like this. (Though in the current code, it never cares about the stdout, which is fine, but we do need to eliminate error logs out of the stdout)\r\n\r\nAfter I have changed it to:\r\n`            if input_:\r\n                p = subprocess.Popen(\r\n                    cmd,\r\n                    stdin=subprocess.PIPE,\r\n                    stdout=subprocess.PIPE,\r\n                    stderr=subprocess.PIPE, #or None the later codes do not care about it\r\n                    **kwargs\r\n                )\r\n                output = p.communicate(encode(input_))[0]`\r\nI can get:\r\n`(b'{\"implementation_name\": \"cpython\", \"implementation_version\": \"3.6.2\", \"os_name\": \"nt\", \"platform_machine\": \"AMD64\", \"platform_release\": \"10\", \"platform_system\": \"Windows\", \"platform_version\": \"10.0.16299\", \"python_full_version\": \"3.6.2\", \"platform_python_implementation\": \"CPython\", \"python_version\": \"3.6\", \"sys_platform\": \"win32\", \"version_info\": [3, 6, 2, \"final\", 0]}\\r\\n', b'The system cannot find the path specified.\\r\\n')` if with PIPE\r\nand\r\n`(b'{\"implementation_name\": \"cpython\", \"implementation_version\": \"3.6.2\", \"os_name\": \"nt\", \"platform_machine\": \"AMD64\", \"platform_release\": \"10\", \"platform_system\": \"Windows\", \"platform_version\": \"10.0.16299\", \"python_full_version\": \"3.6.2\", \"platform_python_implementation\": \"CPython\", \"python_version\": \"3.6\", \"sys_platform\": \"win32\", \"version_info\": [3, 6, 2, \"final\", 0]}\\r\\n', None)` if with None\r\n\r\nWhich definitely in my opinion makes more senses, as no matter if we do care about the stderr or not, it will not damage the upcoming parsing codes.\r\n\r\nPlease suggest if any better approach could be engaged.\r\nPlease don't redirect it to that why b'The system cannot find the path specified.\\r\\n pops up, it might be the issue with my Anaconda or Windows, it might be the issue with Poetry, It's just not what i am talking now, since whatever gets thrown as an err, JSONDecodeError happens. Which is mostly what we don't want to have. Also afaik this part is embedded firmly inside the commands mechanism of Poetry, trying to do things with try catch with some kind of alternative logic is not even realistic, and heavily not encouraged impov. (It won't solve any problem any way since we are using Poetry from CLI not Python context, and those system information is critical, not dodge-able.)\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python-poetry/poetry/issues/1097/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python-poetry/poetry/issues/1097/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":2449575343,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MjQ0OTU3NTM0Mw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python-poetry/poetry/issues/events/2449575343","actor":{"login":"sdispater","id":555648,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1NTY0OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/555648?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sdispater","html_url":"https://github.com/sdispater","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sdispater/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sdispater/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sdispater/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sdispater/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sdispater/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sdispater/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sdispater/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sdispater/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sdispater/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-06-30T19:53:45Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2449575431,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDI0NDk1NzU0MzE=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python-poetry/poetry/issues/events/2449575431","actor":{"login":"sdispater","id":555648,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1NTY0OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/555648?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sdispater","html_url":"https://github.com/sdispater","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sdispater/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sdispater/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sdispater/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sdispater/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sdispater/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sdispater/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sdispater/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sdispater/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sdispater/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"1ba6be8bb5374c85c20d5bb8c59ef29a30d0bcff","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python-poetry/poetry/commits/1ba6be8bb5374c85c20d5bb8c59ef29a30d0bcff","created_at":"2019-06-30T19:53:53Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python-poetry/poetry/issues/comments/507075708","html_url":"https://github.com/python-poetry/poetry/issues/1074#issuecomment-507075708","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python-poetry/poetry/issues/1074","id":507075708,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUwNzA3NTcwOA==","user":{"login":"Imaclean74","id":6381576,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzODE1NzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6381576?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Imaclean74","html_url":"https://github.com/Imaclean74","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Imaclean74/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Imaclean74/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Imaclean74/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Imaclean74/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Imaclean74/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Imaclean74/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Imaclean74/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Imaclean74/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Imaclean74/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-06-30T23:22:04Z","updated_at":"2019-06-30T23:22:04Z","body":"Thanks
