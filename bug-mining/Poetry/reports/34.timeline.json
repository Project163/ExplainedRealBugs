If I recall correctly, `pip` will happily install a sub-dependency despite conflicting versions being specified by two direct dependencies... in fact I think which version it ends up installing depends on the order in `requirements.txt`. Yuck! Only very recently has it even started issuing a warning for cases like this.\r\n\r\nIn contrast, `poetry` does this right. It computes the entire dependency tree and will complain if there are conflicts anywhere in the tree.\r\n\r\nBut... many packages out there are not specifying their dependencies properly. Even if they are, there's always the possibility that their specified dependencies are a tighter range than they strictly need to be. \r\n\r\nIs there a way to tell Poetry to force a specific version (or version) range of a dependency in cases like this — or in other words, to ignore a dependency specification of another dependency somewhere in the tree? If not, should there be?\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python-poetry/poetry/issues/697/reactions","total_count":205,"+1":197,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":2,"confused":0,"heart":1,"rocket":3,"eyes":2},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python-poetry/poetry/issues/697/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"not_planned"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":5255153467,"node_id":"CE_lADOB1l16s41zWgtzwAAAAE5O0c7","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python-poetry/poetry/issues/events/5255153467","actor":{"login":"finswimmer","id":2164565,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxNjQ1NjU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2164565?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/finswimmer","html_url":"https://github.com/finswimmer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/finswimmer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/finswimmer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/finswimmer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/finswimmer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/finswimmer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/finswimmer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/finswimmer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/finswimmer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/finswimmer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-09-03T19:20:58Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":5255153546,"node_id":"REFE_lADOB1l16s41zWgtzwAAAAE5O0eK","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python-poetry/poetry/issues/events/5255153546","actor":{"login":"finswimmer","id":2164565,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxNjQ1NjU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2164565?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/finswimmer","html_url":"https://github.com/finswimmer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/finswimmer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/finswimmer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/finswimmer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/finswimmer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/finswimmer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/finswimmer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/finswimmer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/finswimmer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/finswimmer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"c320955007a36173245c24d16076f9cf06b334c9","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python-poetry/poetry/commits/c320955007a36173245c24d16076f9cf06b334c9","created_at":"2021-09-03T19:21:00Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python-poetry/poetry/issues/comments/912826068","html_url":"https://github.com/python-poetry/poetry/issues/4109#issuecomment-912826068","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python-poetry/poetry/issues/4109","id":912826068,"node_id":"IC_kwDOB1l16s42aJ7U","user":{"login":"colindean","id":197224,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NzIyNA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/197224?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/colindean","html_url":"https://github.com/colindean","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/colindean/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/colindean/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/colindean/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/colindean/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/colindean/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/colindean/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/colindean/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/colindean/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/colindean/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-09-03T21:42:30Z","updated_at":"2021-09-03T21:42:30Z","body":"Thank
