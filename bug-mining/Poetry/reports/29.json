Thank you for discovering and submitting an issue.\r\n\r\n  Before you submit this; let's make sure of a few things.\r\n  Please make sure the following boxes are ticked if they are correct.\r\n  If not, please try and fulfill these first.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<!-- Checked checkbox should look like this: [x] -->\r\n- [x] I am on the [latest](https://github.com/python-poetry/poetry/releases/latest) Poetry version.\r\n- [x] I have searched the [issues](https://github.com/python-poetry/poetry/issues) of this repo and believe that this is not a duplicate.\r\n- [x] If an exception occurs when executing a command, I executed it again in debug mode (`-vvv` option).\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n  Once those are done, if you're able to fill in the following list with your information,\r\n  it'd be very helpful to whoever handles the issue.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n- **OS version and name**: Fedora 33\r\n- **Poetry version**: 1.1.3\r\n- **Link of a [Gist](https://gist.github.com/) with the contents of your pyproject.toml file**: https://gist.github.com/apollo13/cda3ea5e3a135d67eeed4be099bcb7e9\r\n\r\n## Issue\r\n\r\nThe linked pyproject.toml generates a broken requirements.txt (it wrongly applies `sys_platform=darwin`). But first off lets see the graph:\r\n```\r\npyinstaller 4.0 PyInstaller bundles a Python application and all its dependencies into a single package.\r\n├── altgraph *\r\n├── macholib >=1.8\r\n│   └── altgraph >=0.15 \r\n├── pefile >=2017.8.1\r\n│   └── future * \r\n├── pyinstaller-hooks-contrib >=2020.6\r\n└── pywin32-ctypes >=0.2.0\r\n```\r\n\r\nas we can see the toplevel dependency `pyinstaller` directly requires `althgraph` and then `macholib` also requires `altgraph`.\r\n\r\nLooking at `poetry.lock` we see:\r\n```\r\n[[package]]\r\nname = \"pyinstaller\"\r\nversion = \"4.0\"\r\ndescription = \"PyInstaller bundles a Python application and all its dependencies into a single package.\"\r\ncategory = \"main\"\r\noptional = false\r\npython-versions = \"*\"\r\n\r\n[package.dependencies]\r\naltgraph = \"*\"\r\nmacholib = {version = \">=1.8\", markers = \"sys_platform == \\\"darwin\\\"\"}\r\npefile = {version = \">=2017.8.1\", markers = \"sys_platform == \\\"win32\\\"\"}\r\npyinstaller-hooks-contrib = \">=2020.6\"\r\npywin32-ctypes = {version = \">=0.2.0\", markers = \"sys_platform == \\\"win32\\\"\"}\r\n\r\n[[package]]\r\nname = \"macholib\"\r\nversion = \"1.14\"\r\ndescription = \"Mach-O header analysis and editing\"\r\ncategory = \"main\"\r\noptional = false\r\npython-versions = \"*\"\r\n\r\n[package.dependencies]\r\naltgraph = \">=0.15\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis tells us that `pyinstaller` depends on `macholib` on darwin systems. The export looks like this:\r\n```\r\naltgraph==0.17; sys_platform == \"darwin\" \\\r\n    --hash=sha256:c623e5f3408ca61d4016f23a681b9adb100802ca3e3da5e718915a9e4052cebe \\\r\n    --hash=sha256:1f05a47122542f97028caf78775a095fbe6a2699b5089de8477eb583167d69aa\r\nfuture==0.18.2; python_version >= \"2.6\" and python_full_version < \"3.0.0\" and sys_platform == \"win32\" or python_full_version >= \"3.3.0\" and sys_platform == \"win32\" \\\r\n    --hash=sha256:b1bead90b70cf6ec3f0710ae53a525360fa360d306a86583adc6bf83a4db537d\r\nmacholib==1.14; sys_platform == \"darwin\" \\\r\n    --hash=sha256:c500f02867515e6c60a27875b408920d18332ddf96b4035ef03beddd782d4281 \\\r\n    --hash=sha256:0c436bc847e7b1d9bda0560351bf76d7caf930fb585a828d13608839ef42c432\r\npefile==2019.4.18; sys_platform == \"win32\" \\\r\n    --hash=sha256:a5d6e8305c6b210849b47a6174ddf9c452b2888340b8177874b862ba6c207645\r\npyinstaller-hooks-contrib==2020.9 \\\r\n    --hash=sha256:a5fd45a920012802e3f2089e1d3501ef2f49265dfea8fc46c3310f18e3326c91 \\\r\n    --hash=sha256:c382f3ac1a42b45cfecd581475c36db77da90e479b2f5bcb6d840d21fa545114\r\npyinstaller==4.0 \\\r\n    --hash=sha256:970beb07115761d5e4ec317c1351b712fd90ae7f23994db914c633281f99bab0\r\npywin32-ctypes==0.2.0; sys_platform == \"win32\" \\\r\n    --hash=sha256:24ffc3b341d457d48e8922352130cf2644024a4ff09762a2261fd34c36ee5942 \\\r\n    --hash=sha256:9dc2d991b3479cc2df15930958b674a48a227d5361d413827a4cfd0b5876fc98\r\n```\r\n\r\nHere `altgraph` is incorrectly labeled as `darwin`, propbably due to the fact that `macholib` is only required on `darwin` and as such the constraints trickles down.
