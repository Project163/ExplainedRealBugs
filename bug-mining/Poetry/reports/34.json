You may be getting outdated dependencies. Run update to update them.' (from line 1 of requirements.txt)\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt appears that my Poetry lockfile is out of sync. No biggie, that's correctable and logged in #3092 when it's not necessary to resync.\r\n\r\nHowever, this error message should not make it into the output of the `poetry export` command. That error log line should go to stderr, not stdout.\r\n\r\n## Proposed Fix\r\n\r\nI think that the `self.line` here https://github.com/python-poetry/poetry/blob/b753aaf4c3c08ef0e54941a6616fe318fdf4f6e4/poetry/console/commands/export.py#L56-L63\r\nshould be `self.line_error` which, according to the [docstring for that method](https://github.com/sdispater/cleo/blob/9d289bf709ab2119b58e95da58a655ab70661798/cleo/commands/command.py#L262-L276) outputs to stderr instead of stdout.","closed_by":{"login":"finswimmer","id":2164565,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxNjQ1NjU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2164565?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/finswimmer","html_url":"https://github.com/finswimmer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/finswimmer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/finswimmer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/finswimmer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/finswimmer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/finswimmer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/finswimmer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/finswimmer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/finswimmer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/finswimmer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python-poetry/poetry/issues/4109/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python-poetry/poetry/issues/4109/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
