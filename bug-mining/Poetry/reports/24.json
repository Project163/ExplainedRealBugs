Thanks again 🙌 ❤️ -->\r\n\r\nThis issue is about docs on configuration option [`virtualenvs.create`](https://python-poetry.org/docs/configuration/#virtualenvscreate-boolean). Currently it says about what happens when option is true. I think, its better to state explicitly, that when option is `false`, then `poetry` will install dependencies to current python interpreter/virtualenv.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"finswimmer","id":2164565,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxNjQ1NjU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2164565?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/finswimmer","html_url":"https://github.com/finswimmer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/finswimmer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/finswimmer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/finswimmer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/finswimmer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/finswimmer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/finswimmer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/finswimmer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/finswimmer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/finswimmer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python-poetry/poetry/issues/1969/reactions","total_count":14,"+1":14,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python-poetry/poetry/issues/1969/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
