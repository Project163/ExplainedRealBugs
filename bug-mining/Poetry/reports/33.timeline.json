I had some trouble setting up my local dev environment for poetry, so no unit tests yet. How do I get proper tracebacks out of poetry? I only get the last line not a full traceback or no line at all and just the exception name.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python-poetry/poetry-core/issues/113/reactions","total_count":8,"+1":8,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python-poetry/poetry-core/issues/113/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"actor":{"login":"FlorianLudwig","id":432263,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzMjI2Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/432263?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/FlorianLudwig","html_url":"https://github.com/FlorianLudwig","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FlorianLudwig/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FlorianLudwig/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FlorianLudwig/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FlorianLudwig/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FlorianLudwig/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FlorianLudwig/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FlorianLudwig/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FlorianLudwig/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FlorianLudwig/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-11-27T10:19:45Z","updated_at":"2020-11-27T10:19:45Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python-poetry/poetry/issues/3423","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python-poetry/poetry","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python-poetry/poetry/issues/3423/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python-poetry/poetry/issues/3423/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python-poetry/poetry/issues/3423/events","html_url":"https://github.com/python-poetry/poetry/pull/3423","id":752142289,"node_id":"MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0NTI4NTIzMTg4","number":3423,"title":"Cleanup

Please make sure that you tick all *appropriate* boxes.

When choosing a download link the hash sum is queried from the repo and checked against a list of known hashes\r\n2. After downloading the downloaded package is checked to have one of the known hashes\r\n\r\nThis MR changes a few things:\r\n\r\n1. Only check against the hash for the corresponding file name instead of all hashes - this improves security and makes it possible to improve output to the user.\r\n2. Improve output: I the current version* if the hash mismatches this could be for two reasons, the hash is for a different file (e.g. the lock file was created for the .tar.gz but it was deleted and a wheel was uploaded instead) or because the hash of the file does not match. These are two different scenarios which the user cannot differentiate. This MR makes it transparent for the user what is actually happening.\r\n3. Code Clean-up: When selecting which link to use for download, if a matching hash exists for the link is considered. But the code filters out all links with mismatching hashes before the sorting is even reached. So that part was removed.\r\n\r\n```\r\n* The current version does not validate hashes at all. I am referring to how the code is intended to do it.\r\n```\r\n\r\n# Open TODOs\r\n1. This really needs proper tests - and I am willing to contribute them but I had some difficulties, [see other MR](https://github.com/python-poetry/poetry-core/pull/113)\r\n2. I am not sure about how to properly handle the error/warning output when a mismatching hash occurs. I python logging - which I guess is okay but not as nice to look at as the usual poetry output. On the other hand, mismatching hashes means something ugly is going on... :man_shrugging: \r\n3. Docs need to be added - but I would welcome input on code and CLI output before updating the docs.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python-poetry/poetry/issues/3423/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python-poetry/poetry/issues/3423/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python-poetry/poetry/issues/comments/800425086","html_url":"https://github.com/python-poetry/poetry/issues/2422#issuecomment-800425086","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python-poetry/poetry/issues/2422","id":800425086,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDgwMDQyNTA4Ng==","user":{"login":"signed8bit","id":1141845,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNDE4NDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1141845?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/signed8bit","html_url":"https://github.com/signed8bit","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/signed8bit/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/signed8bit/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/signed8bit/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/signed8bit/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/signed8bit/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/signed8bit/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/signed8bit/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/signed8bit/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/signed8bit/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-03-16T16:41:33Z","updated_at":"2021-03-16T16:41:33Z","body":"It's a bit concerning that this issue has been open for nearly a year now.

Note that Poetry will still be able to manage Python 3.4 environments.\r\n- [x] Python 2.7 and 3.5 deprecation (#2683).\r\n\r\n## 1.2\r\n- [x] Plugin system (#693, #1237).\r\n- [ ] Implementation of a `bundle` command, see #537 for more context. This command should be pluggable via the plugin system (#1992, #2682).\r\n- [ ] Improve dependency resolution. Better support for system specific wheels and speed improvements.\r\n- [ ] Development of a package registry to speed up dependency resolution of packages with missing metadata.\r\n- [ ] Second phase of improving the packages installation speed: Implementation of a separate library to replace calls to `pip` for installation. This will be an opt-in feature in this release.\r\n- [x] Add support for dependency groups (#1644). \r\n- [x] Drop Python 2.7 and 3.5 support.\r\n## 1.3\r\n- [ ] Third phase of improving the package installation speed : Make the phase 2 feature the default one with the possibility to opt out.\r\n\r\n## 1.4\r\n- [ ] Fourth phase of improving the package installation speed : Disable the possibility to opt out of the  phase 2 feature as it should be stable by now.\r\n\r\n## 2.0\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python-poetry/poetry/issues/1856/reactions","total_count":341,"+1":175,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":63,"confused":0,"heart":29,"rocket":74,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python-poetry/poetry/issues/1856/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python-poetry/poetry/issues/comments/822547474","html_url":"https://github.com/python-poetry/poetry/issues/2422#issuecomment-822547474","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python-poetry/poetry/issues/2422","id":822547474,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDgyMjU0NzQ3NA==","user":{"login":"cburgess","id":1141414,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNDE0MTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1141414?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cburgess","html_url":"https://github.com/cburgess","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cburgess/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cburgess/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cburgess/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cburgess/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cburgess/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cburgess/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cburgess/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cburgess/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cburgess/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-04-19T15:11:54Z","updated_at":"2021-04-19T15:11:54Z","body":"I very much agree we need to get something merged and released to address this.
