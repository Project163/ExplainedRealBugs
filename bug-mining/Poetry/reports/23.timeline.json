decided to dig a little more into why this happens.\r\n\r\nSo it looks like poetry went to pypi to get the `info.required_dists` but p4python doesn't have that information in pypi's database\r\n\r\n- p4python example: https://pypi.org/pypi/p4python/2018.2.1743033/json\r\n- example of `info.required_dists`: https://pypi.org/pypi/black/json\r\n\r\nSo poetry looks at all of the wheels.  It will only look at the wheels if\r\n- there is a universal wheel\r\n- there is a platform wheel and no sdist\r\n\r\nBecause p4python is not universal and has an sdist, the sdist is favored.\r\n\r\nSo poetry downloads and tries to use the sdist.  The problem is the sdist is probably built from source within perforce where all of the files are marked read-only unless someone is editing them.  This then causes problems with the use of `rmtree`.","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python-poetry/poetry/issues/comments/497495185/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"epage","id":60961,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYwOTYx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/60961?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/epage","html_url":"https://github.com/epage","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/epage/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/epage/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/epage/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/epage/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/epage/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/epage/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/epage/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/epage/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/epage/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python-poetry/poetry/issues/comments/497495723","html_url":"https://github.com/python-poetry/poetry/issues/520#issuecomment-497495723","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python-poetry/poetry/issues/520","id":497495723,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ5NzQ5NTcyMw==","user":{"login":"epage","id":60961,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYwOTYx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/60961?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/epage","html_url":"https://github.com/epage","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/epage/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/epage/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/epage/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/epage/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/epage/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/epage/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/epage/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/epage/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/epage/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-05-30T21:39:28Z","updated_at":"2019-05-30T21:39:28Z","body":"A
