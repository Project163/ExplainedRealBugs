Pull Request Check List\r\n\r\nResolves: #3144 \r\n\r\nI'm not really sure any of the two check-boxes apply for this change. Is the effort of preparing `os.environ` for the unit-test really worth the effort? Considering that this might interfere with other tests, so it needs to be mocked or patched. I feel that all this effort for this small change is a bit over-the-top. The call itself (and thus a runtime syntax-error) is already covered by existing tests.\r\n\r\nIf you disagree, let me know and I will add the required test.\r\n\r\nAs for documentation, as this is an internal change not externally visible I don't think it warrants docs. Again, let me know if you disagree.\r\n\r\nAnd finally, I decided to target `master` instead of `develop` for this PR because it is a bugfix on the current released version. But that's anyway something you can modify yourself 😉 \r\n\r\n- [ ] Added **tests** for changed code.\r\n- [ ] Updated **documentation** for changed

Since this issue is already closed, I would recommend creating a new issue if an open one for the errors you are facing does not already exist.\r\n\r\n@Jihadik @pepastach if you are encountering issues with the new installer, you can refer [here](https://python-poetry.org/blog/announcing-poetry-1-1-0.html#brand-new-installer) on how it can be disabled until it stablises.\r\n\r\n@Jihadik Regarding the `Connection pool is full, discarding connection: pypi.org`, that is the `requests` library recreating connections to `pypi.org`, it is a graceful recovery and should not impact functionality under normal circumstances. Regarding the errors, as I mentioned above, more details will be appreciated.","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python-poetry/poetry/issues/comments/707886051/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"abn","id":165325,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NTMyNQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/165325?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/abn","html_url":"https://github.com/abn","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abn/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abn/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abn/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abn/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abn/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abn/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abn/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abn/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abn/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":3872560414,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50Mzg3MjU2MDQxNA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python-poetry/poetry/issues/events/3872560414","actor":{"login":"pepastach","id":10232308,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMjMyMzA4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10232308?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pepastach","html_url":"https://github.com/pepastach","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pepastach/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pepastach/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pepastach/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pepastach/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pepastach/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pepastach/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pepastach/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pepastach/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pepastach/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-10-13T17:11:04Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3872560420,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDM4NzI1NjA0MjA=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python-poetry/poetry/issues/events/3872560420","actor":{"login":"pepastach","id":10232308,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMjMyMzA4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10232308?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pepastach","html_url":"https://github.com/pepastach","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pepastach/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pepastach/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pepastach/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pepastach/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pepastach/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pepastach/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pepastach/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pepastach/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pepastach/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-10-13T17:11:04Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3872560428,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50Mzg3MjU2MDQyOA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python-poetry/poetry/issues/events/3872560428","actor":{"login":"al-muammar","id":11528067,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTI4MDY3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11528067?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/al-muammar","html_url":"https://github.com/al-muammar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/al-muammar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/al-muammar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/al-muammar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/al-muammar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/al-muammar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/al-muammar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/al-muammar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/al-muammar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/al-muammar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-10-13T17:11:04Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3872560431,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDM4NzI1NjA0MzE=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python-poet

Thanks again 🙌 ❤️ -->\r\nWe run `poetry install --remove-untracked` and the process randomly fails on various \"missing\" environment variables. This has been reported in #3144 for the `PATH` variable (which happens quite a lot, more than other variables), but I have seen it for many other variables (often GitLab or Docker related). In all cases they are defined.\r\n\r\nIt fails really randomly. Different dependencies being installed, different environment variables. Sometimes it does not fail (but most often it does). \r\nSometimes it fails on multiple environment variables. Like `KeyError 'PATH'`, `KeyError 'CI_JOB_STAGE'` or `KeyError 'DOCKER_ENV_CI_DISPOSABLE_ENVIRONMENT'` in the same run. It seems to me like some kind of race condition in the parallel install. I can't prove this hypothesis until we can disable parallel installation. I think it's scheduled for an upcoming release.\r\n\r\nHere is an example output where it fails on the `PATH` variable.\r\n```\r\nCreating virtualenv bp-xxx-3RqKXHa2-py3.7 in /builds/xxx/.cache/poetry/pypoetry/virtualenvs\r\nInstalling dependencies from lock file\r\nPackage operations: 106 installs, 0 updates, 0 removals\r\n  • Installing attrs (20.2.0)\r\n  • Installing six (1.15.0)\r\n  • Installing cattrs (1.0.0)\r\n...\r\nStack trace:\r\n  8  /usr/local/lib/python3.7/site-packages/poetry/installation/executor.py:199 in _execute_operation\r\n      197│ \r\n      198│             try:\r\n    → 199│                 result = self._do_execute_operation(operation)\r\n      200│             except EnvCommandError as e:\r\n      201│                 if e.e.returncode == -2:\r\n  7  /usr/local/lib/python3.7/site-packages/poetry/installation/executor.py:273 in _do_execute_operation\r\n      271│             return 0\r\n      272│ \r\n    → 273│         result = getattr(self, \"_execute_{}\".format(method))(operation)\r\n      274│ \r\n      275│         if result != 0:\r\n  6  /usr/local/lib/python3.7/site-packages/poetry/installation/executor.py:408 in _execute_install\r\n      406│ \r\n      407│     def _execute_install(self, operation):  #
