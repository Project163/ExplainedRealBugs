[x] I have searched the [issues](https://github.com/python-poetry/poetry/issues) of this repo and believe that this is not a duplicate.\r\n- [x] I have searched the [documentation](https://python-poetry.org/docs/) and believe that my question is not covered.\r\n\r\n## Feature Request\r\n\r\nWhen installed, Poetry installs the latest available versions of packages in it's dependency graph.\r\n\r\nThis has lead to multiple occasions where even when installing a specific version of the Poetry client, differences in the installed libraries have lead to an inconsistent experience.\r\n\r\n- e.g. #4523\r\n   - which was caused by ongoing releases in `poetry-core` deprecating support for `md5` hashes\r\n- e.g. #4688 \r\n   - which was caused by an update to `cachecontrol`\r\n\r\nIt's quite ironic for a tool which promotes reproducible builds through the use of a lockfile that it should suffer from breakages caused by installing itself via `pip`.\r\n\r\nGiven the purpose of Poetry (and `poetry-core`), it's very likely to be installed and used in a CI pipeline, where stability and reliability are strong concerns. I humbly submit that installing Poetry and `poetry-core` should be a reproducible act for a given version number.\r\n\r\nSuggest that this may be achievable by (preferring the first)\r\n\r\n- Having a `poetry build` mode that outputs a `setup.py` with frozen dependency specifications based on the lock file\r\n   - and using this mode for subsequent releases of `poetry` and `poetry-core`\r\n- Using the output of `pip freeze` for `install-poetry.py` instead of\r\n```python\r\n        if self._git:\r\n            specification = \"git+\" + version\r\n        elif self._path:\r\n            specification = version\r\n        else:\r\n            specification = f\"poetry=={version}\"\r\n\r\n        subprocess.run(\r\n            [str(python), \"-m\", \"pip\", \"install\", specification],\r\n```","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python-poetry/poetry/issues/4689/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":1,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python-poetry/poetry/issues/4689/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python-poetry/poetry/issues/comments/954791015","html_url":"https://github.com/python-poetry/poetry/issues/4688#issuecomment-954791015","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python-poetry/poetry/issues/4688","id":954791015,"node_id":"IC_kwDOB1l16s446PRn","user":{"login":"f0ff886f","id":528239,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyODIzOQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/528239?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/f0ff886f","html_url":"https://github.com/f0ff886f","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/f0ff886f/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/f0ff886f/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/f0ff886f/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/f0ff886f/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/f0ff886f/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/f0ff886f/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/f0ff886f/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/f0ff886f/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/f0ff886f/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-10-29T14:29:02Z","updated_at":"2021-10-29T15:50:10Z","body":"Thank you for finding this out so quickly, we were just in the middle of triaging our CI failing to build anything.

across all versions.\r\n\r\n>Might I humbly suggest that as a tool which promotes stable builds ... that Poetry use some of it's own medicine to install itself, and use a lockfile or output of pip

I've manually triggered builds from Dependabot and Renovate (which both freshly install Poetry either through `pip install` or through `install-poetry.py`) on some projects, and both tools were now

now works as expected.\r\n\r\nIf Poetry was installed during the issue (so with either `0.12.7` or `0.12.8` of `cachecontrol`), I believe that either a `pip install -U cachecontrol` or a
