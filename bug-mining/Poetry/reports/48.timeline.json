symlinks, then the command fails no matter if I provide sdist or wheel, with the same `AssertionError` as originally reported. Somewhere in the process of resolution poetry resolves the path, and then compares 2 objects of type `FileDependency`, where one has a resolved `_dependency.path`, while other doesn't (if path contains one or more symlinks). This causes it to fail because it thinks these two dependencies are different, and therefore this line https://github.com/python-poetry/poetry/blob/05f39efa52deb801800309c6ee8cce7c17f61d49/src/poetry/mixology/partial_solution.py#L150 gives a `None`.\r\n\r\nI should mention that my use case is a testing scenario where the dependency is already present as a normal dependency, but I'm overriding it by \"adding\" a different version of it from a file, as a dev dependency (because adding to normal dependencies from a file is not allowed). This is part of a compatibility testing workflow I'm working on.\r\n\r\nI think the code should be changed somewhere to always resolve path before comparing, maybe `FileDependency` init should be modified (it's in `poetry-core` project), or somewhere else - I'm not sure where the deviation and existing resolving happens so cannot really come up with the best solution.\r\n\r\nFor my use case I have modified my script to resolve the path before calling poetry, which solved the problem for me.","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python-poetry/poetry/issues/comments/1894825765/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"f3flight","id":6680260,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2ODAyNjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6680260?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/f3flight","html_url":"https://github.com/f3flight","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/f3flight/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/f3flight/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/f3flight/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/f3flight/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/f3flight/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/f3flight/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/f3flight/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/f3flight/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/f3flight/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":11505677660,"node_id":"MEE_lADOB1l16s53BrFvzwAAAAKtyrVc","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python-poetry/poetry/issues/events/11505677660","actor":{"login":"dimbleby","id":875184,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg3NTE4NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/875184?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dimbleby","html_url":"https://github.com/dimbleby","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dimbleby/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dimbleby/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dimbleby/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dimbleby/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dimbleby/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dimbleby/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dimbleby/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dimbleby/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dimbleby/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2024-01-17T02:15:13Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":11505677665,"node_id":"SE_lADOB1l16s53BrFvzwAAAAKtyrVh","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python-poetry/poetry/issues/events/11505677665","actor":{"login":"dimbleby","id":875184,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg3NTE4NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/875184?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dimbleby","html_url":"https://github.com/dimbleby","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dimbleby/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dimbleby/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dimbleby/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dimbleby/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dimbleby/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dimbleby/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dimbleby/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dimbleby/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dimbleby/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2024-01-17T02:15:13Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":11505677671,"node_id":"MEE_lADOB1l16s53BrFvzwAAAAKtyrVn","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python-poetry/poetry/issues/events/11505677671","actor":{"login":"aaaaahaaaaa","id":2808155,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4MDgxNTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2808155?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaaaahaaaaa","html_url":"https://github.com/aaaaahaaaaa","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaaaahaaaaa/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaaaahaaaaa/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaaaahaaaaa/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaaaahaaaaa/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaaaahaaaaa/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaaaahaaaaa/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaaaahaaaaa/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaaaahaaaaa/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaaaahaaaaa/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2024-01-17T02:15:13Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":11505677675,"node_id":"SE_lADOB1l16s53BrFvzwAAAAKtyrVr","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/python-p

the warning about an inconsistent lockfile to an error** ([#8737](https://github.com/python-poetry/poetry/pull/8737)).\r\n- Deprecate setting `installer.modern-installation` to `false` ([#8988](https://github.com/python-poetry/poetry/pull/8988)).\r\n- Drop support for `pip<19` ([#8894](https://github.com/python-poetry/poetry/pull/8894)).\r\n- Require `requests-toolbelt>=1`
