is a quick fix to avoid polluting stdout unexpectedly when Poetry's\nenvironment management comes into play.\n\nIt's apparent from how much the complexity of this file has grown that\nthis needs to be refactored moderately, as well as each major class\ndeserving its own source file.\n\nFuture work should also include a rethink of how IO objects are passed\naround the codebase, how we reason about verbosity at a function level,\nand how code is re-used -- one command may wish to output to stdout, but\nif that code is reused by another command, the calculus of what is\ncommand output and what is informative (or even needs to be hidden/shown\nbased on verbosity level) changes.\n\nWork on output would likely have to be fairly comprehensive and\ninvasive, but things have grown complex enough that a top-down design\npass is likely the best route.\n\nRegardless, this is a simple change today, and low risk.
