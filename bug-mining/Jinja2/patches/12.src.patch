+- automatically detect newer Python interpreter versions before loading code
+  from bytecode caches to prevent segfaults on invalid opcodes.  The segfault
+  in earlier Jinja2 versions here was not a Jinja2 bug but a limitation in
+  the underlying Python interpreter.  If you notice Jinja2 segfaulting in
+  earlier versions after an upgrade of the Python interpreter you don't have
+  to upgrade, it's enough to flush the bytecode cache.  This just no longer
+  makes this necessary, Jinja2 will automatically detect these cases now.
