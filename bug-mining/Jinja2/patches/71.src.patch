 for values explicitly marked as safe.  Variables and expressions
 can be marked as safe either in:
 
-a. the context dictionary by the application with `MarkupSafe.Markup`, or
-b. the template, with the `|safe` filter

+b.  The template, with the ``|safe`` filter.
 
-The main problem with this approach is that Python itself doesn't have the
-concept of tainted values; so whether a value is safe or unsafe can get lost.
+If a string that you marked safe is passed through other Python code
+that doesn't understand that mark, it may get lost. Be aware of when
+your data is marked safe and how it is processed before arriving at the
+template.
 
-If a value is not marked safe, auto-escaping will take place; which means that
-you could end up with double-escaped contents.  Double-escaping is easy to
-avoid, however: just rely on the tools Jinja2 provides and *don't use builtin
-Python constructs such as str.format or the string modulo operator (%)*.
+If a value has been escaped but is not marked safe, auto-escaping will
+still take place and result in double-escaped characters. If you know
+you have data that is already safe but not marked, be sure to wrap it in
+``Markup`` or use the ``|safe`` filter.
 
 Jinja2 functions (macros, `super`, `self.BLOCKNAME`) always return template
 data that is marked as safe.
