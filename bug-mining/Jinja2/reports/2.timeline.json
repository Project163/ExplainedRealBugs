undesirable (per car) is an extra empty line before the line '2 spaces before me'.\n\nAs a workaround, to remove the empty line, we can change one line in template string from `{{print_car_review(car)}}` to `{{print_car_review(car)-}}`. This does remove the empty line but it is also (undesirably) removing the beginning spaces from the next line. See the output below\n\nActual Output:\n\n```\nhi there\ncar 'foo with reviews' reviews:\n  Review: good\n2 spaces before me\nEnd of car details\nhi there\ncar 'foo without reviews' reviews:\n2 spaces before me\nEnd of car details\n```\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pallets/jinja/issues/612/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pallets/jinja/issues/612/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":3995573291,"node_id":"MDExOkxvY2tlZEV2ZW50Mzk5NTU3MzI5MQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pallets/jinja/issues/events/3995573291","actor":{"login":"github-actions[bot]","id":41898282,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90NDE4OTgyODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/15368?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/github-actions","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"locked","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-11-13T22:14:20Z","lock_reason":"resolved","performed_via_github_app":null}]
