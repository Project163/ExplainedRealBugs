Could Jinja2 be changed in the future to support the Unicode literal? Our example code would look like this--\n\n```\n{{ u\"{0} is fantastic\".format(user.full_name) }}\n```\n\nThis mirrors what you would likely do in a Python script, which I think is what Jinja2 is going for.\n\nAside: I think you might be wondering what the real use case is for this. Obviously, in the example I've used it would be easy to just write this:\n\n```\n{{ user.full_name }} is fantastic!\n```\n\nOne example of where a unicode literal makes sense is encoding a querystring. For example, imagine we have a mailto link with some default body and subject text, which we want to format. This pattern makes sense:\n\n```\n{% set mailto_dict = {\n    \"body\": \"{0} is fantastic!\".decode(\"utf8\").format(user.full_name),\n    \"subject\": \"And this is some example text! Sincerely, {0}\".decode(\"utf8\").format(business.full_name),\n} %}\n<a href=\"mailto:?{{ mailto_dict|urlencode }}\">Send an email</a>\n```\n\nBut all those `decode(\"utf8\")` are icky. It would be much nicer to use a Unicode literal.\n","closed_by":{"login":"mitsuhiko","id":7396,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjczOTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7396?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mitsuhiko","html_url":"https://github.com/mitsuhiko","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mitsuhiko/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mitsuhiko/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mitsuhiko/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mitsuhiko/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mitsuhiko/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mitsuhiko/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mitsuhiko/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mitsuhiko/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mitsuhiko/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pallets/jinja/issues/392/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pallets/jinja/issues/392/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
