We had a template file with UTF-8 BOM, which causes an exception in jinja2, but this exception can not be processed as expected (i guess it has something to do with the ctypes stuff going on there), all that bubbles up to the IronPython environment is a \"AccessViolationException\". This is true for all other mistakes in the templates too, so finding errors in templates becomes really painfull.\n\nThe problem is caused in debug.py line 313 (brings bad luck doesn' it?): \n             obj.tb_next = ctypes.POINTER(_Traceback)()\n\nBut i dont understand this part of jinja2 ...\n","closed_by":{"login":"mitsuhiko","id":7396,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjczOTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7396?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mitsuhiko","html_url":"https://github.com/mitsuhiko","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mitsuhiko/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mitsuhiko/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mitsuhiko/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mitsuhiko/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mitsuhiko/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mitsuhiko/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mitsuhiko/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mitsuhiko/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mitsuhiko/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pallets/jinja/issues/22/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pallets/jinja/issues/22/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
