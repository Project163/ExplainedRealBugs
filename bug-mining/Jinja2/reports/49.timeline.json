-- I'm not sure that this is a \"bug\" in jinja but the object of ansible's safe_eval() is to turn strings into python data but only if it is safe.  Since Ansible is using jinja2 for \"variables\" the output of jinja is being passed through safe_eval() in order to turn the strings returned by jinja back into typed data (ints, floats, dicts, lists, etc). \r\n\r\nTuples have a literal representation which can be eval()'ed safely.  NamedTuple does not.  So safe_eval() is able to handle jinja2's old groupby output which returned a string representation of a tuple.  It cannot handle the new groupby output which returns a representation of a NamedTuple.\r\n\r\nMy reading of the jinja2 commit message is that the NamedTuple is an implementation to ease the implementation of sorting the output: https://github.com/pallets/jinja/commit/6d356f1bc318a15e8d28176a0f44fcb2578335c0  So it should be possible to convert the NamedTuples into regular tuples post-sort if jinja2 would care to keep compatibility here.","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pallets/jinja/issues/comments/271938562/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"abadger","id":209242,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwOTI0Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/209242?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/abadger","html_url":"https://github.com/abadger","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abadger/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abadger/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abadger/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abadger/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abadger/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abadger/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abadger/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abadger/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abadger/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pallets/jinja/issues/comments/272033655","html_url":"https://github.com/pallets/jinja/issues/654#issuecomment-272033655","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pallets/jinja/issues/654","id":272033655,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI3MjAzMzY1NQ==","user":{"login":"mitsuhiko","id":7396,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjczOTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7396?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mitsuhiko","html_url":"https://github.com/mitsuhiko","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mitsuhiko/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mitsuhiko/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mitsuhiko/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mitsuhiko/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mitsuhiko/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mitsuhiko/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mitsuhiko/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mitsuhiko/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mitsuhiko/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-01-11T23:53:54Z","updated_at":"2017-01-11T23:53:54Z","body":"For what it's worth I ran into the same issue in Jinja2 on the way to fixing the contant folding.
