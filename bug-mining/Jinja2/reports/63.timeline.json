this is merged into master, I'll probably release a 3.0.0a1 so people can start testing early.\r\n\r\n- Remove `_compat` module and other compat code.\r\n- Run [pyupgrade](https://github.com/asottile/pyupgrade), use f-strings everywhere, replace `x and y or z` with `y if x else z`.\r\n- Remove deprecated code from Jinja 2.x.\r\n- Stop building universal wheel.\r\n- Bump bytecode cache version.\r\n- ~I18N doesn't look for `ugettext`.~\r\n- Remove old docs.\r\n\r\nStill have some things left that I'll either hit later or get help with at the PyCascades 2020 sprint:\r\n\r\n- Inline `asyncsupport` instead of patching where possible. Keep in mind performance reasons for patching.\r\n- Refactor compiler to extract some helper functions so things like `\"async for\" if self.is_async else \"for\"`, `Markup if ctx.volatile else str`, etc. aren't written by hand all over the place.\r\n- Use `super` instead of `BaseClass.method` where appropriate.\r\n- Apply pyupgrade and code style fixes to docs.\r\n- Apply pyupgrade and code style
