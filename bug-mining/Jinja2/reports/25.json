This can lead to unexpected behaviour:\n\n``` python\n>>> import jinja2\n>>> jinja2.Template(\"{% macro a(b, c=1, d) %}b={{b}},c={{c}},d={{d}}{% endmacro %} {{ a() }}\").render()\nu' b=,c=,d=1'\n```\n\nHere you can see that the default was applied to parameter `d` instead of `c`. There are two fixes for this: \n- Tie the defaults to the parameter they were defined from\n- Throw a synxtax error like python does: `SyntaxError: non-default argument follows default argument\n  `\n","closed_by":{"login":"untitaker","id":837573,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgzNzU3Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/837573?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/untitaker","html_url":"https://github.com/untitaker","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/untitaker/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/untitaker/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/untitaker/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/untitaker/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/untitaker/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/untitaker/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/untitaker/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/untitaker/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/untitaker/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pallets/jinja/issues/364/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pallets/jinja/issues/364/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
