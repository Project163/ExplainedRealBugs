I switched to an older version of Jinja2 (2.2.1) that the template had previously rendered with and I got this error:\n\n\"/usr/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/Jinja2-2.2.1-py2.7.egg/jinja2/environment.py\",\nline 839, in from_code\n   exec code in namespace\n File \"/var/www/templates/post_alert.html\", line 1, in\n<module>\n   <html>\nTypeError: an integer is required\n\nAnd I also saw the same traceback but with the exception \"ImportError: No module named division\" but I'm not sure how to duplicate that.  My setup uses a FileSystemLoader with a MemcachedBytecodeCache and autoescape=True, auto_reload=True, line_statement_prefix='#'\n\nI had previously been using Python 2.6 to render this template with no problems using Jinja2 2.2.1.\n\nIn any case, my hack to fix this problem was to change the body style:   font:13px/1.5\nto just: font:13px\n","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pallets/jinja/issues/4/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pallets/jinja/issues/4/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
