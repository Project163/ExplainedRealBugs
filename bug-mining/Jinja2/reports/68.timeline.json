It could have a new rule for tuples that recursively prepares the elements:\r\n\r\n```Python\r\ndef prepare(attribute):\r\n    if attribute is None:\r\n        attribute = []\r\n    elif isinstance(attribute, tuple):\r\n        attribute = tuple(prepare(part) for part in attribute)\r\n    elif isinstance(attribute, string_types):\r\n        attribute = [int(x) if x.isdigit() else x for x in attribute.split('.')]\r\n    else:\r\n        attribute = [attribute]\r\n    return attribute\r\n\r\nattribute = prepare(attribute)\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf `attrgetter` detects that a part is a tuple, it can also use recursion to `getitem` each piece separately. The final results will therefore also be a tuple, so we can return `results[0]` when there is only 1 item to keep it backwards compatible. You will only receive a tuple out if you put a tuple in.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nPython itself does not have an answer to the \"one column asc, other column desc\" [question](https://stackoverflow.com/a/16537717) other than negating integers or chaining sorts, so if that doesn't make it into Jinja this would still be a net
