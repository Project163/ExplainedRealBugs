I'm using Jinja2 in a rather underpowered embedded (MIPS24KEc/580 MHz) and I found out startup time (\"import jinja2\") is unacceptably slow (>12sec).\r\n\r\nI traced the bulk of delay to _stringdefs.py / lexer.py specifically to compilation of \"name_re\" regular expression (>10 sec!).\r\nReverting to this to the \"ASCII only\" regex drops time to an acceptable level.\r\n\r\nIF I understand correctly this regex is used to parse identifiers; as such using full Unicode seems overzealous (especially so since it has this large impact).\r\n\r\nWould it be possible to make it a configuration option?\r\nPerhaps making current behavior \"default\" would minimize impact on current users; it would even be possible to think about a \"the-state\" setting with the \"plain ASCII\" as fallback and a \"compromise\" with a few accented letters, but without full blown Unicode (does it even make sense? for identifiers?)\r\n\r\nI also suspect (but I didn't measure) the full blown Unicode regex carries a sizeable runtime penalty with little usability gain.\r\n\r\nI saw #666 and I fully agree with @ThiefMaster that \"IMO using non-ascii chars in identifiers is an awful idea\"; I also understand it's perhaps too late to revert default behavior, but having some config option would be helpful (to avoid directly editing the code).\r\n\r\nIn general this makes me wonder if there are other such \"smart\" trade-offs in the code... did I miss something?\r\n\r\n## Your Environment\r\n* Python version: 3.6.1\r\n* Jinja version:
