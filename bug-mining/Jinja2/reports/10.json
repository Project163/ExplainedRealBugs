See http://code.google.com/p/tipfy-ext-appstats/issues/detail?id=1 for details.\n\nI believe that this is weakly a bug on both sides. Appstats should catch the error, but jinja2 should not throw it when the undefined variable is not being used for in-template display. Thus, I think that **getattr** on runtime.Undefined should raise AttributeError, not UndefinedError, if the attribute is pseudo-private (starts with \"_\"). Here's the temporary patch I'm using starting at line 460 of runtime.py; please check this patch (Am I using @internalcode correctly? Do you agree with my reasoning?) and use it if appropriate:\n\n```\n__add__ = __radd__ = __mul__ = __rmul__ = __div__ = __rdiv__ = \\\n__truediv__ = __rtruediv__ = __floordiv__ = __rfloordiv__ = \\\n__mod__ = __rmod__ = __pos__ = __neg__ = __call__ = \\\n__getitem__ = __lt__ = __le__ = __gt__ = __ge__ = \\\n__int__ = __float__ = __complex__ = __pow__ = __rpow__ = \\\n    _fail_with_undefined_error\n\n@internalcode\ndef __getattr__(self,attr):\n    if attr.startswith(\"_\"):\n        raise AttributeError\n    else:\n        self._fail_with_undefined_error()\n```\n","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pallets/jinja/issues/6/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pallets/jinja/issues/6/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
