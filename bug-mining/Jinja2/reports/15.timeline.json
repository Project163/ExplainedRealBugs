#395 \r\n\r\nI've implemented the functionality requested in issue #395 along with some test cases that cover the code.\r\n\r\nI've made the following decisions that I'd like some feedback on:\r\n\r\n### Renamed {% empty %} -> {% else %}\r\nI've taken the liberty of naming the fail-case \"else\" instead of \"empty\" since I feel like it better conveys the control flow, \"empty\" feels a little ambiguous, at least as someone not familiar with Django. \r\n\r\n### Silently render _else_ case if iterating over undefined variable\r\nAs requested, this functionality also covers the case where you attempt to iterate over an undefined variable, defaulting to the _else_ block, and throwing an error if no _else_ block is defined.\r\n\r\nThis will fail to compile:\r\n```\r\n{% for a in undefined_variable %}\r\n    {{a}}\r\n{% endfor %}\r\n```\r\nand yield the error:  `Tried to iterate undefined container 'undefined_variable'. To treat undefined containers the same as empty ones, explicitly define an {% else %} block within the for loop`\r\n\r\n\r\nThis will render \"hello world\"\r\n```\r\n{% for a in undefined_variable %}\r\n    {{a}}\r\n{% else %}\r\n    hello world\r\n{% endfor %}\r\n```\r\n\r\nI'm unsure of whether this is a good compromise, and if the \"undefined\" case should even be covered by the _else_ case, or if additional checks by the user should be required in that case.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Keats/tera/issues/426/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Keats/tera/issues/426/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"actor":{"login":"ftnext","id":21273221,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMjczMjIx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21273221?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ftnext","html_url":"https://github.com/ftnext","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ftnext/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ftnext/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ftnext/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ftnext/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ftnext/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ftnext/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ftnext/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ftnext/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ftnext/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-07-11T16:35:08Z","updated_at":"2020-07-11T16:35:08Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ftnext/bring-script-more-users/issues/12","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ftnext/bring-script-more-users","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ftnext/bring-script-more-users/issues/12/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ftnext/bring-script-more-users/issues/12/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ftnext/bring-script-more-users/issues/12/events","html_url":"https://github.com/ftnext/bring-script-more-users/issues/12","id":655229064,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU2NTUyMjkwNjQ=","number":12,"title":"Flaskアプリでブラウザからフォルダを選ぶ方法を調査・実装する","user":{"login":"ftnext","id":21273221,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMjczMjIx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21273221?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ftnext","html_url":"https://github.com/ftnext","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ftnext/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ftnext/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ftnext/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ftnext/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ftnext/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ftnext/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ftnext/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ftnext/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ftnext/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":2168902780,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMTY4OTAyNzgw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ftnext/bring-script-more-users/labels/preparation","name":"preparation","color":"554171","default":false,"description":"prepare
