as this has been a dormant issue for quite some time I'm wondering whether there's anything in particular that makes this a tricky issue, say, if I wanted to give it a go?\r\n\r\nI'm fairly sure willkg's own code he's referring to is puente, which is useful and neat, but hasn't been updated in a while. At the same time there's `django_jinja` trying to bridge the gap for Django and Jinja2 users, and both do their own monkey-patching to enhance the extraction of messages, both with their own limitations.\r\n\r\nEither way, what I'm trying to get at is: are there elements holding this back as a possibility? Similarly to Django, would a `trimmed` option be feasible?
