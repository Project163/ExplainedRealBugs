included. Sorry about the newline in README.rst.\n\nThere was a concern that this might not be appropriate for the built-ins. Obviously, I'd argue that it is. Many major projects outside Pocoo (Ansible and Django for example) have written their own filters to do the same job. In my case, our company uses Jinja as a standalone library for our automation tooling and don't get the extras included with applications/frameworks that build on top of Jinja. Since so many devs are doing the same work in their downstream projects to make up for the lack in Jinja, it seems appropriate to simply provide that functionality
