In Python we have this:\n\n> > > 'SOMETHING ELSE'.title()\n> > > 'Something Else'\n\nBut using the tilte filter we get 'SOMETHING ELSE' as the result.\n\nThere's two possible solutions in my opinion. \n\nThe first solution would be change the behavior to match Python's. This would be my choice and the implementation would be as simple as the implementation of the other filters who transform the cases (lower, upper and capitalize). Just a return soft_unicode(s).title().\n\nThe second solution would be change the documentation to state that behavior. In the case this solution is chosen I would try to rename it to something else and make a title filter that behaves like Python's.\n","closed_by":{"login":"mitsuhiko","id":7396,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjczOTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7396?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mitsuhiko","html_url":"https://github.com/mitsuhiko","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mitsuhiko/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mitsuhiko/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mitsuhiko/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mitsuhiko/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mitsuhiko/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mitsuhiko/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mitsuhiko/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mitsuhiko/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mitsuhiko/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pallets/jinja/issues/251/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pallets/jinja/issues/251/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
