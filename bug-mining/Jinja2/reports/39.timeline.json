But calling `.format` with Unicode data [then fails](http://stackoverflow.com/q/3235386/857390).\n\nI can understand the rationale behind using `str` for pure-ASCII string literals, but it would be nice if there was a way to force string literals to Unicode (like Python's `from future import unicode_literals`). The syntax could be similar to that of the [Autoescape extension](http://jinja.pocoo.org/docs/dev/templates/#autoescape-overrides):\n\n```\n{% unicodeliterals true %}\n    {# All string literals are Unicode literals #}\n    {% set foo = \"I'm a unicode literal!\" %}\n{% endunicodeliterals %}\n\n{% unicodeliterals false %}\n    {# Standard behavior (type depends on content) #}\n    {% set bar = \"I'm a str literal!\" %}\n    {% set baz = \"Ünicödë för thë wïn!\" %}\n{% endunicodeliterals %}\n```\n\nAs a workaround you can use the [`format` filter](http://stackoverflow.com/a/21828209/857390) instead. However, it seems that it only supports the old (Python 2) string formatting syntax.\n","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pallets/jinja/issues/comments/199735694/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"torfsen","id":2877717,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4Nzc3MTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2877717?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/torfsen","html_url":"https://github.com/torfsen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/torfsen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/torfsen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/torfsen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/torfsen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/torfsen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/torfsen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/torfsen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/torfsen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/torfsen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pallets/jinja/issues/comments/199868929","html_url":"https://github.com/pallets/jinja/issues/392#issuecomment-199868929","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pallets/jinja/issues/392","id":199868929,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE5OTg2ODkyOQ==","user":{"login":"razor-1","id":2955084,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5NTUwODQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2955084?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/razor-1","html_url":"https://github.com/razor-1","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/razor-1/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/razor-1/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/razor-1/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/razor-1/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/razor-1/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/razor-1/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/razor-1/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/razor-1/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/razor-1/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-03-22T15:34:53Z","updated_at":"2016-03-22T15:34:53Z","body":"@torfsen

However, while they do enforce the correct behavior, these fixes break a lot of other pieces of code which (implicitly) assumed the old behavior.\n\nThe problem is that there seems to be no rule whether `str` or `unicode` are to be used in a given context. Therefore, each part of the code which does string processing and object-to-string conversion needs to make sure it handles both `str` and `unicode` correctly. The errors that pop up after I fixed `__repr__`, etc. show that this is often not done correctly.\n\nBefore spending a lot of time fixing each of these little issues I want to make sure that I'm on the right track concerning how Unicode is handled in CKAN. Correct handling of Unicode in Python 2 is a non-trivial issue, and in my opinion CKAN would benefit greatly from a clear strategy. This is especially true with regard to an eventual migration to Python 3. In particular:\n- What encoding should CKAN Python source files use (see [PEP 263](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0263/))?\n- Do we want to use `unicode_literals` from [`__future__`](https://docs.python.org/2/library/__future__.html)?\n- Do we use `str` or `unicode` internally?\n- In what form do we pass/receive strings to/from Pylons, babel, the file system, etc.?\n\nAre there existing CKAN conventions with regard to this? The documentation only mentions Unicode in a few isolated
