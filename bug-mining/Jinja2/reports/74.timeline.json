it makes sense to format a character in a string literal--\n\n```\n{{ \"{0} is fantastic\".format(user.full_name) }}\n```\n\nHowever, this will fail with a UnicodeEncodeError if user.full_name is a Unicode string with non-ASCII characters in it.\n\nJinja2 does not support unicode string literals, so one must work around this problem like so--\n\n```\n{{ \"{0} is fantastic\".decode(\"utf8\").format(user.full_name) }}\n```\n\nThis is icky. Could Jinja2 be changed in the future to support the Unicode literal? Our example code would look like this--\n\n```\n{{ u\"{0} is fantastic\".format(user.full_name) }}\n```\n\nThis mirrors what you would likely do in a Python script, which I think is what Jinja2 is going for.\n\nAside: I think you might be wondering what the real use case is for this. Obviously, in the example I've used it would be easy to just write this:\n\n```\n{{ user.full_name }} is fantastic!\n```\n\nOne example of where a unicode literal makes sense is encoding a querystring. For example, imagine we have a mailto link with some default body and subject text, which we want to format. This pattern makes sense:\n\n```\n{% set mailto_dict = {\n    \"body\": \"{0} is fantastic!\".decode(\"utf8\").format(user.full_name),\n    \"subject\": \"And this is some example text! Sincerely, {0}\".decode(\"utf8\").format(business.full_name),\n} %}\n<a href=\"mailto:?{{ mailto_dict|urlencode }}\">Send an email</a>\n```\n\nBut all those `decode(\"utf8\")` are icky. It would be much nicer to use a Unicode literal.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pallets/jinja/issues/392/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pallets/jinja/issues/392/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pallets/jinja/issues/comments/230614193","html_url":"https://github.com/pallets/jinja/issues/566#issuecomment-230614193","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pallets/jinja/issues/566","id":230614193,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIzMDYxNDE5Mw==","user":{"login":"bladeoflight16","id":1159076,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTkwNzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1159076?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bladeoflight16","html_url":"https://github.com/bladeoflight16","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bladeoflight16/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bladeoflight16/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bladeoflight16/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bladeoflight16/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bladeoflight16/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bladeoflight16/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bladeoflight16/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bladeoflight16/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bladeoflight16/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-07-05T21:52:57Z","updated_at":"2016-07-05T21:52:57Z","body":"I'm not sure about the wisdom of encouraging the use of the old style `%` formatting mechanism.
