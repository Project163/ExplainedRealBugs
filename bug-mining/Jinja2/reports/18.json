The problem is that the \"**getitem**\" method may mutate the cache, but that method does not acquire the write lock, \"_wlock\".\n\nFor example, here's one scenario:\n- Thread A calls \"getitem\" with the key \"K\".\n- \"K\" is not the last element of the queue, so Thread A removes it.\n- Thread A is suspended before it appends \"K\" to the queue.\n- Thread B calls \"setitem\" with the key \"K\".\n- Thread B finds \"K\" in the \"mapping\" dictionary.\n- Thread B tries to remove \"K\" from the queue.\n- The queue raises an exception, because it does not contain \"K\".\n\nIn my project I've seen the \"**setitem**\" method raise a KeyError.  I assume that there's a similar execution scenario behind those exceptions, but I could be wrong.\n\nIn any case, I think \"**getitem**\" clearly needs to acquire \"_wlock\" before it removes and appends keys.\n","closed_by":{"login":"mitsuhiko","id":7396,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjczOTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7396?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mitsuhiko","html_url":"https://github.com/mitsuhiko","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mitsuhiko/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mitsuhiko/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mitsuhiko/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mitsuhiko/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mitsuhiko/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mitsuhiko/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mitsuhiko/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mitsuhiko/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mitsuhiko/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pallets/jinja/issues/8/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pallets/jinja/issues/8/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
