The Ansible project already uses the `.j2` convention in their docs: http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/template_module.html\n\nAlso, having a convention might make it easier for linters/syntax highlighters to auto-pickup on the file type, I'd be curious to hear from @danielchatfield if this would have made it easier to write https://github.com/danielchatfield/atom-jinja2\n\nThat said, this is just my personal opinion.

Had someone ask about why our system wasn't automatically highlighting jinja2 files and noticed there were no extensions mapped for this mode.
