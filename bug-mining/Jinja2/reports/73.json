Jinja can generate any text-based format (HTML, XML, CSV, LaTeX, etc.). A Jinja template doesn’t need to have a specific extension: .html, .xml, or any other extension is just fine.\n\nWhile this is all true, I think it implies a bad recommendation, and makes things harder for the ecosystem around Jinja2. I think Jinja2 should recommend (but not require) a single file extension for Jinja2 templates.\n\nA Jinja2 template for an HTML file is not the same thing as an HTML file. The Jinja2 template may not even be valid HTML until rendered, and it certainly shouldn't be syntax highlighted as simply HTML, or served by a static-files web server as `text/html`. It is a distinct type of file, and deserves its own file extension to indicate that.\n\nPersonally, I use the `.j2` extension, and I often \"stack\" extensions to indicate what the intended type of the rendered template is; e.g. `foo.html.j2` is \"a Jinja2 template that will be an HTML file when rendered.\" (This is inspired by existing precedent for stacked extensions, e.g. `.tar.gz` is a \"a gzip file that will be a tar file when unzipped\").\n\nI would be happy to put together a small pull request for the documentation recommending this approach (while still making it clear that Jinja2 itself enforces no such convention), if the concept is accepted.\n","closed_by":{"login":"davidism","id":1242887,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNDI4ODc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1242887?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidism","html_url":"https://github.com/davidism","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidism/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidism/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidism/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidism/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidism/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidism/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidism/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidism/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidism/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pallets/jinja/issues/547/reactions","total_count":8,"+1":7,"-1":1,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pallets/jinja/issues/547/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
