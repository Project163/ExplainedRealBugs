This will be the last version to support Python 2.7 and 3.5.</li>\n<li>Added a new <code>ChainableUndefined</code> class to support getitem and getattr on an undefined object. 977</li>\n<li>Allow <code>{%+</code> syntax (with NOP behavior) when <code>lstrip_blocks</code> is disabled. 748</li>\n<li>Added a <code>default</code> parameter for the <code>map</code> filter. 557</li>\n<li>Exclude environment globals from meta.find_undeclared_variables. 931</li>\n<li>Float literals can be written with scientific notation, like 2.56e-3. 912, 922</li>\n<li>Int and float literals can be written with the '_' separator for legibility, like 12_345. 923</li>\n<li>Fix a bug causing deadlocks in <code>LRUCache.setdefault</code>. 1000</li>\n<li>The <code>trim</code> filter takes an optional string of characters to trim. 828</li>\n<li>A new <code>jinja2.ext.debug</code> extension adds a <code>{% debug %}</code> tag to quickly dump the current context and available filters and tests. 174, 798, 983</li>\n<li>Lexing templates with large amounts of whitespace is much faster. 857, 858</li>\n<li>Parentheses around comparisons are preserved, so <code>{{ 2 * (3 &lt; 5) }}</code> outputs &quot;2&quot; instead of &quot;False&quot;. 755, 938</li>\n<li>Add new <code>boolean</code>, <code>false</code>, <code>true</code>, <code>integer</code> and <code>float</code> tests. 824</li>\n<li>The environment's <code>finalize</code> function is only applied to the output of expressions (constant or not), not static template data. 63</li>\n<li>When providing multiple paths to <code>FileSystemLoader</code>, a template can have the same name as a directory. 821</li>\n<li>Always return Undefined when omitting the <code>else</code> clause in a <code>{{ 'foo' if bar }}</code> expression, regardless of the environment's <code>undefined</code> class. Omitting the <code>else</code> clause is a valid shortcut and should not raise an error when using StrictUndefined. 710, 1079</li>\n<li>Fix behavior of <code>loop</code> control variables such as <code>length</code> and <code>revindex0</code> when looping over a generator. 459, 751, 794, 993</li>\n<li>Async support is only loaded the first time an environment enables it, in order to avoid a slow initial import. 765</li>\n<li>In async environments, the <code>|map</code> filter will await the filter call if needed. 913</li>\n<li>In for loops that access <code>loop</code> attributes, the iterator is not advanced ahead of the current iteration unless <code>length</code>, <code>revindex</code>, <code>nextitem</code>, or <code>last</code> are accessed. This makes it less likely to break <code>groupby</code> results. 555, 1101</li>\n<li>In async environments, the <code>loop</code> attributes <code>length</code> and <code>revindex</code> work for async iterators. 1101</li>\n<li>In async environments, values from attribute/property access will be awaited if needed. 1101</li>\n<li>~loader.PackageLoader doesn't depend on setuptools or pkg_resources. 970</li>\n<li><code>PackageLoader</code> has limited support for 420 namespace packages. 1097</li>\n<li>Support os.PathLike objects in ~loader.FileSystemLoader and ~loader.ModuleLoader. 870</li>\n<li>~nativetypes.NativeTemplate correctly handles quotes between expressions. <code>&quot;'{{ a }}', '{{ b }}'&quot;</code> renders as the tuple <code>('1', '2')</code> rather than the string <code>'1, 2'</code>. 1020</li>\n<li>Creating a ~nativetypes.NativeTemplate directly creates a ~nativetypes.NativeEnvironment instead of a default Environment. 1091</li>\n<li>After calling <code>LRUCache.copy()</code>, the copy's queue methods point to the correct queue. 843</li>\n<li>Compiling templates always writes UTF-8 instead of defaulting to the system encoding. 889</li>\n<li><code>|wordwrap</code> filter treats existing newlines as separate paragraphs to be wrapped individually, rather than creating short intermediate lines. 175</li>\n<li>Add <code>break_on_hyphens</code> parameter to <code>|wordwrap</code> filter. 550</li>\n<li>Cython compiled functions decorated as context functions will be passed the context. 1108</li>\n<li>When chained comparisons of constants are evaluated at compile time, the result follows Python's behavior of returning <code>False</code> if any comparison returns <code>False</code>, rather than only the last one. 1102</li>\n<li>Tracebacks for exceptions in templates show the correct line numbers and source for Python &gt;= 3.7. 1104</li>\n<li>Tracebacks for template syntax errors in Python 3 no longer show internal compiler frames. 763</li>\n<li>Add a <code>DerivedContextReference</code> node that can be used by extensions to get the current context and local variables such as <code>loop</code>. 860</li>\n<li>Constant folding during compilation is applied to some node types that were previously overlooked. 733</li>\n<li><code>TemplateSyntaxError.source</code> is not empty when raised from an included template. 457</li>\n</ul>\n</tr></table> ...
