the following code the result depends on atoescaping even though there are no characters which need escaping. Am I understanding atoescaping incorrectly?\r\nIf you set `autoescape=False` it works as expected.\r\n\r\nThere is a workaround (inspired by https://github.com/pallets/jinja/issues/486). I consider it a bug as it is exactly what the OP of https://github.com/pallets/jinja/issues/486 wanted to achieve from filtering.\r\n\r\nThe goal is to process (with a filter) whatever is inside the block assignment and store it to a variable. The filter is responsible for parsing the content and coercing it to a correct type (bool, number, string, lists).
