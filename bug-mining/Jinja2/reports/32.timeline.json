problem:**\r\n\r\nPytest uses old-style classes everywhere. E.g.,\r\n\r\n```\r\nclass MarkGenerator:\r\n    ………\r\n\r\nclass MarkDecorator:\r\n    ………\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis causes unexpected behaviour in some cases. For example, when trying to get an item from a mark, `AttributeError` is raised (as in the old-style classes) instead of `TypeError` (as in the new-style classes).\r\n\r\nThe old-style classes are long deprecated, and the modern libraries & young developers do not expect this weird behaviour in their code anymore. This causes errors when trying to integrate pytest with other libraries & frameworks. For instance, in Jinja template engine (pallets/jinja#631); but there may be other cases.\r\n\r\n**The solution:**\r\n\r\nIt would be nice if all classes would be new-style classes, i.e. explicitly inheriting from `object`:\r\n\r\n```\r\nclass MarkGenerator(object):\r\n    ………\r\n\r\nclass MarkDecorator(object):\r\n    ………\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Possible problems:**\r\n\r\nThis will probably break the compatibility with python < 2.7 (officially 2.6+ is declared for pytest).\r\n\r\nAlso, in python3, the no-braces syntax is a new normal (again), but causes the new-style classes with implicit inheritance from `object`. The 2.7's new-style syntax is supported.\r\n\r\nSo, explicit mentioning of `(object)` may be of use for python2.7 only. Hence, it should be discussed is it worth changing the code for this case.\r\n\r\n**Notes:**\r\n\r\nPython 2.7.10.\r\npytest==3.0.3\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2147/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2147/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":908399845,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50OTA4Mzk5ODQ1","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pallets/jinja/issues/events/908399845","actor":{"login":"mitsuhiko","id":7396,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjczOTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7396?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mitsuhiko","html_url":"https://github.com/mitsuhiko","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mitsuhiko/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mitsuhiko/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mitsuhiko/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mitsuhiko/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mitsuhiko/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mitsuhiko/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mitsuhiko/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mitsuhiko/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mitsuhiko/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":"0ea221f53b2df44b9d02aec00ff7f87424971d4e","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pallets/jinja/commits/0ea221f53b2df44b9d02aec00ff7f87424971d4e","created_at":"2016-12-30T23:47:24Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3995459772,"node_id":"MDExOkxvY2tlZEV2ZW50Mzk5NTQ1OTc3Mg==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pallets/jinja/issues/events/3995459772","actor":{"login":"github-actions[bot]","id":41898282,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90NDE4OTgyODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/15368?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/github-actions","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"locked","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-11-13T21:34:25Z","lock_reason":"resolved","performed_via_github_app":null}]
