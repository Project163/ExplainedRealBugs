to clarify (after further testing), without the fix described above the arguments to a custom filter are passed in the wrong order when the filter is called on a static string.\n\nFor example, given a filter named myFilter (that is decorated with `@environmentfilter`):\n\n`{{ \"someText\"|myFilter }}` will cause:\n\nThe static string \"someText\" to be passed as the **_first_** argument to myFilter\nThe Jinja environment to be passed as the **_second_** argument to myFilter\n\nOn the other hand, if the filter is called on Jinja data, the behavior is different / is as documented:\n\n`{{ data.someValue|myFilter }}` will cause:\n\nThe Jinja environment to be passed in as the first argument to myFilter\nThe value of data.someValue to be passed in as the second argument to myFilter\n\nThe fix described above corrects the behavior when calling the filter on a static string:  the Jinja environment is passed to the filter as the first argument, and the static string is passed as the second argument.\n","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pallets/jinja/issues/comments/203784933/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"DavidRueter","id":5694184,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2OTQxODQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5694184?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/DavidRueter","html_url":"https://github.com/DavidRueter","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DavidRueter/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DavidRueter/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DavidRueter/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DavidRueter/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DavidRueter/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DavidRueter/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DavidRueter/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DavidRueter/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DavidRueter/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":751835686,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDc1MTgzNTY4Ng==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pallets/jinja/issues/events/751835686","actor":{"login":"DavidRueter","id":5694184,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2OTQxODQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5694184?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/DavidRueter","html_url":"https://github.com/DavidRueter","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DavidRueter/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DavidRueter/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DavidRueter/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DavidRueter/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DavidRueter/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DavidRueter/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DavidRueter/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DavidRueter/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DavidRueter/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"52d58b9a3e72c72b32fd135bec44ed05c04c8abe","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DavidRueter/jinja/commits/52d58b9a3e72c72b32fd135bec44ed05c04c8abe","created_at":"2016-08-10T19:50:34Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":914654239,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDkxNDY1NDIzOQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pallets/jinja/issues/events/914654239","actor":{"login":"mitsuhiko","id":7396,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjczOTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7396?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mitsuhiko","html_url":"https://github.com/mitsuhiko","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mitsuhiko/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mitsuhiko/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mitsuhiko/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mitsuhiko/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mitsuhiko/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mitsuhiko/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mitsuhiko/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mitsuhiko/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mitsuhiko/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"fa2d955542b36ca8a9e863e1145a3d4ac17d1c34","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pallets/jinja/commits/fa2d955542b36ca8a9e863e1145a3d4ac17d1c34","created_at":"2017-01-06T22:08:20Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":914654598,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50OTE0NjU0NTk4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pallets/jinja/issues/events/914654598","actor":{"login":"mitsuhiko","id":7396,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjczOTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7396?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mitsuhiko","html_url":"https://github.com/mitsuhiko","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mitsuhiko/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mitsuhiko/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mitsuhiko/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mitsuhiko/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mitsuhiko/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mitsuhiko/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mitsuhiko/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mitsuhiko/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mitsuhiko/received_events","ty
