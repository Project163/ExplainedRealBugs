Workarounds using e.g. the functions from the `operator` module become quite unreadable, so I really need to make this work.)\n\nI did not find any way to configure this, so I presume it is a limitation in Jinja2. (If anyone can point me in the right direction I'll have a go at a patch.)\n","closed_by":{"login":"niklasl","id":29803,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5ODAz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/29803?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/niklasl","html_url":"https://github.com/niklasl","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/niklasl/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/niklasl/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/niklasl/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/niklasl/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/niklasl/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/niklasl/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/niklasl/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/niklasl/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/niklasl/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pallets/jinja/issues/297/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pallets/jinja/issues/297/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
