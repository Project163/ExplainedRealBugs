string formatting mechanism](https://docs.python.org/2/library/stdtypes.html#string-formatting). The **`format` method**, on the other hand, doesn't even come from jinja2, but is a built-in method of `str` and `unicode` objects in Python, and used for the [new string formatting mechanism](https://docs.python.org/2/library/stdtypes.html#str.format).\n\nIn Python, the new mechanism is preferred over the old one, but in jinja2 we like to maintain a stable API.
