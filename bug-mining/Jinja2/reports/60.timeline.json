Issue\r\n\r\nCreate a pillar with the above content and assign it to a minion. After that, try to list the pillar items of a minion:\r\n\r\n```\r\nsalt 'minion1' pillar.items\r\n```\r\nThe error will be raise. After that, remove the last ``elif`` line (for example):\r\n\r\n```\r\n{% elif grains['id'] == 'server98' %}\r\n```\r\nThe sls is compiled.\r\n\r\n### Versions Report\r\n(Provided by running `salt --versions-report`.
