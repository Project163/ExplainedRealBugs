don't think this is quite right yet. It seems that `loop.length` is off by one with reversed lists of length > 1. Example:\n\n``` python\nimport jinja2\n\nl = [0, 1, 2]\ntemplate_forward = jinja2.Template('{% for i in l %}{{ loop.length }} {% endfor %}')\ntemplate_reverse = jinja2.Template('{% for i in l|reverse %}{{ loop.length }} {% endfor %}')\nprint(template_forward.render(l=l))\nprint(template_reverse.render(l=l))\n```\n\nprints:\n\n```\n2 2 2\n3 3 3\n```\n\nIt should be `3 3 3` both times as the list clearly has three items in it.\n","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pallets/jinja/issues/comments/48139754/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"bradjc","id":1467890,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0Njc4OTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1467890?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bradjc","html_url":"https://github.com/bradjc","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bradjc/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bradjc/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bradjc/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bradjc/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bradjc/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bradjc/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bradjc/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bradjc/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bradjc/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pallets/jinja/issues/comments/48143106","html_url":"https://github.com/pallets/jinja/issues/244#issuecomment-48143106","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pallets/jinja/issues/244","id":48143106,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ4MTQzMTA2","user":{"login":"lazka","id":991986,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk5MTk4Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/991986?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lazka","html_url":"https://github.com/lazka","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lazka/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lazka/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lazka/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lazka/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lazka/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lazka/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lazka/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lazka/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lazka/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-07-07T05:52:35Z","updated_at":"2014-07-07T05:53:08Z","body":"Are you sure you are using current trunk?
