It is only `div` that causes a problem. In `jinja2.compiler`, the line `from __future__ import division` is written into the template code, causing `/` to mean `truediv`. Therefore, overloading must be done with `__truediv__` and not `__div__` (which is [rendered meaningless](http://docs.python.org/2/library/operator.html#operator.__div__) by that import).\n\nIt's probably unfair to call this a bug in Jinja2 then. It was quite unexpected, but the root of that was the warped meaning of division in Python. Studying how Jinja2 handles division closely and actually grooking div overloading details here finally saved me. For robustness, libraries using operator overloading should take the details around division into account.\n\nThus, I'll close this issue. It may still be good to document this detail explicitly though.\n","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pallets/jinja/issues/comments/34714785/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"niklasl","id":29803,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5ODAz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/29803?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/niklasl","html_url":"https://github.com/niklasl","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/niklasl/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/niklasl/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/niklasl/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/niklasl/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/niklasl/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/niklasl/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/niklasl/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/niklasl/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/niklasl/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":92403218,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50OTI0MDMyMTg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pallets/jinja/issues/events/92403218","actor":{"login":"Naddiseo","id":115951,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTk1MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/115951?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Naddiseo","html_url":"https://github.com/Naddiseo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Naddiseo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Naddiseo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Naddiseo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Naddiseo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Naddiseo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Naddiseo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Naddiseo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Naddiseo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Naddiseo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2014-02-11T00:31:10Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":92403219,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDkyNDAzMjE5","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pallets/jinja/issues/events/92403219","actor":{"login":"Naddiseo","id":115951,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTk1MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/115951?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Naddiseo","html_url":"https://github.com/Naddiseo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Naddiseo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Naddiseo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Naddiseo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Naddiseo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Naddiseo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Naddiseo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Naddiseo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Naddiseo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Naddiseo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2014-02-11T00:31:10Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":92403220,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50OTI0MDMyMjA=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pallets/jinja/issues/events/92403220","actor":{"login":"niklasl","id":29803,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5ODAz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/29803?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/niklasl","html_url":"https://github.com/niklasl","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/niklasl/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/niklasl/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/niklasl/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/niklasl/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/niklasl/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/niklasl/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/niklasl/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/niklasl/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/niklasl/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2014-02-11T00:31:10Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3995514968,"node_id":"MDExOkxvY2tlZEV2ZW50Mzk5NTUxNDk2OA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pallets/jinja/issues/events/3995514968","actor":{"login":"github-actions[bot]","id":41898282,"no
