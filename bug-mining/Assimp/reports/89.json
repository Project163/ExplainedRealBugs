It causes loads of warnings which are treated as errors. When the option \"Treat warnign as error\" is turned off in project configuration, there are still loads of (real) errors left, mainly in PugiXML. To sum it up: assimp does not compile.\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\nSteps to reproduce the behavior:\r\nEnvironment is VisualStudio 2019, cmake is used to generate project and solution files and option ASSIMP_DOUBLE_PRECISION is set in order to get higher accuracy.\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nThe code should compile with may be a few warnings\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"kimkulling","id":2323156,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMjMxNTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2323156?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimkulling","html_url":"https://github.com/kimkulling","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimkulling/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimkulling/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimkulling/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimkulling/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimkulling/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimkulling/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimkulling/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimkulling/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimkulling/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assimp/assimp/issues/3682/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assimp/assimp/issues/3682/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
