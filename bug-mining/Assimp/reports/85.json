Currently if this is violated Assimp will crash since it still parses the file. So if only TEXCOORD_1 is given for example, it will still try to use the accessor for TEXCOORD_0 and crash.\r\n\r\nThis happens in glTF2Importer::ImportMeshes where the texture coordinates are processed. I think the import should fail if this is encountered since such a file does not meet the glTF 2.0 specification.\r\n\r\nWill have a quick look and see if I can do a pull request for a fix.\r\n\r\nHere is an intentionally corrupted glTF file which reproduces the issue.\r\n[texcoord_crash.zip](https://github.com/assimp/assimp/files/4750145/texcoord_crash.zip)\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"kimkulling","id":2323156,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMjMxNTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2323156?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimkulling","html_url":"https://github.com/kimkulling","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimkulling/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimkulling/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimkulling/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimkulling/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimkulling/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimkulling/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimkulling/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimkulling/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimkulling/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assimp/assimp/issues/3269/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assimp/assimp/issues/3269/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
