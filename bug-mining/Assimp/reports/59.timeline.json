Convert to .glb for via  .\\assimp.exe export \"duck.dae\" \"output.glb\" -embtex\r\n3. In the official [Validator ](https://github.khronos.org/glTF-Validator/)can see the following error message \"Invalid MIME type 'image/bmp' for the texture source. Valid MIME types are ('image/jpeg', 'image/png').\",\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nValid .gltf/.glb after converting.\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\n@Abde5 Suggested: \"Exporting to glTF from many file formats i.e. the test models with tga/bmp textures do not work well in some viewers.
