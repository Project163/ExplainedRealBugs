Also has a camera in the scene.\n\nThe camera has an aspect ratio of 640, which in my mind is not valid.\nAlso the horizontalFOV is 0.0174532924, which is also not valid.\n\nWhen I skip using these values in my importer and use 3.14f / 4.0f radians for fov, and 1.3f for aspect ratio, the model renders correctly.\n\nSo it would seem that there is a bug in the camera loading code.
