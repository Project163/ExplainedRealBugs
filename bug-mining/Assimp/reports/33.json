While this is not strictly incorrect it is inefficient since among other things it wastes one register on 32-bit x86 which really doesn't have any to spare.\n\nThis is a Linux-only problem since Windows doesn't use PIC.\n\nProbably in top-level CMakeLists.txt the condition on line 65 needs to change but I'm not entirely sure how.\n","closed_by":{"login":"kimkulling","id":2323156,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMjMxNTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2323156?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimkulling","html_url":"https://github.com/kimkulling","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimkulling/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimkulling/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimkulling/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimkulling/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimkulling/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimkulling/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimkulling/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimkulling/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimkulling/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assimp/assimp/issues/634/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assimp/assimp/issues/634/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
