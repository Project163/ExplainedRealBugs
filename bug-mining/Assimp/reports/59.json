However, the resulting GLB files still have references to an external texture files.  Is there a flag I can set when doing the export that will \"bundle up\" the textures into the GLB?  \r\n\r\nFor instance, when I convert the Collada duck model in the assimp models folder to a GLB2, the resulting GLB2 still references duckCM.tga.   I have reviewed the various post processing flags that are available, but there doesn't seem to be one that achieves this.\r\n\r\nThe command I am running:\r\n\r\nassimp export C:\\Users\\Scott\\Downloads\\assimp-4.1.0\\test\\models\\Collada\\duck.dae C:\\Users\\Scott\\Pictures\\duck.glb -fglb2\r\n\r\nIs this not a supported scenario with assimp?
