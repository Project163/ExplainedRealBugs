folks\n\nInternally, Assimp uses an aiMatrix4x4 to store rotations between animation keyframes, before later decomposing into a quaternion.\n\nUnfortunately, quaternions and rotation matrices are only appropriate for representing orientation, and not rotation.\n\nHere is the problem:\n\nKEYFRAME\nTime index: 0.0000000\nRotateZ.ANGLE:  1080\n\nKEYFRAME\nTime index: 1.0000000\nRotateZ.ANGLE:  1440\n\nBecause both 1080 and 1440 are multiples of 360, a rotation matrix and a quaternion treats them as zero, and no animation occurs.\n\nFor the purposes of animation, we need to represent _rotation_ and NOT just _orientation_.\n\nIn order to repair this issue, I believe that we need to stop using quaternions and the internal matrix to handle rotations in keyframes.\n\nInstead, perhaps AxisAngle notation could be used?\n\nHere is a test model which exhibits this problem:\nhttps://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/29850039/Array%20Test%20001.zip\n","closed_by":{"login":"acgessler","id":908209,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkwODIwOQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/908209?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/acgessler","html_url":"https://github.com/acgessler","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/acgessler/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/acgessler/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/acgessler/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/acgessler/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/acgessler/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/acgessler/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/acgessler/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/acgessler/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/acgessler/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assimp/assimp/issues/458/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assimp/assimp/issues/458/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
