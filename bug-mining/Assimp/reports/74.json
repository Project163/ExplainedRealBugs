When creating a test case to reproduce I also seem to see more general UV corruption.\r\n\r\nI've attached a simple OBJ file with a UV test pattern. To reproduce convert to glTF using the assimp.exe program like so:\r\n\r\n`assimp export box.obj box.gltf`\r\n\r\nIn 4.1.0 I see the correct result, like this:\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5742686/67066561-d6b86600-f1be-11e9-9b38-87f682700d19.png)\r\n\r\nHowever in 5.0.0 I am getting this:\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5742686/67066575-e3d55500-f1be-11e9-9227-c8ae39197939.png)\r\n\r\nI'm not sure why this one shows corruption rather than a simple flip of the V component which is what I see on more complex models.\r\n\r\nThere is explicit code for flipping the V component in the exporter, which is correct since that is required for glTF, however that code has not changed between the versions tested above and a quick look through the diffs doesn't reveal anything obvious that would cause this.\r\n\r\n[box.zip](https://github.com/assimp/assimp/files/3742351/box.zip)\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"kimkulling","id":2323156,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMjMxNTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2323156?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimkulling","html_url":"https://github.com/kimkulling","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimkulling/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimkulling/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimkulling/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimkulling/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimkulling/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimkulling/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimkulling/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimkulling/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimkulling/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assimp/assimp/issues/2718/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assimp/assimp/issues/2718/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
