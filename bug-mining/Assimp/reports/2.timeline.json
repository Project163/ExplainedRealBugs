Files to follow in a pull-request.\n\n---\n\nAttached are the files with the changes I made to get pyassimp working on 64-bit Python 3.3.\n\n64-bit Compatibility:\n- The first four characters of a String material property would be cut off. A String's length is defined in structs.py as a c_size_t variable, which is 8 bytes wide on 64-bit Python. However, when an aiString is used as an aiMaterial property in C/C++, the length is truncated down to a 4-byte value on 64-bit machines (see MaterialSystem.cpp aiMaterial::AddProperty() for details). A new struct was declared in structs.py (MaterialPropertyString) and used in core._get_properties().\n\nPython 3.3 Compatibility:\n- The built-in function hasattr() changed in Python 3.2 to not trap exceptions, which means a NULL pointer ValueException now escaped when checking if a pointer was valid (hasattr(obj, 'contents') in core.call_init()) (see http://bugs.python.org/issue9666 for details). A new helper function was defined that preserves the legacy functionality of trapping the exceptions (helper.hasattr_silent()) and used throughout the code as a replacement for hasattr().\n- String objects would import as \"bytes\" rather than as a string. This was most noticeable in the key names for material properties, where the trailing ' of a bytes object would remain after it was converted to a string. The solution was to call decode() on the bytes object using utf-8 decoding. This applies to various parts of core.py.\n\nThe last change made to the Python section of the git repository was a month ago, so these should all still be applicable. This was tested with just a simple .obj file and pyassimp's included sample.py script, so it may not be comprehensive. Also, the changes may not be 100% compatible with Python 2.x, depending on how far back they want to support.\n","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assimp/assimp/issues/comments/18827455/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"severin-lemaignan","id":385379,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4NTM3OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/385379?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/severin-lemaignan","html_url":"https://github.com/severin-lemaignan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/severin-lemaignan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/severin-lemaignan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/severin-lemaignan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/severin-lemaignan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/severin-lemaignan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/severin-lemaignan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/severin-lemaignan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/severin-lemaignan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/severin-lemaignan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":51100031,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDUxMTAwMDMx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assimp/assimp/issues/events/51100031","actor":{"login":"severin-lemaignan","id":385379,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4NTM3OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/385379?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/severin-lemaignan","html_url":"https://github.com/severin-lemaignan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/severin-lemaignan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/severin-lemaignan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/severin-lemaignan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/severin-lemaignan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/severin-lemaignan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/severin-lemaignan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/severin-lemaignan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/severin-lemaignan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/severin-lemaignan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"249460892710b656ec9adde40deb036c0d2221c7","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/severin-lemaignan/assimp/commits/249460892710b656ec9adde40deb036c0d2221c7","created_at":"2013-06-03T08:41:47Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"actor":{"login":"severin-lemaignan","id":385379,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4NTM3OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/385379?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/severin-lemaignan","html_url":"https://github.com/severin-lemaignan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/severin-lemaignan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/severin-lemaignan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/severin-lemaignan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/severin-lemaignan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/severin-lemaignan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/severin-lemaignan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/severin-lemaignan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/severin-lemaignan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/severin-lemaignan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2013-06-03T08:42:59Z","updated_at":"2013-06-03T08:42:59Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assimp/assimp/issues/49","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assimp/assimp","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assimp/assimp/issues/49/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assimp/assimp/issues/49/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assimp/assimp/issues/49/events","html_url":"https://github.com/assimp/assimp/pull/49","id":15056762,"node_id":"MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0NjA3MTg5OQ==","number":49,"title":"[pyassimp]
