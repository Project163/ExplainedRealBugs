I suppose it could be an importer property? \r\n- An env var based approach is fine with me but given that I just hacked in #3834, I'm a little wary to continue that pattern. Ya know, slippery slope and all.\r\n\r\nOr, I could just deal with the file being always written, and do nothing here. \r\n\r\nOr it could be the case that nobody cares about this file any more and so it can be disabled by default or always.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nAny thoughts? I guess the fundamental open questions are:\r\n\r\n1. Is this file still needed at all?\r\n2. If so, is it better to have it be enabled by default, or disabled by default?\r\n3. Where is the most convenient place to stick the option (so that it is as transparent as possible to application developers)?","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assimp/assimp/issues/comments/832801514/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"JC3","id":5651184,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTExODQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5651184?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JC3","html_url":"https://github.com/JC3","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JC3/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JC3/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JC3/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JC3/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JC3/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JC3/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JC3/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JC3/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JC3/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assimp/assimp/issues/comments/832971758","html_url":"https://github.com/assimp/assimp/issues/3886#issuecomment-832971758","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assimp/assimp/issues/3886","id":832971758,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDgzMjk3MTc1OA==","user":{"login":"krishty","id":51880096,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxODgwMDk2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/51880096?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/krishty","html_url":"https://github.com/krishty","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/krishty/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/krishty/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/krishty/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/krishty/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/krishty/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/krishty/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/krishty/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/krishty/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/krishty/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-05-05T20:05:19Z","updated_at":"2021-05-05T20:05:19Z","body":"`DumpToFile();` looks like a code path you’d selectively enable during very specific debugging, but you’d never push that call into the official repo.
