If only a single material is present and there are no lights and no cameras, the postprocessor does *not* add a child node to the root for it -- instead, it puts the mesh directly in the root node:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/assimp/assimp/blob/21d7085be6b7a3c6912ce33d9931688dc1a4a6dc/code/PostProcessing/PretransformVertices.cpp#L611-L617\r\n\r\nThis difference is significant for edge-ish cases like #3816 (where scenes imported with one material, no cameras, no lights, [e.g. most basic scenes or scenes with components removed on import] and `aiProcess_PreTransformVertices` set can't be exported to 3MF without applying the workaround there).\r\n\r\nI don't know if this should be considered a documentation error, or an implementation error. However, while there is something to be said for having the implementation output a 100% consistent structure regardless of the material count, I'm going to think of it as a documentation error, because doing extra work sucks 😁. \r\n\r\nI'll submit a correction in a moment.","closed_by":{"login":"kimkulling","id":2323156,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMjMxNTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2323156?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimkulling","html_url":"https://github.com/kimkulling","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimkulling/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimkulling/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimkulling/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimkulling/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimkulling/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimkulling/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimkulling/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimkulling/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimkulling/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assimp/assimp/issues/3820/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assimp/assimp/issues/3820/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
