we please get rid of the older VS compilers, we should not support these anymore as we have in more than one case had to update code to support their issues?\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n- https://github.com/assimp/assimp/issues/2423\r\n- https://github.com/assimp/assimp/issues/2678\r\n\r\nIt decreases code quality and our tests obviously can't catch the flaws in the compilers, If projects do not support modern compilation suites or tool-chains that is not our problem.\r\n\r\nThe modern VS compiler is better at handling templates etc, so I don't see any practical need to keep having to workaround it's issues when the devs can update their toolchain to fix the bugs with C++11.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assimp/assimp/issues/2735/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assimp/assimp/issues/2735/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
