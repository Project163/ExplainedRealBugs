Furthermore, it never reports any errors. On closer inspection, the whole importer appears to be mostly unimplemented placeholder code ([source](https://github.com/assimp/assimp/blob/21d7085be6b7a3c6912ce33d9931688dc1a4a6dc/code/AssetLib/X3D/X3DImporter.cpp)). \r\n\r\nThis appears to be a regression. As far as I can tell, the X3D importer works fine in the 5.0.1 release on the releases page.\r\n\r\nIn any case, if it's no longer implemented for some reason, it shouldn't be returned in the enumeration of available importers. Also, if it *is* going to be included, it should probably return a failure status and an error message.\r\n\r\nThis also explains why `ReadFile` doesn't fail in #3786.\r\n\r\nSuggested fix: Do not register the X3D importer until it is reimplemented.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assimp/assimp/issues/3815/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assimp/assimp/issues/3815/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"actor":{"login":"kimkulling","id":2323156,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMjMxNTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2323156?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimkulling","html_url":"https://github.com/kimkulling","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimkulling/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimkulling/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimkulling/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimkulling/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimkulling/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimkulling/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimkulling/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimkulling/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimkulling/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-04-27T22:02:48Z","updated_at":"2021-04-27T22:02:48Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assimp/assimp/issues/3814","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assimp/assimp","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assimp/assimp/issues/3814/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assimp/assimp/issues/3814/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assimp/assimp/issues/3814/events","html_url":"https://github.com/assimp/assimp/issues/3814","id":867221696,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU4NjcyMjE2OTY=","number":3814,"title":"X3D

Meaning: If a node is named with DEF, none of its children (recursively) may have the same name, i.e. a node can't have the same name as any of its ancestors.\r\n\r\nThe X3D exporter appears to use aiMesh::mName as a prefix for the node name in Shape nodes. \r\n\r\nWhen the mesh name is empty, it produces Shape nodes such as:\r\n\r\n```\r\n<Shape DEF='_IDX_0'>\r\n    <Appearance DEF='_IDX_0'>\r\n        ...\r\n    </Appearance>\r\n    ...\r\n</Shape>\r\n```\r\n\r\nThere, the Appearance node name \"_IDX_0\" conflicts with the Shape node name, which is forbidden.\r\n\r\nThe X3D exporter needs to use a different strategy to ensure uniqueness of node names. It should probably also be reviewed for other instances of this same issue.

Additionally, the \"importerIndex\" property shows the index of the X3D importer. I did not attempt to verify if any code in the X3D importer was actually being used.\r\n\r\nThe expected behavior is for ReadFile to return null, with GetErrorString returning an appropriate error message.\r\n\r\nThis appears to be a regression. In the 5.0.1 Bugfix release on the releases page, attempting to load unsupported file types indeed caused ReadFile to fail, leaving \"importerIndex\" unset and GetErrorString returning something like \"no importer found for file type\" (or something like that).\r\n\r\n[This test program](https://github.com/JC3/ModelSplit/tree/assimp-master-cd42b99/specific_tests/x3d_importer_fallback) (Qt not actually needed) demonstrates the issue. For each extension specified, it prints info about library support, and also creates a zero-length dummy file with that extension, attempts to import it, and prints info about the result. The output I'm seeing for extensions \"3ds\", \"assjson\" (which has an exporter but no importer), and \"qwerty\", is:\r\n\r\n```\r\nassimp 5.0.1 (master @ cd42b995)\r\n\r\nExtension: \"3ds\"\r\n  IsExtensionSupported:       true\r\n  GetImporterIndex:           3\r\n  GetImporter:                plugin=0x0000012F5897DDC0\r\n  ->GetExtensionList:         3ds prj\r\n  ->GetInfo->mName:           Discreet 3DS Importer\r\n  ->GetInfo->mFileExtensions: 3ds prj\r\n[created zero-length dummy file: dummy.3ds]\r\n  ReadFile (pFlags=0):\r\n    ReadFile:                 error: StreamReader: File is empty or EOF is already reached\r\n    importerIndex:            3\r\n    mName:                    Discreet 3DS Importer\r\n[deleting dummy file]\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------\r\nExtension: \"assjson\"\r\n  IsExtensionSupported:       false\r\n  GetImporterIndex:           -1\r\n  GetImporter:                plugin=0x0000000000000000\r\n[created zero-length dummy file: dummy.assjson]\r\n  ReadFile (pFlags=0):\r\n    ReadFile:                 success\r\n    importerIndex:            46\r\n    mName:                    Extensible 3D(X3D) Importer\r\n    scene->mFlags:            0x00000000\r\n[deleting dummy file]\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------\r\nExtension: \"qwerty\"\r\n  IsExtensionSupported:       false\r\n  GetImporterIndex:           -1\r\n  GetImporter:                plugin=0x0000000000000000\r\n[created zero-length dummy file: dummy.qwerty]\r\n  ReadFile (pFlags=0):\r\n    ReadFile:                 success\r\n    importerIndex:            46\r\n    mName:                    Extensible 3D(X3D) Importer\r\n    scene->mFlags:            0x00000000\r\n[deleting dummy file]\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn all cases, querying for extension support produced correct results, but ReadFile incorrectly succeeded on the unrecognized file types.\r\n\r\nNote also that no scene flags are set in the returned scenes.

It is meant to address #3647 (and, incidentally, #3786).\r\n\r\nThis allows developers to set the local ASSIMP_ENABLE_DEV_IMPORTERS environment variable to enable registration of importers that are otherwise unsuitable for release. Note that this is *not* intended to be used for importers that have bugs, etc., it's meant to be used for importers that are completely unavailable; e.g. the unimplemented X3D importer.\r\n\r\n- GetImporterInstanceList reads ASSIMP_ENABLE_DEV_IMPORTERS env var. Development importers are enabled if the env var is set and is not equal to the literal string \"0\".\r\n- X3D importer will not be registered unless ASSIMP_ENABLE_DEV_IMPORTERS is set.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n- If this change is incorporated, it should be documented.\r\n- Effective git branch structure is a *much* better solution. This is just a possible compromise that doesn't add a lot of work.\r\n- I think this is a hack.\r\n\r\nIt's OK to reject this PR, no feelings will be hurt. It's just another idea.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nQuick example; shows that X3D support is only enabled when env var is set:\r\n\r\n```\r\nc:\\Users\\jason\\Packages\\assimp-git\\BINARIES\\x64\\bin\\Release>assimp
