The ctor takes in refs but not const refs. My code paths failed as I was passing pos, rot and scale from const ref to a internal struct/class I had. This looked very odd to me. I looked at the code and it has nothing that would modify the passed in values. I even changed it and the build was fine after it. I reverted it before committing as I didn't want to touch anything but Ogre stuff in my pull request and thought you guys should have the final say.\n\nThe thing in question  https://github.com/assimp/assimp/blob/master/include/assimp/matrix4x4.h#L82-88\n\n**TL;DR** These should be const :)\n","closed_by":{"login":"acgessler","id":908209,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkwODIwOQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/908209?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/acgessler","html_url":"https://github.com/acgessler","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/acgessler/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/acgessler/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/acgessler/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/acgessler/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/acgessler/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/acgessler/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/acgessler/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/acgessler/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/acgessler/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assimp/assimp/issues/284/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assimp/assimp/issues/284/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
