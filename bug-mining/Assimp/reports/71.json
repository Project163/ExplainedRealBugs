This seems to be due to the lack of implementation bracket list initialises since Visual Studio 2013 Update 3 (Update 4 is current). Here is an example of the errors emitted (there are 114 of them, all similar):\r\n\r\n```\r\nError   1   error C2797: 'Assimp::BaseImporter::importerUnits': list initialization inside member initializer list or non-static data member initializer is not implemented (C:\\Temp\\assimp-5.0.0\\code\\Common\\ImporterRegistry.cpp) C:\\Temp\\assimp-5.0.0\\include\\assimp\\BaseImporter.h  203\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is the problematic part of the file.\r\n\r\n```\r\n    std::map<ImporterUnits, double> importerUnits = {\r\n        {ImporterUnits::M, 1},\r\n        {ImporterUnits::CM, 0.01},\r\n        {ImporterUnits::MM, 0.001},\r\n        {ImporterUnits::INCHES, 0.0254},\r\n        {ImporterUnits::FEET, 0.3048}\r\n    };\r\n```\r\n\r\nI've attempted using `std::make_pair` on the inner list instead but that doesn't help. I'm sure someone else already knows the proper fix.\r\n\r\n[Here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/error-messages/compiler-errors-2/compiler-error-c2797?view=vs-2019) Microsoft describe what the issue is.","closed_by":{"login":"kimkulling","id":2323156,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMjMxNTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2323156?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimkulling","html_url":"https://github.com/kimkulling","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimkulling/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimkulling/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimkulling/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimkulling/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimkulling/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimkulling/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimkulling/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimkulling/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimkulling/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assimp/assimp/issues/2678/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assimp/assimp/issues/2678/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
