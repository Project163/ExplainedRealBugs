Sadly my overloads are never called.\r\n\r\nThe problem seems to be, that the [`BaseImporter::ReadFile`](https://github.com/assimp/assimp/blob/v4.1.0/code/BaseImporter.cpp#L80) function [wraps](https://github.com/assimp/assimp/blob/v4.1.0/code/BaseImporter.cpp#L89) my `IOSystem` instance inside a `FileSystemFilter` and the `FileSystemFilter` doesn't forward the above mentioned functions to my `IOSystem` instance. Therefore just the default implementations will be called.\r\n\r\nOther virtual `IOSystem` functions ([`IOSystem::CreateDirectory`](https://github.com/assimp/assimp/blob/v4.1.0/include/assimp/IOSystem.hpp#L218), [`IOSystem::ChangeDirectory`](https://github.com/assimp/assimp/blob/v4.1.0/include/assimp/IOSystem.hpp#L225) and [`IOSystem::DeleteFile`](https://github.com/assimp/assimp/blob/v4.1.0/include/assimp/IOSystem.hpp#L227)) probably also can't be overridden.","closed_by":{"login":"kimkulling","id":2323156,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMjMxNTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2323156?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimkulling","html_url":"https://github.com/kimkulling","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimkulling/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimkulling/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimkulling/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimkulling/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimkulling/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimkulling/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimkulling/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimkulling/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimkulling/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assimp/assimp/issues/1773/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assimp/assimp/issues/1773/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
