While Draco is not supported (hopefully at some point we'll have that see #2195), in the meantime Assimp should likely check if `KHR_draco_mesh_compression` is present in the `extensionsRequired` array.\r\n\r\nThe specification states that if only Draco data is provided (it is possible to have a file with both compressed and uncompressed data) then the extension must be listed in `extensionsRequired`. So looks like it would make sense to explicitly check for this and throw and error if encountered for now to avoid crashes.\r\n\r\nIt may be worth exposing the `extensionsRequired` array in some fashion so callers can determine for themselves for other extensiosn whether they are able to support them, since it may depend on the engine it is coming into.","closed_by":{"login":"kimkulling","id":2323156,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMjMxNTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2323156?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimkulling","html_url":"https://github.com/kimkulling","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimkulling/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimkulling/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimkulling/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimkulling/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimkulling/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimkulling/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimkulling/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimkulling/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimkulling/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assimp/assimp/issues/2791/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assimp/assimp/issues/2791/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
