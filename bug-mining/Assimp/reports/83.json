Some importers (e.g., glTF, not sure about others) seem to try and set `mHorizontalFOV` to zero in an effort to flag the camera as orthographic, however then only the `mAspect` value is given preventing the full specification of a camera (width or height are needed at least in addition to aspect).\r\n\r\nI would propose adding an `mOrthographicWidth` property to the `aiCamera` structure which specifies the half horizontal width (using half width since Assimp went with the half FOV convention). If `0.0` this would mean the camera is not orthographic, otherwise the value specifies the half width of the orthographic viewbox in scene units. The height if required can be then derived from the aspect.\r\n\r\nThis should not break exiting importers/exporters since the default would be `0.0` and only those imports/exporters that inspect/set the value would do anything with it. I'll create a pull request with this implemented and with the glTF2 importer updated to use it, if other formats support orthographic cameras they could be added as well later on.\r\n\r\nOpen to other suggestions but since I had to make a change to one of the core structures (`aiCamera`) I wanted to try and make the change as small as possible.","closed_by":{"login":"kimkulling","id":2323156,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMjMxNTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2323156?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimkulling","html_url":"https://github.com/kimkulling","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimkulling/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimkulling/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimkulling/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimkulling/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimkulling/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimkulling/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimkulling/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimkulling/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimkulling/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assimp/assimp/issues/3030/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assimp/assimp/issues/3030/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
