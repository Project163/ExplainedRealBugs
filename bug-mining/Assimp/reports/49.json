Most of our test data is loading fine with Assimp 3.3.1, I only have a problem with one FBX file, where the translation of some child meshes is shiftet.\r\nThe same model in Collada format loads correctly. I've attached both models in the zip file below.\r\n\r\n[crankshaft.zip](https://github.com/assimp/assimp/files/654032/crankshaft.zip)\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"kimkulling","id":2323156,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMjMxNTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2323156?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimkulling","html_url":"https://github.com/kimkulling","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimkulling/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimkulling/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimkulling/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimkulling/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimkulling/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimkulling/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimkulling/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimkulling/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimkulling/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assimp/assimp/issues/1112/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assimp/assimp/issues/1112/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
