However, that version does not export gltf2 (there are some related discussions here about -fgltf2 not working). So I downloaded the source and compiled using VS 2019. I followed the instructions on the ReadMe.md page:\r\n\r\n    Open a command prompt\r\n    mkdir build\r\n    cd build\r\n    cmake ..\r\n    cmake --build .\r\n\r\nHowever, the compiled V 5.0.1 reports many errors that the older version does not.
