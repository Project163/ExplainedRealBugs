This is happening because the multiplication order is not to spec, from the glTF 2.0 spec (https://github.com/KhronosGroup/glTF/tree/master/specification/2.0):\r\n\r\n\"TRS properties are converted to matrices and postmultiplied in the T * R * S order to compose the transformation matrix; first the scale is applied to the vertices, then the rotation, and then the translation.\"\r\n\r\nYou can observe the issue when trying to import \"Project Polly\" from \"https://github.com/KhronosGroup/glTF-Blender-Exporter/tree/master/polly\".
