Build is fine but when I use Assimp from my code with only the include path and libs, build fails to find `pstdint.h`.\n\nThis was a recent bug fix for Visual Studio 9 2008 as it does not have `stdint.h`.\n\nI suggest `code/pstdint.h` should be moved to `include/assimp/Compiler/stdint.h`\n\nand this https://github.com/assimp/assimp/blob/master/include/assimp/metadata.h#L51 should be changed to `#include \"Compiler/pstdint.h\"`.\n\nWith the current setup people need to realize this by them selves and move the file manually to `/include/assimp` for the relative include path to work (if they dont happen to have this header somewhere in the projects include dirs).\n\nThis bug only impacts <= VS 2008.\n\n**P.S.** I can also do this but I don't know when I can get to it and if you might do the release before that. I think this should be fixed before the release.\n","closed_by":{"login":"acgessler","id":908209,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkwODIwOQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/908209?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/acgessler","html_url":"https://github.com/acgessler","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/acgessler/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/acgessler/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/acgessler/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/acgessler/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/acgessler/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/acgessler/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/acgessler/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/acgessler/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/acgessler/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assimp/assimp/issues/290/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assimp/assimp/issues/290/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
