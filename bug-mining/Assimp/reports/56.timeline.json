When they were not specified the importer simply did not create any triangles or other primitives in meshes even though the needed data was copied.\r\n\r\nThis patch adds support for the non-indexed versions of meshes by simply using the vertex counts provided to generate the indices within the mesh rather than using the accessors. This has been tested with both indexed and non-indexed meshes (as well as both in the same model) and it appears to work well.\r\n\r\nFixes #2046","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assimp/assimp/issues/2049/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assimp/assimp/issues/2049/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":1733990414,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MTczMzk5MDQxNA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assimp/assimp/issues/events/1733990414","actor":{"login":"kimkulling","id":2323156,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMjMxNTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2323156?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimkulling","html_url":"https://github.com/kimkulling","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimkulling/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimkulling/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimkulling/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimkulling/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimkulling/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimkulling/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimkulling/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimkulling/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimkulling/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-07-14T20:29:53Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":17296595456,"node_id":"LE_lADOAAnkjM4UKDUxzwAAAAQG9RoA","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assimp/assimp/issues/events/17296595456","actor":{"login":"tellypresence","id":26958898,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2OTU4ODk4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26958898?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tellypresence","html_url":"https://github.com/tellypresence","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tellypresence/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tellypresence/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tellypresence/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tellypresence/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tellypresence/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tellypresence/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tellypresence/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tellypresence/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tellypresence/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2025-04-16T22:04:31Z","label":{"name":"glTF2.0","color":"1d76db"},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
