Here is the relevant part:\r\n\r\n```cpp\r\nvoid ColladaParser::ReadAnimation(XmlNode &node, Collada::Animation *pParent) {\r\n...\r\n    for (XmlNode &currentNode : node.children()) {\r\n        if (currentName == \"animation\") {\r\n            ...\r\n        } else if (currentName == \"source\") {\r\n            ....\r\n        } else if (currentName == \"sampler\") {\r\n            if (XmlParser::getStdStrAttribute(currentNode, \"id\", id)) {\r\n                ...\r\n            } else if (currentName == \"channel\") {  // <-- this is wrong, this else-if belongs one level up\r\n               ...\r\n            }\r\n    }\r\n...\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is an example of a (stripped down) `<animation>` node:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<animation id=\"Cube_transform_\" name=\"Cube-Move\">\r\n      <source id=\"Cube_transform_-input\"></source>\r\n      <source id=\"Cube_transform_-output\"></source>\r\n      <source id=\"Cube_transform_-interpolation\"></source>\r\n      <sampler id=\"Cube_transform_-sampler\"></sampler>\r\n      <channel source=\"#Cube_transform_-sampler\" target=\"Cube/transform\"/>\r\n</animation>\r\n```\r\n\r\nA `channel` node is a direct child of `animation` but the current code cannot read it at all because of the wrongly placed `else-if`.\r\nThis looks like a merge error when the code was changed to use the new xml parser. The old code did it correctly.\r\nThe fix is to simply move the else-if with the `channel` one level up.","closed_by":{"login":"kimkulling","id":2323156,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMjMxNTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2323156?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimkulling","html_url":"https://github.com/kimkulling","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimkulling/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimkulling/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimkulling/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimkulling/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimkulling/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimkulling/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimkulling/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimkulling/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimkulling/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assimp/assimp/issues/3584/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assimp/assimp/issues/3584/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
