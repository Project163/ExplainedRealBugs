As it is mentioned in the comment there the source scene might have `src->mPrivate` equal to `NULL`. As a result you the program crashes at line 1024 when `src->mPrivate` is cast to `const ScenePrivateData*` and member `mPPStepsApplied` is set to 0.\n\nHere is a fix that worked for me:\n\n``` C++\n  if (ScenePriv(src))\n    ScenePriv(dest)->mPPStepsApplied = ScenePriv(src)->mPPStepsApplied;\n  else\n  {\n    dest->mPrivate = new Assimp::ScenePrivateData();\n    ScenePriv(dest)->mPPStepsApplied = 0;\n  }\n```\n","closed_by":{"login":"acgessler","id":908209,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkwODIwOQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/908209?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/acgessler","html_url":"https://github.com/acgessler","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/acgessler/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/acgessler/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/acgessler/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/acgessler/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/acgessler/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/acgessler/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/acgessler/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/acgessler/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/acgessler/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assimp/assimp/issues/401/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assimp/assimp/issues/401/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
