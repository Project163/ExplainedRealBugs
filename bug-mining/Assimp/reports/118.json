We properly find out that mesh contains data in channels a, b and c (example). But then d6aacefa1ef1219b85028b4038ef7e861c2e9462 changes a,b,c to 0,1,2 and we store data into wrong uv channels.\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\nSteps to reproduce the behavior:\r\n1. Import and render .dae with texture mapped mesh that uses uv channel 1.\r\n2. See that render is wrong, material wants data from channel 1 but data are stored in channel 0.\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nCollada files should be imported with original uv channel numbers in both meshes and materials.\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nI have problem locally fixed by reverting \"empty slots are not allowed\" paragraph of  d6aacefa1ef1219b85028b4038ef7e861c2e9462,\r\nI'll send patch.\r\nI'll also document that empty slots in mTextureCoords are ok... are they?\r\nAlso, I don't use GetNumUVChannels(), but I see it's implemented wrong. If we allow empty slots, it needs small fix.\r\nFinally, I'm concerned about .dae files that contain channel numbers higher than AI_MAX_NUMBER_OF_TEXTURECOORDS. Do they exist? Are they common? (My approach in LightsprintSDK was to make array of channels resizable, so I never had to figure out how large numbers exist in wild.)","closed_by":{"login":"kimkulling","id":2323156,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMjMxNTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2323156?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimkulling","html_url":"https://github.com/kimkulling","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimkulling/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimkulling/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimkulling/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimkulling/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimkulling/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimkulling/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimkulling/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimkulling/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimkulling/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assimp/assimp/issues/5632/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assimp/assimp/issues/5632/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
