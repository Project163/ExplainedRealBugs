expected the symbol name in libassimp.so to be \"aiGetImporterDesc\", but it is \"_Z17aiGetImporterDescPKc\".\r\nAll other symbol names are the same as their corresponding function names, this is the only exception.\r\nThis causes a symbol loading error.\r\n\r\nThis is the case in the current 5.0.1 Manjaro and ArchLinux packages.\r\n\r\nYou can see this from the output of the command\r\n\r\nnm -D /usr/lib/libassimp.so | grep aiGetImporterDesc\r\n\r\nPossible cause of the error:\r\nAll exported functions are declared with the ASSIMP_API prefix, and aiGetImporterDesc is the only function\r\nthat also uses the C_STRUCT macro on the return type, so I expect this macro to cause the error.\r\nSee code/Common/Assimp.cpp for this.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"kimkulling","id":2323156,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMjMxNTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2323156?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimkulling","html_url":"https://github.com/kimkulling","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimkulling/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimkulling/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimkulling/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimkulling/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimkulling/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimkulling/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimkulling/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimkulling/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kimkulling/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assimp/assimp/issues/3685/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assimp/assimp/issues/3685/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
