It worked nicely for first 2 formats (json, smile), and has been extended for couple more; but has been proven difficult to support for many other formats (due to arguably design flaws on many binary formats; lack of signature or magic cookie).\r\n\r\nAlthough incomplete support across all formats is not itself a fatal flaw (feature could be just used between formats where it is useful), there is non-trivial cost for maintaining support and implementations. But perhaps most importantly, it also imposes some complexity in the way ObjectMappers / ObjectReaders are used; and unless removed, prevents #1 (or requires significant new development to find a work-around).\r\n\r\nFor this reason, this feature will  be remove from Jackson 3.0.\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder","html_url":"https://github.com/cowtowncoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-core/issues/402/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-core/issues/402/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
