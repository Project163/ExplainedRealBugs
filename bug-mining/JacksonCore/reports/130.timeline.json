It's little bit different than that: if `e` notation is used, we will always get `JsonToken.VALUE_NUMBER_FLOAT`, not `VALUE_NUMBER_INT`. So we do not really (try to) parse `BigInteger` from E notation ever; it will go via `BigDecimal`. And I don't think we want to try to change this because it then gets into complications of variations (whether engineering value is integral or not).\r\n\r\nBut it seems to me that since the problem is conversion of `BigDecimal` into `BigInteger` we could impose limit on maximum `scale` -- from little I tried, it seemed that that's the key.\r\nWhether to make maximum scale magnitude (I am assuming both `20000000` and `-20000000` are problematic although haven't tested) configurable or just hard-coded is a question.\r\n\r\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-core/issues/comments/1496648960/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder","html_url":"https://github.com/cowtowncoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":8929140701,"node_id":"MEE_lADOAC5a085iYn4pzwAAAAIUN9_d","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-core/issues/events/8929140701","actor":{"login":"pjfanning","id":11783444,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNzgzNDQ0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11783444?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pjfanning","html_url":"https://github.com/pjfanning","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pjfanning/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pjfanning/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pjfanning/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pjfanning/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pjfanning/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pjfanning/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pjfanning/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pjfanning/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pjfanning/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2023-04-04T21:51:22Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":8929140711,"node_id":"SE_lADOAC5a085iYn4pzwAAAAIUN9_n","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-core/issues/events/8929140711","actor":{"login":"pjfanning","id":11783444,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNzgzNDQ0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11783444?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pjfanning","html_url":"https://github.com/pjfanning","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pjfanning/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pjfanning/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pjfanning/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pjfanning/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pjfanning/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pjfanning/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pjfanning/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pjfanning/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pjfanning/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2023-04-04T21:51:22Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-core/issues/comments/1496705203","html_url":"https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-core/issues/968#issuecomment-1496705203","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-core/issues/968","id":1496705203,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAC5a085ZNeiz","user":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder","html_url":"https://github.com/cowtowncoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","

It seems like it's not necessarily dangerous for general BigDecimal.\r\n\r\nAnd the other angle is that with scale of 1000 you get numeric string of ~1000 characters so in a way we could actually simply use existing value `maxNumberLength()` for conversion case: especially since we do not allow engineering notation for integer
