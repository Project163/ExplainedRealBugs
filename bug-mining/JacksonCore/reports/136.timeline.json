similar to #827 there should be some upper limit for length of `String` values. We can start with something rather long -- 5 megs -- since the handling of textual values is not nearly as sensitive to input length as that of numeric (in particular floating-point). And also because there are likely use cases that rely on ability to process sizable Strings (different from numbers once again).\n\nDifferent from number constraints we can and should apply limit during accumulation of textual value, into `TextBuffer` (either within it, or maybe more likely, when caller fetches new local `char[]` buffer). The idea being that we do want to avoid processing of the whole String before failing.\nThis would probably mean that the limit applies to `char` length after entity resolution. That should be fine too; the goal is not to impose byte-accurate limits but to prevent overloading.\n\nNote: this is also distinct from total document length limit that we likely want to impose too, eventually.\n\n**EDIT**: (21-Mar-2023) 2.15.0-rc1 had limit of 1M, rc2 planned to use 5M.

But string values are absolutely fundamental. If you have problems with \"random JSONs\" coming over your wires, I fail to see why it should be the (de)serialization library that hinders very long strings - this should be caught by some earlier mechanism where you control the size of the received payload.\r\n\r\nAgain, the other limits (e.g. excessive number of decimals, excessive nesting etc) makes more sense: These are arguably more subtle vectors for DoSing when using deserialization mechanisms, that are harder to envision and comprehend, compared to plain \"large payload size\". But even here the default limits should be very high, so that they never come in the way for something that _most probably_ are standard processing.\r\n\r\nIf you as a developer uncritically accept a payload of 10GB, then that is on you - I just fail to see why \"a random JSON deserialization library\" should have the _default_ obligation to protect you from this. It could be an optional feature, but why default?\r\n\r\nDo I make any sense here?\r\n\r\nEdit: Also, as probably mentioned earlier: The total document size (either just the consumed bytes - or the deserialized object tree or whatever) would be much saner to limit the size of - not any individual strings within such a document. I mean, as a DoS attack, I could now just hammer in 1M x 20M strings and rip your memory to pieces anyway.","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-core/issues/comments/1581446753/reactions","total_count":9,"+1":9,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"stolsvik","id":3123344,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxMjMzNDQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3123344?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/stolsvik","html_url":"https://github.com/stolsvik","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stolsvik/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stolsvik/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stolsvik/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stolsvik/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stolsvik/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stolsvik/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stolsvik/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stolsvik/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stolsvik/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-core/issues/comments/1581657373","html_url":"https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-core/issues/1014#issuecomment-1581657373","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-core/issues/1014","id":1581657373,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAC5a085eRi0d","user":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder","html_url":"https://github.com/cowtowncoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-06-07T23:39:14Z","updated_at":"2023-06-07T23:39:14Z","body":"I think it's safe to say that opinions on how much \"default protection\" should be provided vary A LOT. From \"why would you ever accept longer than 64k string unless someone enables it\" to \"just leave it at Integer.MAX_VALUE unless _I_ say otherwise\". There are valid points to all views and it really depends.\r\n\r\nIn hindsight this particular setting should probably have been left at relatively high value; but with versions being out there I don't think I'll be changing defaults for 2.15.x at least.\r\nFor 2.16 we can still consider changes; if so, please file a new issue.\r\n\r\nAnd yes, I agree wrt points on max doc size limit -- it was left out due to timing constraints.\r\nI do not necessarily agree that max doc size only matters (if we are talking about max input length), since there is streaming use case where input size may be sort of infinite, as it is never read fully in memory in its entirety: this is different from JSON Strings which are always read fully in memory (even if lazily).\r\n\r\nAnd conversely limiting String value length was inspired by number length limit; however, it's not a good analogy as the trade-offs are quite different.\r\n\r\nOne takeway for me, too, is that I should have heeded my own \"never add a feature just for sake of consistency; only implement things that have been specifically requested\".\r\nThat'd have worked well here, addressing just number length & nesting depth -- both of which have specific known threats.\r\n\r\nThank you everyone for your feedback

have to go back a bit here as to why I think the extension in Ebean makes sense.\r\n\r\n## Expected behavior\r\n- What ebean writes, it should also be able to read again\r\n\r\n## Actual behavior\r\n- With the update to Jackson 2.15.0 the following code fails:\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\n```java\r\n    String s = new String(new char[5_000_001]).replace('\\0', 'x');\r\n\r\n    EBasicJsonMap bean = new EBasicJsonMap();\r\n    bean.setName(\"b1\");\r\n    bean.setContent(Map.of(\"string\", s));\r\n    DB.save(bean); // Expected: Throw an error that data is too long here.\r\n\r\n    DB.find(EBasicJsonMap.class, bean.getId()); // Actual: throws LoadError, because String is too long\r\n```\r\nSee Discussion https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-core/issues/863 and https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-core/issues/1014\r\nLong story short: Jackson disallows the deserialization of strings > 5M (2.15.1 >20M)\r\n\r\nThe bug/change in jackson crashes our application\r\nAll in all, writing so long strings in JSON is\r\na) a bad idea\r\nb) was caused in our situation by a programming error, that has written too big JSON string.\r\n\r\nWe have used `@DbJson` for now without specifying a length attribute, which means, that this defaults effectively to 2G on most platforms - we've learned our lession, that this might bring us further trouble, if some code produces too big JSONs, so we tend to to specify JSON lengths to these properties.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, this causes further issues:\r\n- while `@DbJson(length = 5000)` works fine on H2, it fails on SqlServer when creating the column as `nvarchar(5000)` with `The size (5000) given to the parameter 'content' exceeds the maximum allowed (4000)`\r\n- Similar limits for other DBMS (MariaDB supports up to 64K bytes per row. Depending on the charset etc. this will eat up more bytes)\r\n- unfortunately, we often have very big limits (16K or even 1M for complex configuration documents), so varchar is not always the best option and we need to fall back to \"clob\"\r\n\r\nWhat I want to change now is mainly in this PR #3102, but I think I have to break up this in several things\r\n- When a certain length is exceeded (e.g. 8K) always use CLOB: https://github.com/ebean-orm/ebean/pull/3102/files#diff-a0869c5d693887c73e19540c58ffa503eb8fa6584bbad05c1ef0e9d5c363626cR163\r\n- Handle \"specials\" for SqlServer nvarchar (use 'max' if value > 4000)\r\n- Support an \"active\" length check by ebean, before data is written to the DB (to avoid to write too long strings to clob fileds)\r\n\r\n@rbygrave I know, the causing issue is mainly jackson related, but it shows up, that length checks for JSON is quite limited in ebean (at least if you have to deal with JSON lengths > 4000), so it would be great, if I get some feedback here.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ebean-orm/ebean/issues/3103/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ebean-orm/ebean/issues/3103/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"actor":{"login":"easayliu","id":54569917,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0NTY5OTE3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/54569917?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/easayliu","html_url":"https://github.com/easayliu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/easayliu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/easayliu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/easayliu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/easayliu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/easayliu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/easayliu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/easayliu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/easayliu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/easayliu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-06-26T01:55:49Z","updated_at":"2023-06-26T01:55:49Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/metersphere/metersphere/issues/25156","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/metersphere/metersphere","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/metersphere/metersphere/issues/25156/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/metersphere/metersphere/issues/25156/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/metersphere/metersphere/issues/25156/events","html_url":"https://github.com/metersphere/metersphere/issues/25156","id":1773658652,"node_id":"I_kwDODi2Ta85pt-Ic","number":25156,"title":"[BUG]

late in the game too, but I would like to thank you for correcting that \"bug\" with the 5'000'000 bytes size and increasing to 20'000'000 bytes. That solved our issue.\r\nThat said, since we are handling documents that can vary very much in size, even the 20'000'000 limit that you put, is already too small for us.\r\nWe installed the patch for our application yesterday with the version 2.15.2, and it solved all our problems, and today we receive a document which was bigger, and got the following error:\r\n\r\n Caused by: org.springframework.core.codec.DecodingException: JSON decoding error: String length (20054016) exceeds the maximum length (20000000)\r\n \r\n And for end of year, it will probably skyrocket to even higher numbers.\r\nSo for me, what would make more sense, is to have a generic solution, where the developer can decide what is the limit he wants.\r\nI will open a new issue ticket that in mind.\r\nFor the moment, we will try to have a custom version of this library and set the limit higher, so until an official solution is found, we can go back to the official one.\r\n\r\nPS: In our case, we are not subject to attacks, since our systems are not in internet, and the cycle of handling documents are well controlled from each step of the process. So we don't \"care\" if the limit was set to 10GB. Well we care about the memory used :-D of course!!! But these potential DOS-style attack in our really particular case is not a concern.\r\n\r\nPS2: Well I didn't open a new ticket since there are already tickets open for that and other aspects that are also important! So I won't pollute by opening a duplicate one! :-D","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-core/issues/comments/1623045770/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"ghost","id":10137,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMTM3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10137?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost","html_url":"https://github.com/ghost","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}}]
