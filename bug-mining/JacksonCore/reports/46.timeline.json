versions: 2.8.7/2.8.8/2.9.0.pr3\r\n\r\nI'm currently trying to enable a scheme like this, via YAML, for environment specific configuration:\r\n\r\n```\r\n_default_:\r\n  value1: \"dev_value\"\r\n\r\nproduction:\r\n  value1: \"prod_value\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nI'm trying to do this by creating an ObjectReader and using `ObjectReader.at(\"/_default_\")` or, more generally, `ObjectReader.at(\"/\" + ENV_NAME)` method calls.\r\n\r\nThis works great when combined with 'readerForUpdate' to create environment-specific overrides against specific configuration POJOs.  However, I've found that the following breaks:\r\n\r\n```\r\n_default_:\r\n  set1:\r\n    - one\r\n    - two\r\n  set2:\r\n    - three\r\n    - four\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn that case, calling `ObjectReader.at(\"/_default_\").readValue(yamlString)` returns an object that has a null value for 'set2'.  I initially thought this was an issue with the YAML parser itself, but found the same issue with the JSON parser.\r\n\r\nTest Case:\r\n\r\n```\r\npublic class JsonPointerTest {\r\n\r\n    @Test\r\n    public void testJsonPointer() throws Exception {\r\n        final String json = \"{\\n\\\"wrapper1\\\": {\\n\" +\r\n                \"  \\\"set1\\\": [\\\"one\\\", \\\"two\\\", \\\"three\\\"],\\n\" +\r\n                \"  \\\"set2\\\": [\\\"four\\\", \\\"five\\\", \\\"six\\\"]\\n\" +\r\n                \"},\\n\" +\r\n                \"\\\"wrapper2\\\": {\\n\" +\r\n                \"  \\\"set1\\\": [\\\"one\\\", \\\"two\\\", \\\"three\\\"],\\n\" +\r\n                \"  \\\"set2\\\": [\\\"four\\\", \\\"five\\\", \\\"six\\\"]\\n\" +\r\n                \"}\\n}\";\r\n\r\n        final TestObject testObject = new ObjectMapper().readerFor(TestObject.class).at(\"/wrapper1\").readValue(json);\r\n\r\n        Assert.assertNotNull(testObject);\r\n\r\n        Assert.assertNotNull(testObject.getSet1());\r\n        Assert.assertTrue(!testObject.getSet1().isEmpty());\r\n\r\n        Assert.assertNotNull(testObject.getSet2());\r\n        Assert.assertTrue(!testObject.getSet2().isEmpty());\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    public static class TestObject {\r\n        private Set<String> set1;\r\n        private Set<String> set2;\r\n\r\n        public Set<String> getSet1() {\r\n            return set1;\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        public void setSet1(Set<String> set1) {\r\n            this.set1 = set1;\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        public Set<String> getSet2() {\r\n            return set2;\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        public void setSet2(Set<String> set2) {\r\n            this.set2 = set2;\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\n```\r\nSeems like the parser is exiting early after the first array value?  I've tested this with 2.8.8 and 2.9.0.pr3 and both fail the test case.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/1637/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/1637/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":1105000041,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDExMDUwMDAwNDE=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-core/issues/events/1105000041","actor":{"login":"rfoltyns","id":13997200,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzOTk3MjAw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13997200?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rfoltyns","html_url":"https://github.com/rfoltyns","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rfoltyns/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rfoltyns/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rfoltyns/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rfoltyns/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rfoltyns/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rfoltyns/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rfoltyns/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rfoltyns/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rfoltyns/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"6f6bbb83aa4b1c7319c35500a25e38c3f163a997","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rfoltyns/jackson-core/commits/6f6bbb83aa4b1c7319c35500a25e38c3f163a997","created_at":"2017-05-31T21:30:49Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"actor":{"login":"rfoltyns","id":13997200,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzOTk3MjAw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13997200?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rfoltyns","html_url":"https://github.com/rfoltyns","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rfoltyns/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rfoltyns/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rfoltyns/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rfoltyns/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rfoltyns/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rfoltyns/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rfoltyns/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rfoltyns/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rfoltyns/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-05-31T21:34:38Z","updated_at":"2017-05-31T21:34:38Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-core/issues/381","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-core","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-core/issues/381/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-core/issues/381/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-core/issues/381/events","html_url":"https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-core/pull/381","id":232703281,"node_id":"MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0MTIzMzc0MTA5","number":381,"title":"#330
