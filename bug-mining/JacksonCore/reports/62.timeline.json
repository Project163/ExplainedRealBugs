version (BOM): `2.15.2`\r\n\r\nWhile experimenting with `JsonPointer` in Spring Framework, I tried to build up on the existing `FilteringParserDelegate` and associated `JsonPointerBasedTokenFilter`. Unfortunately, this doesn't seem to work with a non-blocking `JsonParser` delegate, for several reasons:\r\n - it doesn't delegate method `canParseAsync()` (ends up returning the default interface implem => `false`)\r\n - it doesn't delegate method `getNonBlockingInputFeeder()` (same as above => `null`)\r\n - it isn't aware of `JsonToken.NOT_AVAILABLE`\r\n\r\nWhile the first two are easily circumvented by extending `FilteringParserDelegate`, the last one is the truly problematic one. It results in going down the code path of a \"scalar value\", and will continuously call `delegate.nextToken()` which continues to result in `NOT_AVAILABLE`.\r\n\r\nThis leads to an infinite loop when attempting to filter based on a `JsonPointer` on top of a non-blocking parser.\r\n\r\nIs there anything fundamentally preventing `FilteringParserDelegate` from being compatible with non-blocking parsers that I might have overlooked? Otherwise I think it's pretty close, hopefully that can be fixed 😄 ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-core/issues/1144/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-core/issues/1144/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
