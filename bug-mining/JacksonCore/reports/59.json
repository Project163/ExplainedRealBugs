Databinding is not used (unless caller makes some use of identity comparisons)\r\n2. If number of symbols used is big (due to overhead by JVM for managing big number -- hundreds of thousands or millions -- of Strings off-heap)\r\n\r\nTo me it seems reasonable that for use case of `ObjectMapper` implicitly creating a `JsonFactory` (or similar factory for other formats) default should remain the same. But I have no objection to using different default to \"direct\" usage.\r\nThere are multiple ways to achieve this: one possibility would just be to make `ObjectMapper` explicitly set the default if it directly creates the factory; but not change setting if it is passed one.\r\nAnd then `JsonFactory` base class can just default to intern()ing being disabled by default.\r\n\r\nOther than this I am also open to possibility of changing defaults for databinding use case, if all major framework developers choose explicitly disabled settings as their baseline.\r\n(authors/contributors of major frameworks like Spring Boot, Dropwizard, Restlet etc etc please send your notes to mailing list, or directly to developers -- I am not looking forward to \"voting\" here; but I will add condensed notes here for any input we receive).\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder","html_url":"https://github.com/cowtowncoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-core/issues/378/reactions","total_count":6,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":6,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-core/issues/378/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
