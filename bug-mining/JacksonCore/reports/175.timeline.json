Search before asking\n\n- [X] I searched in the [issues](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues) and found nothing similar.\n\n### Describe the bug\n\nThis bug probably heavily relates to https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/4435 which was previously fixed using https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-core/pull/1241\r\n\r\nSince jackson 2.17 while deserializing BigDecimals (or integers) from JsonInput with a string value of the format \".f\" e.g. {\"value\":\"3.\"} we get an exception that looks like the following:\r\n\r\n```\r\ncom.fasterxml.jackson.databind.exc.InvalidFormatException: Cannot deserialize value of type `java.math.BigDecimal` from String \"5.\": not a valid representation\r\n at [Source: REDACTED (`StreamReadFeature.INCLUDE_SOURCE_IN_LOCATION` disabled); line: 1, column: 10] (through reference chain: TestDTO[\"value\"])\r\n\r\n\tat com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.exc.InvalidFormatException.from(InvalidFormatException.java:67)\r\n\tat com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.DeserializationContext.weirdStringException(DeserializationContext.java:1958)\r\n\tat com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.DeserializationContext.handleWeirdStringValue(DeserializationContext.java:1245)\r\n\tat com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.deser.std.NumberDeserializers$BigDecimalDeserializer.deserialize(NumberDeserializers.java:1058)\r\n\tat com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.deser.std.NumberDeserializers$BigDecimalDeserializer.deserialize(NumberDeserializers.java:990)\r\n\tat com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.deser.impl.MethodProperty.deserializeAndSet(MethodProperty.java:129)\r\n\tat com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.deser.BeanDeserializer.vanillaDeserialize(BeanDeserializer.java:310)\r\n\tat

com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.ObjectMapper.readValue(ObjectMapper.java:3816)\r\n\tat BigDecimalTest.shouldDeserializeBigDecimalFromJacksonDataBind(BigDecimalTest.java:26)\r\n\tat

java.base/java.util.ArrayList.forEach(ArrayList.java:1596)\r\n```\r\n\r\nI am not sure if this deserialization behavior change is intended or not. However, both Java and javascript appear to understand \"5.\" as a number.\r\n\n\n### Version Information\n\n2.17 and 2.17.1\n\n### Reproduction\n\nThe reproduction steps are equivalent to the steps described in https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/4435\r\n\r\ni.e., in https://github.com/EAlf91/jackson-issue simply switch the test case from \".05\" to \"5.\"\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nIf this change in behavior is not intended, I would expect jackson to parse \"3.\" as a decimal, (i.e., 3.0), or as an integer (i.e., 3)\r\n\n\n### Additional context\n\nSee the related issue https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/4435 that describes a similar bug that was previously fixed\r\n\r\nWithout knowing the jackson codebase, I would expect that the allowed pattern for https://github.com/pjfanning/jackson-core/blob/1c60872851893a8994bfa7131edcb13e2e67e4fe/src/main/java/com/fasterxml/jackson/core/io/NumberInput.java#L41 should be modified to also allow float number definitions which do not have numerals after the period.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/4577/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/4577/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":13153668937,"node_id":"REFE_lADOAC5a086MM6D3zwAAAAMQBQ9J","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-core/issues/events/13153668937","actor":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder","html_url":"https://github.com/cowtowncoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"40f8daeb78d453d3faf17443361accf640889d44","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-core/commits/40f8daeb78d453d3faf17443361accf640889d44","created_at":"2024-06-13T23:09:30Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":13153691062,"node_id":"REFE_lADOAC5a086MM6D3zwAAAAMQBWW2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-core/issues/events/13153691062","actor":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder","html_url":"https://github.com/cowtowncoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"55261befb15a3597ec627d56b1959aa9aa9ef77c","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-core/commits/55261befb15a3597ec627d56b1959aa9aa9ef77c","created_at":"2024-06-13T23:14:15Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":13153693597,"node_id":"CE_lADOAC5a086MM6D3zwAAAAMQBW-d","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-core/issues/events/13153693597","actor":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder","html_url":"https://github.com/cowtowncoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":"55261befb15a3597ec627d56b1959aa9aa9ef77c","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-core/commits/55261befb15a3597ec627d56b1959aa9aa9ef77c","created_at":"2024-06-13T23:14:52Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
