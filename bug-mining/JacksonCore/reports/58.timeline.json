That seems kind of .... wrong to me -- simply ignoring non-alphabet characters would be very likely to simply mask legitimate issues without helping inter-operability... I can understand whitespace being exception.\r\nBut at the same time following specifications is important.\r\nI'll have to think about this question; and in all likelihood change would need to be:\r\n\r\n1. Go in 3.0, not 2.9 as this is major behavioral difference\r\n2. Possibly have matching `JsonParser.Feature` to allow failure (but default to permissive, specification-defined approach)\r\n\r\nThe other question wrt YAML is something we could perhaps tackle more easily by allowing use of different default Base64 encoding.
