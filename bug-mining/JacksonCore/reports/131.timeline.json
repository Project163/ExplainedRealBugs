Feature Request\r\nI'd like a way to determine if `getNumberType()` is guaranteed to return an exact response or might lose precision if parsed to the corresponding native type.\r\n\r\n## Motivation\r\nThe JSON `JsonParser`s always return `NumberType.DOUBLE` -- never `FLOAT` or `BIGDECIMAL`. Consequently, I've been (incorrectly) parsing all JSON `JsonToken.VALUE_NUMBER_FLOAT` as doubles, losing precision for anything that doesn't fit. [These comments](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-core/blob/4465e7a383b4ca33f9a011e1444d67d7f58fca1c/src/main/java/com/fasterxml/jackson/core/base/ParserBase.java#L672-L677) suggest that the reason for always returning `DOUBLE` is that BigDecimal parsing is expensive, so it's up to the jackson-core consumer to ask for one if they want it.\r\n\r\nAs a user of the `JsonParser` I don't know if I want a `BigDecimal` at the point I interact with the `JsonParser`. I'm pushing the value downstream to be interpreted later. I'd like to get either a primitive `float`/`double` or else a `CharSequence`. This is the approach I'm taking in https://github.com/rallyhealth/weePickle/pull/102.\r\n\r\nHowever, converting all floats to strings is suboptimal when used with jackson-dataformats-binary. `SmileParser` knows that a double-tagged value (`0x29`) is 100% guaranteed to fit in a primitive double, but I have to convert it to a base10 string (and probably back to a base2 double later), since I can't trust `getNumberType`'s answer of `DOUBLE`.\r\n\r\nI've found https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-core/issues/631, but for JSON, it appears always to return `BigDecimal` even for values like `0.0` that would fit in a double. I've benched about a 50% throughput penalty for sending all floats through `BigDecimal`.\r\n\r\nAFAICT, it is not possible to determine whether or not to trust `getNumberType()` to avoid precision loss for any given `JsonParser` without hardcoding to its known behavior ahead of time (which may change in subsequent releases).\r\n\r\n## Proposal\r\nI don't see a way to update the JSON `JsonParser` to return exact `getNumberType()` values without increasing upfront parsing cost, but if I had a signal that `getNumberType()` is trustworthy for a Smile JsonParser, but not for a JSON JsonParser, I could work around it. I would be able to ask for Strings for _only_ non-exact values.\r\n\r\nI think some method like `boolean isNumberTypeGuaranteedExact()` would satisfy my needs. Being able to ask for each token seems ideal. For the JSON JsonParser, it might return `false` for all `JsonToken.VALUE_NUMBER_FLOAT`.\r\n\r\nWDYT? And especially, is there some other existing option that I've overlooked?\r\n\r\nThanks!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-core/issues/730/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-core/issues/730/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":8956912468,"node_id":"REFE_lADOAC5a085i5AbfzwAAAAIV36NU","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-core/issues/events/8956912468","actor":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder","html_url":"https://github.com/cowtowncoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"debf306bd664921301d9b00256151ebc85bca588","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-core/commits/debf306bd664921301d9b00256151ebc85bca588","created_at":"2023-04-08T03:00:49Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":8956912471,"node_id":"REFE_lADOAC5a085i5AbfzwAAAAIV36NX","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-core/issues/events/8956912471","actor":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder","html_url":"https://github.com/cowtowncoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"1b536a0c6eab3e6d3b644879af7cd37a0b8d1447","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-core/commits/1b536a0c6eab3e6d3b644879af7cd37a0b8d1447","created_at":"2023-04-08T03:00:49Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":8956915703,"node_id":"CE_lADOAC5a085i5AbfzwAAAAIV36_3","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-core/issues/events/8956915703","actor":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder","html_url":"https://github.com/cowtowncoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":"38852ba7565643284d0efc90517a27972bc88576","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-core/commits/38852ba7565643284d0efc90517a27972bc88576","created_at":"2023-04-08T03:03:32Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":8956920711,"node_id":"REFE_lADOAC5a085i5AbfzwAAAAIV38OH","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-core/issues/events/8956920711","actor":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder","html_url":"https://github.com/cowtowncoder","followers_url":"https://ap
