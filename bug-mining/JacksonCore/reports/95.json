Elsewhere in Jackson (f.ex in Tree Model) this difference is indicate properly.\r\n\r\nSo: let's add `writePOJO()` (and `writePOJOField()`) in 2.13 (and perhaps deprecate later in 2.14 or so): in 3.0 we can then remove old methods and only keep new ones.\r\n\r\nNOTE: `writeObjectFieldStart()`, `writeObjectId()` and `writeObjectRef()` should remain as-is since the naming is less confusing (first method actually refers to data-level Object Value; and for other 2 Id/Ref make it clear these must be for Object entities).\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder","html_url":"https://github.com/cowtowncoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-core/issues/673/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-core/issues/673/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
