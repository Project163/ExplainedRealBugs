@cowtowncoder, good to hear!\r\n\r\nHope you had a nice Thanksgiving and some time to recover!\r\n\r\nJava provenance is currently generated using the [SLSA generic generator](https://github.com/slsa-framework/slsa-github-generator/tree/main/internal/builders/generic). This involves adding two \"parts\" to the workflow: one step immediately after the deploy to calculate the hashes for the relevant jars, and a separate job (for security reasons) to generate the provenance.\r\n\r\nIf you'd be interested, I've actually already made the requisite changes in a fork, I'd be happy to submit a PR for you to take a look.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nOr, if you'd first like to take a look at how the workflow works, see a successful run [here](https://github.com/pnacht/jackson-core/actions/runs/3535811086). That run was on a slightly different version of the workflow than would be in the PR since my fork naturally can't deploy, so it instead uploads the jars as a workflow artifact.\r\n\r\nThe `.intoto.jsonl` file is the provenance. It's a JSON file, but the most important value (\"payload\") is a base64'd json blob. If you want to glance at it, I'd suggest using `jq`:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\njq -r '.payload | @base64d' jackson-core-2.14.0-SNAPSHOT.intoto.jsonl | jq\r\n```\r\n\r\nThere's a lot of information there, so if you want, I can write up a little summary of the most relevant bits.","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-core/issues/comments/1329798171/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"pnacht","id":15221358,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MjIxMzU4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15221358?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pnacht","html_url":"https://github.com/pnacht","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pnacht/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pnacht/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pnacht/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pnacht/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pnacht/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pnacht/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pnacht/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pnacht/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pnacht/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":7907090436,"node_id":"MEE_lADOAC5a085XK2HszwAAAAHXTKAE","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-core/issues/events/7907090436","actor":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder","html_url":"https://github.com/cowtowncoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-11-28T21:45:31Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":7907090439,"node_id":"SE_lADOAC5a085XK2HszwAAAAHXTKAH","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-core/issues/events/7907090439","actor":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder","html_url":"https://github.com/cowtowncoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-11-28T21:45:31Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-core/issues/comments/1330104265","html_url":"https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-core/issues/844#issuecomment-1330104265","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-core/issues/844","id":1330104265,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAC5a085PR8fJ","user":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder","html_url":"https://github.com/cowtowncoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false

However, I must admit my ignorance as to how precisely to do that via GitHub Actions.\r\n\r\nYou'll notice the provenance is created in a separate job from the rest of the workflow. This is for security purposes, to ensure the provenance generation is isolated and secure against external interference. If there's interest, I could submit another PR to split the build job into build, deploy, and codecov jobs. This would ensure that things such as credentials cannot leak to other steps (see [GitHub's docs on risks of compromised runners](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/security-hardening-for-github-actions#accessing-secrets)).","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-core/issues/847/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-core/issues/847/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-core/issues/comments/1331179591","html_url":"https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-core/issues/844#issuecomment-1331179591","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-core/issues/844","id":1331179591,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAC5a085PWDBH","user":{"login":"pnacht","id":15221358,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MjIxMzU4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15221358?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pnacht","html_url":"https://github.com/pnacht","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pnacht/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pnacht/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pnacht/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pnacht/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pnacht/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pnacht/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pnacht/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pnacht/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pnacht/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-11-29T19:21:20Z","updated_at":"2022-11-29T19:21:39Z","body":"@cowtowncoder I've submitted the PR!\r\n\r\nSo, using the .intoto.jsonl provenance file from the [run](https://github.com/pnacht/jackson-core/actions/runs/3535811086) I mentioned earlier, we can run the following command (or use the Rekor link mentioned at the very bottom):\r\n\r\n```bash\r\njq -r '.payload | @base64d' jackson-core-2.14.0-SNAPSHOT.intoto.jsonl | jq\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis outputs the entire provenance, the most relevant parts of which are:\r\n\r\n- \"subject\" identifies both jars (jackson...jar and jackson...-sources.jar), along with their SHAs\r\n- \"predicate\" shows a bunch of information regarding how the jars were built, most interestingly:\r\n  - \"builder\" shows the provenance was generated with the \"generic generator\" (used for languages without a SLSA builder)\r\n  - \"invocation\" shows the jars were created from my fork's 2.14 branch, at a specific commit, using the main.yml workflow\r\n- \"materials\" at the end also describes the \"subjects\", but by pointing at the \"ingredients\" used to generate them, not just their names.

#844.\r\n\r\nCI build with SLSA provenance\r\n-------------------------------\r\n\r\nAs discussed in https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-core/pull/847#discussion_r1045369427, this PR will allow jackson's maintainer to migrate from releasing on their local machine to a CI release, while keeping the `mvn release:prepare` workflow they're used to.\r\n\r\nThis is done via the new `release.sh` script, which:\r\n- runs `mvn release:clean release:prepare` (without pushing to GitHub)\r\n- makes a few changes to the output (described below)\r\n- pushes the new commits and tag to GitHub\r\n\r\nWhen the new tag is pushed to GitHub, the new `release.yml` workflow kicks in and performs the final `mvn release:perform` step, as well as generating SLSA provenance.\r\n\r\nWork done by `release.sh`\r\n---------------------------\r\n\r\n`mvn release:prepare` effectively does three things:\r\n- it creates a new commit where all SNAPSHOT versions are replaced by non-SNAPSHOT versions\r\n- it creates a tag pointing to this commit\r\n- it creates a new commit back to SNAPSHOT versions (if the next version)\r\n\r\n`release.sh` has to rewrite the commits created by `mvn release:prepare`.\r\n\r\nThis is because `mvn release:perform` requires a `release.properties` file that is created by `release:prepare`,* but that isn't actually committed. Since `perform` will be run in the CI, we need `release.properties` to be committed as well.\r\n\r\nWe must therefore rewrite the commits so that `release.properties` is added to the first commit and then deleted in the second commit (so the final result is unchanged). In changing the commits, we also need to recreate the tag.\r\n\r\nWork done by `release.yml`\r\n----------------------------\r\n\r\nThe workflow itself is straightforward: it checks out the code (on the commit tied to the pushed tag) and then runs `mvn release:perform`.\r\n\r\nOnce the release is complete, it calculates the jar's hash and uses it to create a SLSA provenance attestation file, which is added as a workflow artifact.\r\n\r\nThe workflow only runs on \"pure\" tags without metadata; tags ending with `-rc`, `.pr` or `b` are ignored (those were the variants I found in the project's list of tags, let me know if there are others you'd like to omit).\r\n\r\nLikely incorrect value\r\n---------------------\r\n\r\nThe workflow copied the `actions/setup-java` arguments from `main.yml`, which likely isn't correct (especially the `server-id: sonatype-nexus-snapshots`. Unfortunately, after checking out the pom.xml, I couldn't figure out what the correct ID would be.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n\\* Technically, `release:perform` accepts command line arguments, but [it doesn't work with GitHub URLs](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/MRELEASE-839).
