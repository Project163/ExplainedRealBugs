pull request updates the Jackson dependencies from 2.5.3 to 2.6.2.\n\nChangelog:\n- https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson/wiki/Jackson-Release-2.6\n- https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson/wiki/Jackson-Release-2.6.1\n- https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson/wiki/Jackson-Release-2.6.2\n\nJackson 2.6 provides very interesting filtering feature that works with JSON streaming, both at parsing and generating times. Once we move to this version we should be able to reimplement our `filter_path` feature (introduced by #10980) to a more understandable and maintainable implementation.\n\nThe test `TestMergeMapperTests.testConcurrentMergeTest` failed with jackson 2.6.1 with an issue similar to FasterXML/jackson-core#207. After being able [to reproduce the issue in a test](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-core/issues/207#issuecomment-138854278) a fix has been merged in FasterXML/jackson-core#213 and solved the issue.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/13344/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/13344/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
