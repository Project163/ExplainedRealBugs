This should be prevented by, for example:\r\n\r\n1. Imposing maximum depth (1000?) and simply failing cleanly\r\n2. Rewriting method to use iterative+stack approach to increase limit to be relative to heap space size (million(s) of segments).\r\n\r\nNote: this does not appear like something straight-forward to use by malicious actors since `JsonPointer` instances are not typically read from untrusted contents.
