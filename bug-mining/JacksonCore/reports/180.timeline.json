My first though is that:\r\n\r\n1. I am not sure \"/nums~/0\" (or \"/nums~\") is valid JSON Pointer expression: intent by spec is for `~0` and `~1` be mean escaped `~` and `/` characters, respectively. Spec is unclear on this point tho\r\n2. Given that Jackson does not fail (thrown exception), it seems it should work as you except, and there is a problem to solve\r\n3. Without looking at code, I am guessing that `~/` combination is taken to mean roughly same as `~1`, that is, escaped `/` character -- so it'd look for key `\"nums/0\"` hence not matching array at `\"nums~`\r\n\r\nChanging behavior is slightly backwards incompatible so fix would need to go in

so, behavior for tilde NOT followed by either '0' or '1' is technically unspecified, as far as I understand. The current implementation basically considers tilde to be \"general escape\", so if any other character than '0' or '1' follows, that character is used as-is, and tilde is skipped/ignored.\r\nThat is why the case here fails: key to look for is `\"nums/0\"`.\r\n\r\nI think I will change the behavior to instead include \"lone\" tildes as regular characters, so test as given would pass.
