This is because this piece of code:\n\n``` java\nprivate final static int _parseInt(String str)\n    {\n        final int len = str.length();\n        if (len == 0) {\n            return -1;\n        }\n        for (int i = 0; i < len; ++i) {\n            char c = str.charAt(i++);\n            if (c > '9' || c < '0') {\n                return -1;\n            }\n        }\n        // for now, we'll assume 32-bit indexes are fine\n        return NumberInput.parseInt(str);\n    }\n```\n\nWhen they found a number it interprets the segment as integer but in reality it should be the whole expression. For this reason I think that the condition should be changed to the inverse condition  (if it doesn't found any char then it is a number.\n\nIf you want I can send you a PR as well.\n\nAlex.\n","closed_by":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder","html_url":"https://github.com/cowtowncoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-core/issues/173/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-core/issues/173/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
