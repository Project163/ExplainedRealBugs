Does write padding (with specific character) and\r\n2. Accepts specific padding but does not require it (i.e. ok to omit)\r\n\r\nIt seems best to add a \"mutant factory\" method in `Base64Variant` instance (something like `withLenientPadding(boolean)` maybe?). Whether additional entries should be added `Base64Variants` is an open question.\r\nWe'll have to figure out what to do wrt existing \"usePadding()\" compared to new option; API may be cumbersome if we have 2 booleans but just 3 legal combinations.\r\n\r\nNote that we may also change API for configuration for Jackson 3.x, later on.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder","html_url":"https://github.com/cowtowncoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-core/issues/500/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-core/issues/500/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
