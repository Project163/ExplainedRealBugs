I've noticed that, ` ObjectMapper#readValue(URL src, Class<T> valueType)`, for example, will not close the stream if reading from the URL causes, say, a `FileNotFoundException`. The exception is thrown in the [createParser](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind/blob/3bae019c8c91def310ed9679806217cff52e8c52/src/main/java/com/fasterxml/jackson/databind/ObjectMapper.java#L3583) invocation, and so it is not caught by the `_readMapAndClose` call. I'm able to verify this by creating many instances to a URL that returns a 200—in these cases, `netstat` shows only one connection to the server. In the case of a URL returning a 404, there are many requests sitting in `ESTABLISHED`, and then proceed to hang in `CLOSE_WAIT`.\r\n\r\n```\r\njava.io.FileNotFoundException:\r\n\tat
