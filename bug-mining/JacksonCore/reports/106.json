It doesn't override this method from `JsonGenerator` so it fallback to its implementation:\r\n```\r\npublic void writeStartObject(Object forValue, int size) throws IOException {\r\n  writeStartObject();\r\n  setCurrentValue(forValue);\r\n}\r\n```\r\nIt first calls `writeStartObject()` and only then sets the value. This leads to `gen.getCurrentValue()` to be null in `PrettyPrinter#writeStartObject`, custom implementation of which may rely on this information.\r\n\r\nI suggest to either `setCurrentValue(forValue)` before `writeStartObject()` or `WriterBasedJsonGenerator` to implement `#writeStartObject(Object, int)`.\r\n\r\nVersion used: 2.13.3","closed_by":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder","html_url":"https://github.com/cowtowncoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-core/issues/759/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-core/issues/759/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
