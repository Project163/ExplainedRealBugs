If the input contains PII data this can be a potential security vulnerability or violation of data handling standards for given services.\r\n\r\nThis issue/ticket is requesting that the flag be changed to default to false, and align with a \"Secure by default\" approach to the library. Given how widely this library is used it could provide a wide impacting improvement to the security of applications across the industry.\r\n\r\nI acknowledge that this comes at the cost of;\r\n - A breaking change for many users\r\n - Increased difficulty in debugging\r\n\r\nI believe this cost should be paid now in advance of some potential exploit in the future. While developers always have to option to set this flag to false themselves manually, grepping repositories and seeing how infrequently this flag is altered leads me to conclude that there is a lot of data out there inappropriately logged.","closed_by":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder","html_url":"https://github.com/cowtowncoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-core/issues/991/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-core/issues/991/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
