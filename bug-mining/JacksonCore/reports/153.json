Exact type if known (binary formats) OR\r\n2. Well-known type -- `Double` OR `BigDecimal`, based on configuration\r\n3. In some edge cases (not-a-number aka `NaN`), `Double` as that can represent such values.\r\n\r\n(further complicating things, we also have secondary means of producing `NaN` values: value overflow for `double` (and theoretically, but not practically, `float`) which can produce `+INFINITY`)\r\n\r\nGiven all above confusion, I think we need a new method like `getNumberTypeFP()` -- with matching `enum NumberTypeFP` (to be able to express value `UNKNOWN`, no need for integer types).\r\nThat will allow deserializers to know if \"true number type\", and base logic on that, specifically avoiding conversions in case of Binary formats and allowing their use for Textual formats (or in general formats without explicit type information for FP numbers).\r\n\r\n**EDIT**: originally thought we'd need `getNumberTypeExplicit()`, but since the need is specifically for floating-point numbers, let's call it `getNumberTypeFP()` instead; no need for non-FP types. And can indicate semantics are for strict/explicit type.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder","html_url":"https://github.com/cowtowncoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-core/issues/1149/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-core/issues/1149/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
