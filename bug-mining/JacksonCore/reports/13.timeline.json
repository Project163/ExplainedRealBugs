Logically property name (`FIELD_NAME`) is different from `VALUE_STRING`, even if they are expressed with the same physical token in JSON. The intent was never to allow these interchangeably, and bug fixes to observed behavior are not included in \"no change to behavior\" limitation. One could argue that the original model could have considered both as strings, in \"String is a String\" way; but to me separation is useful to avoid other problem cases, such as trying to write a non-String as property name/key, something JSON does not allow. Checks can also catch invalid usage, where output sequences either happen to work correctly accidentally; or, worse, report no error but produce invalid JSON output.\nIt is unfortunate that the check did not exist earlier, as that would have prevented regression problems like the one you have.\n\nAs to the underlying problem here... it is bit difficult to say, without seeing code. Possibilities include not calling `START_OBJECT` before trying to write a field name (although that would likely have produced invalid JSON anyway); writing two field names in a row (which also would seem problematic).\nBut it does seem odd; more commonly I see reverse cases where field name was expected, string value written.\n\nActually, come to think of that: I assume there has to be one of:\n1. Use of custom serializer somewhere, before code gets back default POJO handler\n2. Use of non-JSON data format, in which case there may be some translation (specifically, XML backend has some nasty work-arounds for massaging event sequences)\n\nsince it should not be possible to get such an error only using standard serializers.\nOf course if it is possible, I would really like a repeatable test case to fix it.\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-core/issues/comments/166379923/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder","html_url":"https://github.com/cowtowncoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":497702131,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50NDk3NzAyMTMx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-core/issues/events/497702131","actor":{"login":"knightweb","id":16388403,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2Mzg4NDAz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16388403?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/knightweb","html_url":"https://github.com/knightweb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/knightweb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/knightweb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/knightweb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/knightweb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/knightweb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/knightweb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/knightweb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/knightweb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/knightweb/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2015-12-21T18:15:09Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":497702132,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDQ5NzcwMjEzMg==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-core/issues/events/497702132","actor":{"login":"knightweb","id":16388403,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2Mzg4NDAz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16388403?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/knightweb","html_url":"https://github.com/knightweb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/knightweb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/knightweb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/knightweb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/knightweb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/knightweb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/knightweb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/knightweb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/knightweb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/knightweb/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2015-12-21T18:15:09Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-core/issues/comments/166382138","html_url":"https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-core/issues/177#issuecomment-166382138","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-core/issues/177","id":166382138,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE2NjM4MjEzOA==","user":{"login":"knightweb","id":16388403,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2Mzg4NDAz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16388403?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/knightweb","html_url":"https://github.com/knightweb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/knightweb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/knightweb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/knightweb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/knightweb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/knightweb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/knightweb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/knightweb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/knightweb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/knightweb/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":fals

At point where call is made, a write call of a valid value token (or, structure, array/object) must be made.\nThis because exclusion is handled at parent level, due to historical reasons (bit more on this below)\n\nNow, exclusion of value may work in ARRAY and ROOT contexts; but in OBJECT context the issue is that the property name has already been written, and value is expected. There is no way to \"undo\" property name write. I would guess that the non-exception-throwing behavior did not necessarily produce output one would expect; it just did not throw an exception.\n\nIf I was rewriting generator API from scratch, I might choose logic where the property name was always buffered, only written if a value was to be written. This would allow for simpler exclusion/filtering by serializer. But at this point the behavior is what it is and unfortunately can not be changed.\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-core/issues/comments/166383734/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder","html_url":"https://github.com/cowtowncoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-core/issues/comments/166386352","html_url":"https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-core/issues/177#issuecomment-166386352","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-core/issues/177","id":166386352,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE2NjM4NjM1Mg==","user":{"login":"knightweb","id":16388403,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2Mzg4NDAz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16388403?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/knightweb","html_url":"https://github.com/knightweb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/knightweb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/knightweb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/knightweb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/knightweb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/knightweb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/knightweb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/knightweb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/knightweb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/knightweb/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-12-21T18:42:13Z","updated_at":"2015-12-21T18:42:13Z","body":"Thanks for the pointer.

thanks for the suggestion.  Writing an empty list solves the serialization problem I had with 2.6.  I'd agree it was a bug with my companies code, which previous versions allowed us to get away with.  \nI've done some comparing of the outputs produced by applying that fix and unfortunately they are not equal between version 2.5.4 and 2.6.  It would appear that version 2.6 no longer supports \"NON_EMPTY\" for properties with custom serialisers.  Although this is not a major issue it is a blocker to upgrading, as it would increase our payload size and also serve to clutter the json output.\n\nIs this something that could be consider for a 2.6 patch?
