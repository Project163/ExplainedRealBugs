Unfortunately those methods did have unnecessary complexity and ended up being removed from 2.10.\r\nThe issue is that while these were intended for internal-only use, they were `public`, and some libraries/frameworks ended up using them.\r\n\r\nSince it is easy enough to add them back in 2.12 patch (for 2.12.5), let's do that: mark methods as `@Deprecated`, remove from 3.0 -- the way it should have been done to begin with, wrt 2.10.\r\nI will merge change itself in 2.10 branch, just in case we might end up with a patch, but the important version is 2.12.5 as that will definitely be released.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder","html_url":"https://github.com/cowtowncoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-core/issues/713/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-core/issues/713/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
