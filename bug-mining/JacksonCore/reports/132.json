Given the significant [increase in supply-chain attacks][sonatype], the OpenSSF is focused on improving the security of the open-source ecosystem as a whole. For example, #792 was based on feedback from Scorecards, an OpenSSF tool.\r\n\r\nThe OpenSSF has also developed the [SLSA][slsa] specification for projects to attest to a published artifact's provenance, allowing its consumers to ensure that the artifact comes from a trusted source. There are also GitHub workflows to securely generate this provenance and CLI tools to verify an artifact's authenticity.\r\n\r\nGiven how Jackson is almost synonymous with JSON in the Java ecosystem, the OpenSSF has placed Jackson on its list of the 100 most important open-source projects. I'd therefore like to offer to help jackson-core incorporate SLSA into its deploy workflow.\r\n\r\nWould you be interested in a PR to adopt SLSA?\r\n\r\n[ossf]: https://openssf.org/\r\n[slsa]: https://slsa.dev/\r\n[sonatype]: https://www.sonatype.com/state-of-the-software-supply-chain/introduction","closed_by":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder","html_url":"https://github.com/cowtowncoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-core/issues/844/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-core/issues/844/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"reopened"}
