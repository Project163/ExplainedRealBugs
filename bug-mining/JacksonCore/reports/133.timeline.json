I also could have thought of this effect when we first encountered problems in combining the `maven-shade-plugin` and the `gradle-module-metadata-maven-plugin`.\r\n\r\nI think I would have to find a solution in the plugin. To somehow react to the _shade_ plugin and take it's configuration into account.\r\n\r\nJust as reminder, this is why we publish the metadata - version alignment through the BOM:\r\nhttps://blog.gradle.org/alignment-with-gradle-module-metadata\r\n\r\nThis is something you can not express in POM. Otherwise, I agree that there would be no point in adding the Gradle Metadata on top. I know at least one other library (JUnit5) that also has this feature (but the build with Gradle). The difference here is that we do this although the build is Maven. It was a bit of an experiment to do this back in the day, but it seemed to have worked flawlessly for the first 2 years or so. The issue now is that the _shade_ plugin came into play and combining plugins in Maven is tricky, as there is no clear concept in Maven how plugins can/should interact.\r\n\r\nBut anyway, if you feel it's not worth the trouble anymore, you could also remove the Gradle Metadata publishing again. Just let me know, as Jackson is the main reason right now for me to further extend that Maven plugin.\r\n\r\nWhat I would do (if I hopefully find the time this weekend):\r\n1) Extend the Gradle integration test we already have to catch such issues\r\n2) Investigate how I can improve the plugin to interact with the _shade_ plugin. And ideally find a satisfying solution and publish a new version.","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-core/issues/comments/1526070722/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"jjohannes","id":1963746,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NjM3NDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1963746?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jjohannes","html_url":"https://github.com/jjohannes","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jjohannes/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jjohannes/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jjohannes/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jjohannes/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jjohannes/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jjohannes/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jjohannes/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jjohannes/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jjohannes/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-core/issues/comments/1526091929","html_url":"https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-core/issues/999#issuecomment-1526091929","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-core/issues/999","id":1526091929,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAC5a085a9lCZ","user":{"login":"pjfanning","id":11783444,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNzgzNDQ0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11783444?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pjfanning","html_url":"https://github.com/pjfanning","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pjfanning/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pjfanning/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pjfanning/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pjfanning/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pjfanning/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pjfanning/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pjfanning/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pjfanning/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pjfanning/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-04-27T17:46:17Z","updated_at":"2023-04-27T17:46:17Z","body":"A
