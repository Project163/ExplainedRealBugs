that it's not sane to enable \"missing values\" and \"allow trailing comma\" at the same time.  Given that, if one is to allow trailing commas, one may as well allow any number of extra commas.\n\nI guess it depends on the context.  For something like Solr filter lists, position does not matter, only values.  If one is dealing with parallel arrays (two different arrays where the values line up), then one would want to retain the \"missing\" values to maintain the relative positions.
