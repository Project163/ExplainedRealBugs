objects is 60% of it, that's 300M) \r\n2. then i checked some char[] objects , they're json datas i put on zookeeper which is parsed by Jackson .  and those objects are refferenced by ThreadLocal , and the content inside is the same . my server had 500 threads ,so the total char[] is quite a big usage . \r\n    \r\n IMHO , those json file are read only in my server, so singleton instance of each is fit in my case .\r\nwould you give me some tips for how to dealing with this ? tks advance ! 😃 \r\n
