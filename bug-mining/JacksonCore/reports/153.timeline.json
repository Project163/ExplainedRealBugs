we get Double.class\r\n  Assertions.assertEquals(Double.class, x.get(\"double\").getClass());\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nwith 2.16.1 everything is ok, with 2.17-rc1 the Float.class assert fails with Double.class\r\n\r\nIn 2.16.1 UntypedObjectDeserializerNR calls JsonParser.getNumberType() and the Parser is able to return FLOAT\r\n```\r\nat

changes to the parser 2.17-rc1 goes directly to JsonParser.getDoubleValue(), the _deserializeFP() does not consider the NumberTypeFP.UNKNOWN case and fallsback to .getDoubleValue()\r\nhttps://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind/blob/2.17/src/main/java/com/fasterxml/jackson/databind/deser/std/UntypedObjectDeserializerNR.java#L358\r\n```\r\nat

with 2.17-rc1 every JsonParse must have to implement .getNumberTypeFP() to get the proper behaviour.\r\nbut I think that if we return .getNumberValue() when NumberTypeFP.UNKNOWN we get back to the behaviour we have in 2.16.\r\n```java\r\n// @since 2.17\r\nprotected Object _deserializeFP(JsonParser p, DeserializationContext ctxt) throws IOException\r\n{\r\n\tJsonParser.NumberTypeFP nt = p.getNumberTypeFP();\r\n\tif (nt == NumberTypeFP.UNKNOWN) {\r\n\t\treturn p.getNumberValue();\r\n\t}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhat do you think?
