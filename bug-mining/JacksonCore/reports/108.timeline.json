the bug**\r\nJackson will leak a file descriptor when using `writeValue(File resultFile, Object value)` in `ObjectMapper` and a failure occurs during closing the internal stream that's owned by Jackson (e.g. when flushing buffers). In this case, a file stream is created but the access to the file content is prohibited. This leads to the exceptional case that the stream is never closed and leaked. This bug may affect `jackson.core` but I think the core issues is located in databind's `_writeValueAndClose` due to poor resource handling.\r\n\r\nStack Trace:\r\n\r\n```\r\nwriteBytes:-1, FileOutputStream (java.io)\r\nwrite:354, FileOutputStream (java.io)\r\n_flushBuffer:2171, UTF8JsonGenerator (com.fasterxml.jackson.core.json)\r\nclose:1214, UTF8JsonGenerator (com.fasterxml.jackson.core.json)\r\n_writeValueAndClose:4573, ObjectMapper (com.fasterxml.jackson.databind)\r\nwriteValue:3763, ObjectMapper (com.fasterxml.jackson.databind)\r\nlambda$testJacksonBug2$1:54, MainTest\r\nexecute:-1, 1778629809 (MainTest$$Lambda$338)\r\nassertThrows:55, AssertThrows (org.junit.jupiter.api)\r\nassertThrows:37, AssertThrows (org.junit.jupiter.api)\r\nassertThrows:3082, Assertions (org.junit.jupiter.api)\r\ntestJacksonBug2:54, MainTest\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Version information**\r\nv2.13.3\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\nThis bug is a little bit tricky to reproduce but you can lock a file on Windows, where you can successfully create a file stream (with a valid file descriptor) but without access to any file content. On Unix, you need a lot of \"luck\" to get this case happening.\r\n\r\n1. Create a demo Java project with both jackson core and databind on Windows!\r\n2. Create a JUnit 5 test\r\n3. Copy example code\r\n\r\n```java\r\nclass MainTest {\r\n    @TempDir\r\n    File tempDir;\r\n\r\n    @Test\r\n    void testJacksonBug2() throws IOException {\r\n        Path filePath = Paths.get(tempDir.getAbsolutePath(), \"example.json\");\r\n        try (FileOutputStream outputStream = new FileOutputStream(filePath.toString());\r\n             FileChannel channel = outputStream.getChannel();\r\n             FileLock lock = channel.lock()) {\r\n            assertThrows(IOException.class, () -> new ObjectMapper().writeValue(filePath.toFile(), new JsonEntry()));\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        assertTrue(filePath.toFile().delete());\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    private static class JsonEntry {\r\n        public int value = 1;\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou'll notice that the the deletion of the example file (last line) will fail but also that JUnit is unable to clearup the temporary directory because a file descriptor is still open. Everything is fine if you comment out the \"writeValue\"-line or write through the locked channel.\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nThe file stream should be correctly closed, regardless of whether an exception is thrown or not. \r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nThis issue is related to #3455 but during `close` of `UTF8JsonGenerator`.\r\n\r\nWorkaround: use an owned stream with try-with-resources and passing the stream into Jackson.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/3508/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/3508/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":13218972358,"node_id":"REFE_lADOAC5a085LlpwxzwAAAAMT6YLG","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-core/issues/events/13218972358","actor":{"login":"sffej","id":534105,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNDEwNQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/534105?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sffej","html_url":"https://github.com/sffej","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sffej/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sffej/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sffej/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sffej/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sffej/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sffej/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sffej/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sffej/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sffej/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"96657ef4d016ff6bbef4e2732ad9f90388a54f9b","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sffej/jackson-core/commits/96657ef4d016ff6bbef4e2732ad9f90388a54f9b","created_at":"2024-06-19T16:46:21Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
