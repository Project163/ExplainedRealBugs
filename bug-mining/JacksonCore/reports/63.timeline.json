follow-up to #476)\r\n\r\n`ThreadLocal` based buffer recycling worked well for traditional blocking i/o where usage of a given parser or generator is usually (although not always!) limited to just a single blocking thread.\r\nAnd although in theory it would be possible to have systems that use sequence of threads for processing (for example first worked thread processing part of heard), we have observed no actual use cases.\r\nHowever, with async/non-blocking parsing, it is more likely that something similar occurs, in which -- for example -- one thread might process events for a single buffer-full of content.\r\n\r\nThis is problematic not because multiple threads try to access explicitly shared resource -- they won't -- but because ownership model gets twisted due to `ThreadLocal` access by parsers, generators, so that effectively `BufferRecycler` that should be \"owned\" by just one parser / generator at any given point in time may end up getting actually shared. And at this point lack of synchronization (which was assumed not needed due to `ThreadLocal` forcing access from just one thread -- not true if parser/generator accessed from multiple!) will allow sharing of actual underlying buffers.\r\n\r\nWe can solve this in multiple ways, but probably the first attempt should be changing array-access of `BufferRecycler` fields to use atomic accessors. This adds some overhead, which is likely negligible (only lock when obtain, release), although will probably reduce efficiency of actual recycling more. Still, it should be more efficient than no recycling, and actually safe, as opposed to corruption due to lack of sync.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-core/issues/479/reactions","total_count":5,"+1":5,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-core/issues/479/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":1851422051,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MTg1MTQyMjA1MQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-core/issues/events/1851422051","actor":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder","html_url":"https://github.com/cowtowncoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":"32dcb70d4363ea32f664dbfc528531bc70c18fa6","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-core/commits/32dcb70d4363ea32f664dbfc528531bc70c18fa6","created_at":"2018-09-18T05:35:53Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-core/issues/comments/423018171","html_url":"https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-core/issues/476#issuecomment-423018171","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-core/issues/476","id":423018171,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQyMzAxODE3MQ==","user":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder","html_url":"https://github.com/cowtowncoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-09-20T02:21:08Z","updated_at":"2018-09-20T02:21:08Z","body":"`2.9.7`

a webflux application, I experienced garbled requests under (moderately) heavy load: once in a while (i.e. 1 in 10 to 50.000 requests), the deserialization of the request body into the `@RequestBody` field yields wrong results.\n\nIn these bad results, field values are set to another field's value - but truncated to the lenght of the original field.\n\n \n\nExample:\n\nOriginal Request:\n\n```\n{\"subject\"`:\r\n\r\n{\"username\":\"USERNAME\"}\r\n\r\n,\"action\":\"HTTP:ACTION\",\"resource\":\"https://resource.url\"}\r\n \n```\n\nGarbeled Request (example):\n\n```\n{\"subject\":\r\n\r\n{\"username\":\"USERNAME\"}\r\n\r\n,\"action\":\"https://res\",\"resource\":\"https://resource.url\"}\r\n \n```\n\n \n\nThe error only appears with authentication (basic auth) enabled.\n\n \n\nI've created a test project to reproduce and better describe the error:\n\nhttps://github.com/mkutter/netty-webflux-load\n\n\n---\n\n**Affects:**
