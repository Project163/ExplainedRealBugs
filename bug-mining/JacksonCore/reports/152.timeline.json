Ok. So, turns out that about 2/3 are simple cases where last character just needs to be \"unread\" (offset adjusted) and things will work.\r\n\r\n3 cases are bit more involved since they read invalid token; and while in theory location could be constructed before the first character is read, that'd be wasteful for the common case of not needing location. So will preferably try to adjust location after the fact. This, however, may be challenging for case of buffer boundaries etc.\r\n\r\nBut one failing case cannot be solved per se but needs to be document (if not already done): one showing case of non-ASCII Unicode character, Column number for byte-based input.\r\nFor byte-based input, column offset is (and has to remain) byte-based offset and not character
