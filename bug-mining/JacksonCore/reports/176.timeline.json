got a high performance streaming use case where I'm handling some of the lower-level details. For example, translating a `VALUE_STRING` into a `double`. I'm relying on `NumberInput` with the appropriate `useFastParser` config, and would like to avoid extraneous `String` allocation when possible. The `BigDecimal` case is currently the most complete, as it works with `JsonParser#hasTextCharacters`:\r\n\r\n```java\r\nstatic BigDecimal parseStringAsBigDecimal(JsonParser parser) throws IOException {\r\n    final boolean useFastParser = parser.isEnabled(StreamReadFeature.USE_FAST_BIG_NUMBER_PARSER);\r\n    return parser.hasTextCharacters()\r\n            ? NumberInput.parseBigDecimal(parser.getTextCharacters(), parser.getTextOffset(), parser.getTextLength(), useFastParser)\r\n            : NumberInput.parseBigDecimal(parser.getText(), useFastParser);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe other similar cases aren't able to take advantage since the underlying `char[]` parsing methods aren't exposed:\r\n\r\n```java\r\nstatic float parseStringAsFloat(JsonParser parser) throws IOException {\r\n    // TODO: improve when parser.hasTextCharacters()\r\n    return NumberInput.parseFloat(parser.getText(), parser.isEnabled(StreamReadFeature.USE_FAST_DOUBLE_PARSER));\r\n}\r\n\r\nstatic double parseStringAsDouble(JsonParser parser) throws IOException {\r\n    // TODO: improve when parser.hasTextCharacters()\r\n    return NumberInput.parseDouble(parser.getText(), parser.isEnabled(StreamReadFeature.USE_FAST_DOUBLE_PARSER));\r\n}\r\n\r\nstatic BigInteger parseStringAsBigInteger(JsonParser parser) throws IOException {\r\n    // TODO: improve when parser.hasTextCharacters()\r\n    return NumberInput.parseBigInteger(parser.getText(), parser.isEnabled(StreamReadFeature.USE_FAST_BIG_NUMBER_PARSER));\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt would be great to add `char[]` versions `NumberInput#parseFloat`,  `NumberInput#parseDouble`, and  `NumberInput#parseBigInteger`.\r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-core/issues/1229/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-core/issues/1229/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"actor":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder","html_url":"https://github.com/cowtowncoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-06-09T03:30:43Z","updated_at":"2024-06-09T03:30:43Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/4558","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/4558/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/4558/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/4558/events","html_url":"https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind/pull/4558","id":2329131888,"node_id":"PR_kwDOAC5e2c5xMhtp","number":4558,"title":"Allow
