This to minimize any chance of breakage, to require users to opt-in for optimized handling.\n\nSince there hasn't been reports of issues during the time we've had (since 2.14, more than a year), it seems reasonable to assume things work well: so let's enable \"fast FP\" handling by default for 3.0.\nWe can still consider similar change for later 2.x, but let's start with 3.0.\n\n**EDIT**: (2025-04-05)\n\nDue to findings on lack of improvements for writing (equivalent or better code in JDK 21) for newer JDKs, default for `StreamWriteFeature.USE_FAST_DOUBLE_WRITER` will NOT be changed -- it remains `disabled`. Users on JDK 17 can then enable it.\n\n\n","closed_by":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder","html_url":"https://github.com/cowtowncoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-core/issues/1231/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-core/issues/1231/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
