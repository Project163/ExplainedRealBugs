moved from https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/1316 reported by @gmethvin)\n\nWhen I've enabled the `WRITE_BIGDECIMAL_AS_PLAIN` setting on Jackson 2.7.5, Jackson will attempt to write out the whole number, no matter how large the exponent.\n\nFor example, the following code:\n\n``` java\nObjectMapper mapper = new ObjectMapper().enable(JsonGenerator.Feature.WRITE_BIGDECIMAL_AS_PLAIN);\nmapper.writeValueAsString(new java.math.BigDecimal(\"9.223372E+1010671858\"));\n```\n\ntriggers the exception:\n\n```\njava.lang.OutOfMemoryError: Java heap space\n  at java.lang.AbstractStringBuilder.<init>(AbstractStringBuilder.java:68)\n  at java.lang.StringBuilder.<init>(StringBuilder.java:101)\n  at java.math.BigDecimal.toPlainString(BigDecimal.java:2964)\n  at com.fasterxml.jackson.core.json.WriterBasedJsonGenerator.writeNumber(WriterBasedJsonGenerator.java:690)\n  at com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.ser.std.NumberSerializer.serialize(NumberSerializer.java:45)\n  at com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.ser.std.NumberSerializer.serialize(NumberSerializer.java:19)\n  at com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.ser.DefaultSerializerProvider.serializeValue(DefaultSerializerProvider.java:130)\n  at com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.ObjectMapper._configAndWriteValue(ObjectMapper.java:3612)\n  at com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.ObjectMapper.writeValueAsString(ObjectMapper.java:2980)\n  ... 23 elided\n```\n\nI know technically Jackson is doing what you're telling it to do (so if you don't feel this is an issue feel free to close it). But it would be nice if `WRITE_BIGDECIMAL_AS_PLAIN` set a reasonable length on the number, so as not to leave users open to denial of service vulnerabilities.\n\n(Actually, I think this might technically be an issue in jackson-core; let me know if I should resubmit.)\n","closed_by":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder","html_url":"https://github.com/cowtowncoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-core/issues/315/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-core/issues/315/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
