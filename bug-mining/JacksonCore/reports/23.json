Basically, when you're on a FIELD_NAME token, if you call getTokenLocation() and then nextToken() and then getTokenLocation() again, you'll get the same location for both calls to getTokenLocation(), even though you've advanced to a new token.\n\nThe issue seems to be the _nextToken logic in ReaderBasedJsonParser and UTF8StreamJsonParser.  When calling nextToken() on a FIELD_NAME, it calls _nextAfterName(), which updates _currToken but doesn't update _tokenInputRow and _tokenInputCol for the new token's location.\n\nI started to try to fix it, but the _nextToken logic is spread across so much code that it looked like it'd be a pretty major surgery.  Not something I'm willing to do at this point. :-)\n\n```\npublic void testTokenLocationAfterFieldName() throws Exception\n{\n    _testTokenLocationAfterFieldName(false);\n    _testTokenLocationAfterFieldName(true);\n}\n\nprivate void _testTokenLocationAfterFieldName(Boolean useStream) throws Exception\n{\n    final String DOC = \"{\\\"name\\\":123}\";\n    JsonFactory jf = new JsonFactory();\n    JsonParser jp = useStream ?\n            jf.createJsonParser(new ByteArrayInputStream(DOC.getBytes(\"UTF-8\")))\n            : jf.createJsonParser(new StringReader(DOC));\n\n    assertEquals(JsonToken.START_OBJECT, jp.nextToken());\n    assertEquals(JsonToken.FIELD_NAME, jp.nextToken());\n    assertEquals(JsonToken.VALUE_NUMBER_INT, jp.nextToken());\n    assertEquals(1, jp.getTokenLocation().getLineNr());\n    assertEquals(9, jp.getTokenLocation().getColumnNr());\n    jp.close();\n}\n```\n","closed_by":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder","html_url":"https://github.com/cowtowncoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-core/issues/37/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-core/issues/37/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
