While I'm working on CBORParser, I noticed that CBORParser#getTextCharacters() returns sometimes `null` sometimes `[]` (empty array) when it's parsing empty string `\"\"`.\n\nWhile debugging, I noticed that TextBuffer#getTextBuffer behaves inconsistently.\n\n```\nTextBuffer buffer = new TextBuffer(new BufferRecycler());\nbuffer.resetWithEmpty();\nbuffer.getTextBuffer(); // returns null\nbuffer.contentsAsString(); // returns empty string \"\"\nbuffer.getTextBuffer(); // returns empty array []\n```\n\nI think getTextBuffer should return the same value. Not sure which (`null` or `[]`) is expected though.\n","closed_by":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder","html_url":"https://github.com/cowtowncoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-core/issues/182/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-core/issues/182/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
