was doing some fuzz testing and came across an `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`. It seems like it is related to FasterXML/jackson-core/issues/382 in that it has introduced a bug which if the byte[] is a %3 it will still produce an `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`.\r\n\r\nSimple test case as follows: \r\n\r\n```Java\r\npublic void testInvalidInput() throws IOException {\r\n        byte[] data = new byte[7];\r\n        JsonParser parser = FACTORY.createParser(ObjectReadContext.empty(), data);\r\n        parser.nextToken();\r\n        parser.close();\r\n    }\r\n```\r\nStack trace:\r\n```\r\njava.lang.ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException:

com.fasterxml.jackson.core.read.UTF32ParseTest.testInvalidInput(UTF32ParseTest.java:61)\r\n```\r\n\r\nJust for clarity the following test case produces the correct
