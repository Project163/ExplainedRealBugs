Description:**\nAfter upgrading to Jackson 2.19.0, valid `JsonPointer` strings are causing `StringIndexOutOfBoundsException` when calling `head()`.\nThe crash happens due to a negative `suffixLength` calculated in `_constructHead()`.\nThis was not an issue in previous versions (2.18.x and earlier).\n\n```\nCaused by: java.lang.StringIndexOutOfBoundsException: begin 0, end 14, length 6\n    at

com.fasterxml.jackson.core.JsonPointer._constructHead(JsonPointer.java:853)\n    at com.fasterxml.jackson.core.JsonPointer.head(JsonPointer.java:606)\n```\n\n**Reproducer:**\n\n```java\nimport
