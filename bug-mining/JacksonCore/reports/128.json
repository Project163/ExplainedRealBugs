there were reasons to expect `BigDecimalParser` could help handling of very large numbers -- and was consequently added for 2.14 via #814 --  there are concerns that there are cases where its performance is sub-standard.\r\n\r\nIn particular there are concerns with use of large exponents (scientific-notation) which lead to \"big\" numbers but ones that are compact enough (wrt textual representation) not to trigger \"too big number\" guardrails but lead to poor performance.\r\nIf and when regular JDK `BigDecimal` parser does not have similar issues, we may need to remove usage.\r\n\r\nA test case exists to show the issue but I will not include it here: contact me over mailing list(s) for details if interested.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder","html_url":"https://github.com/cowtowncoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-core/issues/967/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-core/issues/967/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
