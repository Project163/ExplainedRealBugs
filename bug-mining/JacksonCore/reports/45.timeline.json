thanks for looking into it. I attempted to add a unit test to demonstrate the problem and verify the fix, but since TokenBuffer.Parser is not part of this module that made it difficult. I tried to contrive a similar scenario but it seems none of the JsonParser implementations in core tolerate an incomplete JSON document as TokenBuffer.Parser does.
