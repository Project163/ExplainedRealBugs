suffered from ArrayIndexOutOfBounds exceptions while decoding JSON with logstash, starting from version 1.5.5.\n\nMy colleague described the problem in: https://discuss.elastic.co/t/json-en-decoding-issues-starting-with-version-1-5-5/36543\n\nNow we could tackle down this issue. The problem is related to https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-core/issues/216, which got fixed with jackson-\\* version 2.6.2.\n\nI filed an issue in jrjackson to update the dependecies: https://github.com/guyboertje/jrjackson/issues/48\n\n**Solution for logstash:**\n\nAs soon as jrjackson is updated, logstash should update to the latest version of jrjackson to fix this issue.\n\n**Steps to reproduce:**\n1. logstash config:\n\n```\ninput {\n  file {\n    codec => json\n    path => \"/tmp/json-parse-problem.input\"\n  }\n}\noutput {\n  stdout {}\n}\n```\n1. start logstash with the above config\n2. provide some input\n\n```\nfor i in `seq 1 120`; do echo '{\"message\":\"'${i}'\", \"test'${i}'\":0}'; done >> /tmp/json-parse-problem.input\n```\n\nThe first message to throw an exception is number 114.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/logstash/issues/4316/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/logstash/issues/4316/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"actor":{"login":"gianm","id":1214075,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMTQwNzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1214075?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm","html_url":"https://github.com/gianm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gianm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-05-12T16:14:53Z","updated_at":"2016-05-12T16:14:53Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/metamx/scala-util/issues/21","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/metamx/scala-util","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/metamx/scala-util/issues/21/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/metamx/scala-util/issues/21/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/metamx/scala-util/issues/21/events","html_url":"https://github.com/metamx/scala-util/pull/21","id":154522967,"node_id":"MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0Njk4NjUxNjQ=","number":21,"title":"Update
