This leads to attempts to print out control characters for binary content: something that has little value but can be annoying and possibly even unsafe in some cases.\r\nAdditionally attempt to print out column/row location are futile as binary formats do not have these concepts.\r\n\r\nFor 2.13 let's change things so that:\r\n\r\n1.
