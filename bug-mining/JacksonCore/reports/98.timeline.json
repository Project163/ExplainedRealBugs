more time to think of what wrapper type to use -- and whether there should be some extension point for more customization since I suspect there are some aspects frameworks might be interested in using

I'm getting a false positive report now with nexus sonarqube\n\n```\nCVE-2025-49128\n com.fasterxml.jackson.core : jackson-core : 2.15.0\nIssue\nCVE-2025-49128\nSeverity\nSonatype CVSS 45.1\nWeakness\nCVE CWE209\nSource\nNational Vulnerability Database\nCategories\nData\nDescription from CVE\nJackson-core contains core low-level incremental (\"streaming\") parser and generator abstractions used by Jackson Data Processor. Starting in version 2.0.0 and prior to version 2.13.0, a flaw in jackson-core's `JsonLocation._appendSourceDesc` method allows up to 500 bytes of unintended memory content to be included in exception messages. When parsing JSON from a byte array with an offset and length, the exception message incorrectly reads from the beginning of the array instead of the logical payload start. This results in possible information disclosure in systems using pooled or reused buffers, like Netty or Vert.x. This issue was silently fixed in jackson-core version 2.13.0, released on September 30, 2021, via PR #652. All users should upgrade to version 2.13.0 or later. If upgrading is not immediately possible, applications can mitigate the issue by disabling exception message exposure to clients to avoid returning parsing exception messages in HTTP responses and/or disabling source inclusion in exceptions to prevent Jackson from embedding any source content in exception messages, avoiding leakage.\n\nExplanation\nThe jackson-core package is vulnerable to Information Exposure due to improper handling of byte array offsets in exception message generation. The _appendSourceDesc() method of the JsonLocation class fails to respect the specified offset and length when including source data in error messages, always reading from the start of the buffer. A local attacker can exploit this vulnerability to obtain sensitive information from previous requests if pooled or reused buffers are used, by triggering a parsing error and inspecting the resulting exception message.\n\nAdvisory Deviation Notice:\nThe Sonatype Security Research team discovered that this vulnerability was introduced in version 2.9.0.pr1 and not 2.0.0 as stated in the advisory.\n\nDetection\nThe application is vulnerable by using this component.\n\nRecommendation\nWe recommend upgrading to a version of this component that is not vulnerable to this specific issue. Alternatively, if upgrading is not a viable option, the project has provided users with the following mitigation guidance:\n\nDisabling exception message exposure to clients — avoid returning parsing exception messages in HTTP responses.\nDisabling source inclusion in exceptions by setting: jsonFactory.disable(JsonFactory.Feature.INCLUDE_SOURCE_IN_LOCATION);\nThis prevents Jackson from embedding any source content in exception messages, avoiding leakage.\n\nReference: https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-core/security/advisories/GHSA-wf8f-6423-gfxg\n\nNote: If this component is included as a bundled/transitive dependency of another component, there may not be an upgrade path. In this instance, we recommend contacting the maintainers who included the vulnerable package. Alternatively, we recommend investigating alternative components or a potential mitigating control.\n\nVersion Affected\n[2.9.0.pr1,2.15.4]\nRoot Cause\njackson-core-2.15.0.jarcom/fasterxml/jackson/core/JsonLocation.class[2.9.0.pr1,2.13.0)\nAdvisories\nProjecthttps://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-core/security/advisories/GHSA-wf8f-6423-gfxg\nCVSS Details\nSonatype CVSS 45.1\nCVSS VectorCVSS:4.0/AV:L/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:N/VC:L/VI:N/VA:N/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N\n```\n\n\nStating 2.15.0 is affected with a change that was addressed in 2.13.0\n\nReaching out to @axsonatype to help address.
