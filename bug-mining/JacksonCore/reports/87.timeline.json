stumbled upon a situation in which I'm not able to get the textual representation of the current token.\r\n\r\nI have the following class:\r\n\r\n```\r\npublic class Test {\r\n    public Boolean value;\r\n    public Boolean getValue() { return value; }\r\n    public void setValue(Boolean value) { this.value = value; }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd the following object mapper:\r\n\r\n```\r\nObjectMapper objectMapper = new ObjectMapper();\r\nobjectMapper.disable(MapperFeature.ALLOW_COERCION_OF_SCALARS);\r\n```\r\n\r\nI'm trying to deserialize something that would result in a `MismatchedInputException`. I'm providing an integer to something that should be a boolean:\r\n\r\n```\r\ntry {\r\n    objectMapper.readValue(\"{ \\\"value\\\": 1 }\", Test.class);\r\n} catch (MismatchedInputException exception) {\r\n    JsonParser parser = (JsonParser) exception.getProcessor();\r\n    System.out.println(parser.currentToken());\r\n    System.out.println(parser.getText());\r\n} catch (Exception exception) {}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis results in:\r\n\r\n```\r\nVALUE_NUMBER_INT\r\n1\r\n```\r\n\r\nas expected.\r\n\r\nWhat's the use case for this you might ask? Whenever the clients of my service send me something incorrect I want to be able to give them detailed information about what went wrong.
