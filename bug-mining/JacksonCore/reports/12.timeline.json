have an owlapi wrapper that translates different ontology formats to OWL/RDF. I recently pull the latest code. had to add the following to my pom.xml to avoid some RDFFormat not found class exception.\n\n```\n</dependency>\n        <dependency> \n        <groupId>net.sourceforge.owlapi</groupId>\n        <artifactId>owlapi-rio</artifactId>\n        <version>4.1.0-RC1</version>\n</dependency>\n```\n\nNot sure if this is an issue or if I am suppose to add this new artifact. It is fine if that is case. But the issue is that this new RDF library/module is generating RDF that does not parse with other tools (i.e: rapper and http://www.w3.org/RDF/Validator/). The problem is with potentially bad encoded XMLLiteral values.\n\nWith owlapi version 4.0.x I was getting:\n\n```\n<Class rdf:about=\"http://bioportal.bioontology.org/ontologies/msotes#class6\">\n        <rdfs:subClassOf rdf:resource=\"http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#Thing\"/>\n</Class>\n<rdf:Description rdf:about=\"http://bioportal.bioontology.org/ontologies/msotes#class6\">\n<rdfs:label>rdfs label value</rdfs:label>\n<rdfs:comment rdf:datatype=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#XMLLiteral\">&lt;ncicp:ComplexDefinition&gt;&lt;ncicp:def-definition&gt;A form of cancer that begin    s in melanocytes (cells that make the pigment melanin). It may begin in a mole (skin melanoma), but can also begin in other pigmented tissues, such as in the eye or in the intestines.&lt;/ncicp:def-definition&gt;&lt;ncicp:def-source&gt;NCI-GLOSS&lt;/ncicp:def-source&gt;&lt;/ncicp:ComplexDefinition&gt;</rdfs:comment>\n<metadata:prefixIRI rdf:datatype=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string\">msotes:class6</metadata:prefixIRI>\n <msotes:mySynonymLabel>syn for class 6</msotes:mySynonymLabel>\n</rdf:Description>\n```\n\nWith 4.1.0 RC1 I get the following:\n\n```\n    <Class rdf:about=\"http://bioportal.bioontology.org/ontologies/msotes#class6\">\n        <rdfs:label>rdfs label value</rdfs:label>\n        <rdfs:comment rdf:datatype=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#XMLLiteral\"><ncicp:ComplexDefinition><ncicp:def-definition>A form of cancer that begins in melanocytes (cells that make the pigment melanin).

Both the rapper tool and the W3C validator failed to parse the 4.1.0RC1 version so I imagine that this is invalid

there a policy regarding how many minor versions APIs are kept for before removal within the 2.x series? Ideally public APIs that existed in 2.0 would still be around in 2.8 (per the defacto standard Semantic Versioning spec) but that hasn't happened here so there needs to be a custom policy for Jackson so users can estimate how many minor versions of Jackson 2.x they are compatible with.\n\nIn my case, the mass removal of public APIs in the following commit (with an incorrect commit message) has caused some of my code to be restricted to compatibility with Jackson 2.3-2.6, as I am using APIs added in 2.3, while also using APIs removed in 2.7.\n\nhttps://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-core/commit/f8d8856524fbaf9b72245ee84fd20c4afa996620\n\nIn that particular commit, deprecations that occurred in 2.6 were removed in 2.7, which seems very sudden given the Jackson status as a widely used library. Does Jackson treat minor versions (2.6/2.7/etc.) as public API incompatible jumps and hence any public API can be removed in a new minor version? Are public APIs preserved across patch versions, ie, 2.6.0 to 2.6.1 will never have public API removals?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-core/issues/308/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-core/issues/308/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
