to https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-core/issues/572\r\n\r\nThere is a new enum that makes the behavior of `FilteringGeneratorDelegate` more customizable. I first called this enum `PathWriteMode`, since it replaces the `_includePath` flag. The options were `NONE` (equivalent to `_includePath=false`), `LAZY` (equivalent to `_includePath=true`), or `EAGER` (write tokens immediately unless a null `TokenFilter` is returned). However, LAZY/EAGER are very tied to how `FilteringGeneratorDelegate` is implemented and may not make intuitive sense unless you're familiar with the implementation.\r\n\r\nI realized that an equivalent way to think about this is in terms of how `TokenFilter` return values should be interpreted. In particular, what does it mean to return a filter that is neither `null` nor `INCLUDE_ALL`? It seems like the options are:\r\n- this means don't include the token (equivalent to `_includePath=false`)\r\n- this means include the token, but only if a child token returns `INCLUDE_ALL` (equivalent to `_includePath=true`)\r\n- this means always include the token (the new behavior I'm looking for)\r\n\r\nSo I made the enum `TokenFilter.Inclusion` inside of `TokenFilter` with options of `ONLY_INCLUDE_ALL`, `INCLUDE_ALL_AND_PATH`, or `INCLUDE_NON_NULL`. I'm also realizing that this enum could apply equally to `FilteringParserDelegate` , so these changes should probably support both reading and writing. I can work on that next, just wanted to make sure everything makes sense so
