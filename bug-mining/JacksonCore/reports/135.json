So, I plan to create a PR shortly which updates existing code that doesn't check the canonicalization setting to use a canonicalizer which will not canonicalize unexpectedly, by only checking `_symbols.isCanonicalizing()` prior to `_symbols.addName`, without adding branching to avoid lookups  (`_symbols._findName`) in other cases. `_findName` is inexpensive on an empty table, and if we see real-world cases that this is problematic, it's possible to improve later on.\r\n\r\nI will plan to make a similar change for the smile-parser in the dataformat-binary project as well. When I make that change, would you prefer if I reference this issue, or create another issue in that project?\r\n\r\nPlease let me know if you'd prefer an approach more similar to https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-core/pull/995/commits/3d565bd39eded1bad35d93eb1f77a96b01f9b14b in which `_findName` is conditionally avoided as well.\r\n\r\nThanks!","closed_by":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder","html_url":"https://github.com/cowtowncoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-core/issues/1015/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-core/issues/1015/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
