like we need to add bit of coordination between `jackson-databind` `ObjectMapper`, `ObjectReader`, `ObjectWriter`, and matching streaming level readers/writers (`JsonParser` / `JsonGenerator`) so that they can share a single `BufferRecycler.\r\nTo untangle dependencies, let's introduce a new simple interface, `Gettable` that can be implemented by input/output source/targets.\r\n\r\nBut initially we specifically need to retrofit just two:\r\n\r\n* `SegmentedStringWriter` (`java.io.Writer`)\r\n* `ByteArrayBuilder`
