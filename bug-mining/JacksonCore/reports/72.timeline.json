I've been trying to reproduce it, and I think I have a way that kinda works. I'm running the existing collision test `com.fasterxml.jackson.core.sym.TestHashCollisionChars`. I added an extra check at the end of `_handleSpillOverflow` to ensure `_size`  matches the content of the hash table, similar to the sanity check in `rehash` that my fuzzer triggered:\r\n\r\n```java\r\n        int count = 0; // let's do sanity check\r\n        int size = _symbols.length;\r\n\r\n        for (int i = 0; i < size; ++i) {\r\n            String symbol = _symbols[i];\r\n            if (symbol != null) {\r\n                ++count;\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        size >>= 1;\r\n        for (int i = 0; i < size; ++i) {\r\n            Bucket b = _buckets[i];\r\n            while (b != null) {\r\n                ++count;\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n       assert(count == _size);\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe assertion fails about 25-50% of the time when I run the test locally. The failures happen when the index passed to `_addSymbol` is odd.\r\n\r\nI now believe the issue is in [`_symbols[bindex + bindex] = newBucket.symbol;`](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-core/blob/master/src/main/java/com/fasterxml/jackson/core/sym/CharsToNameCanonicalizer.java#L526). `bindex` is computed with [`index >> 1` in `_addSymbol`](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-core/blob/master/src/main/java/com/fasterxml/jackson/core/sym/CharsToNameCanonicalizer.java#L493). However, if the index is odd,`bindex + bindex` != `index`. If `_symbols[bindex + bindex]` happened to be null, this essentially adds an element to the hash table instead of replacing an existing one as intended.\r\n\r\nI believe the following fixes the
