For us, this is quite a critical problem.\n\nI’ve done a bit of analysis on this ( it may not be complete but here it is anyway). \n\nThe ByteQuadCanonicalizer has a flag called _needsRehash which determines when they need to size up the internal _names array.  \n- Prior to adding the offending string via addName,   _needsRehash = false. Size of the names is 128 (full)   (clearly it does require a rehash)\n- In addName()  at this point the 2.6.1 ‘fix’ kicks in and sets needRehash = true\n- However at the end of this method we have:\n\n```\nthis._names[offset >> 2] = name;\n++this._count;\nthis._verifyNeedForRehash();\nreturn name;\n```\n\n_verifyNeedForRehash only serves to flip the rehash flag. And even if it did, it is too late because the array accesor here blows up  (first line of code above).  This all occurs before an actual rehash can be performed (hence the blow up), so nothing prevents the exception from occuring (certainly not on this code path anyway).\n\nI hope this helps.   :)

pull request updates the Jackson dependencies from 2.5.3 to 2.6.2.\n\nChangelog:\n- https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson/wiki/Jackson-Release-2.6\n- https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson/wiki/Jackson-Release-2.6.1\n- https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson/wiki/Jackson-Release-2.6.2\n\nJackson 2.6 provides very interesting filtering feature that works with JSON streaming, both at parsing and generating times. Once we move to this version we should be able to reimplement our `filter_path` feature (introduced by #10980) to a more understandable and maintainable implementation.\n\nThe test `TestMergeMapperTests.testConcurrentMergeTest` failed with jackson 2.6.1 with an issue similar to FasterXML/jackson-core#207. After being able [to reproduce the issue in a test](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-core/issues/207#issuecomment-138854278) a fix has been merged in FasterXML/jackson-core#213 and solved the issue.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/13344/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/13344/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":404032992,"node_id":"MDE3OkRlbWlsZXN0b25lZEV2ZW50NDA0MDMyOTky","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-core/issues/events/404032992","actor":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder","html_url":"https://github.com/cowtowncoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"demilestoned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2015-09-08T19:12:44Z","milestone":{"title":"2.2.1"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":404033073,"node_id":"MDE1Ok1pbGVzdG9uZWRFdmVudDQwNDAzMzA3Mw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-core/issues/events/404033073","actor":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder","html_url":"https://github.com/cowtowncoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"milestoned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2015-09-08T19:12:47Z","milestone":{"title":"2.2.1"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":404033131,"node_id":"MDE3OkRlbWlsZXN0b25lZEV2ZW50NDA0MDMzMTMx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-core/issues/events/404033131","actor":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder","html_url":"https://github.com/cowtowncoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"demilestoned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2015-09-08T19:12:51Z","milestone":{"title":"2.2.1"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":404033171,"node_id":"MDE1Ok1pbGVzdG9uZWRFdmVudDQwNDAzMzE3MQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-core/issues/events/404033171","actor":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder","html_url":"https://github.com/cowtowncoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/co
