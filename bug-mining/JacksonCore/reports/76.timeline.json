for 2.10, replaced unsynchronized access with `java.util.concurrent.atomic.AtomicReferenceArray` -- a very simple change, and unlikely to have measurable negative performance effect(s) (and from casual run of `jackson-benchmarks` for reading, saw absolutely no effect).\r\nWith that, enabled recycling for async/non-blocking parser again.\r\n\r\nAlso got rid of all recycling for `JsonStringEncoder` (since it's only used for getting `SerializedString`). For 3.0 (and 2.11 if we do that) will probably try to add fully pluggable abstraction for fetching `BufferRecycler`s using whatever mechanism, could be pooling and not `ThreadLocal`. Or, if somehow I end up having extra time might even still squeeze in 2.10 but only if it gets in a `pr` for thorough

`JsonFactory` -> no error\r\n* Put the following 2 lines inside the `supplyAsync` (so same thread) -> no error\r\n```\r\nJsonParser parser = jsonFactory.createNonBlockingByteArrayParser();\r\nByteArrayFeeder inputFeeder = (ByteArrayFeeder) parser.getNonBlockingInputFeeder();\r\n ```\r\n * with a single thread `ExecutorService executorService = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(1);` -> no error\r\n \r\nI didn't take the time to track deep in jackson, but it seemed that there was some trouble with the `seenNames` being empty when it should not have been.\r\nI don't know if maybe it should not be used this way or if it is a legit error.\r\n\r\nThanks","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-dataformats-binary/issues/384/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-dataformats-binary/issues/384/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
