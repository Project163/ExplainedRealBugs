That means each number can occupy a maximum of (slightly less than) 10KB of space. If I had an array with a lot of these I could still easily see it causing a similar error.\n\nI suspect most users of the `WRITE_BIGDECIMAL_AS_PLAIN` feature are just being anal-retentive about how numbers with smaller exponents look, e.g. `.0012` might look better to them than `1.2E-3` and `12` better than `1.2E1`. But they generally don't want to see 1 followed by 30 zeroes instead of the much more compact `1E30`.\n\nActually, I can't think of any other valid reason to use that setting other than making numbers more human-readable.
