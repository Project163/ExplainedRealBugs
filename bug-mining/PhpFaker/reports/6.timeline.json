What is the reason for this PR?\r\n\r\nThis PR tries to rerun the tests without seeding to detect ones that are not generating valid results.\r\n\r\nThanks to this approach, I found following issues:\r\n\r\n- `regexify` does not handle `[.]` properly (see #133)\r\n- old and new `optional()` behavior does not always match\r\n- `PersonTest` for `mn_MN` locale can fail on different regex collations (`[А-Я]` will not match letter **Ё** on  `C` collation)\r\n- `BiasedTest` is failing with random seed - needs fixing?\r\n\r\n- [x] An improvement to CI (fixes #125)\r\n\r\n### Author's checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] Follow the [Contribution Guide](https://github.com/FakerPHP/Faker/blob/main/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md)\r\n\r\n### Summary of changes\r\n\r\nThere is additional test matrix entry that executes each test 100 times, excluding tests tagged `seed` and `external` (downloading external resource) to ensure they work properly with different seeds.\r\n\r\n`setUp()` method in base `TestCase` class checks if current test is in `seed` group and seeds random number generator with `1` if needed.\r\n\r\n`verbose` mode was disabled by default to limit \"skipped tests\" output spam in the `--repeat 100` job.\r\n\r\n### Review checklist\r\n\r\n- [ ] All checks have passed\r\n- [ ] Changes are approved by
