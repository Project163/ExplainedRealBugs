https://github.com/rust-clique/clap-port-flag/pull/11 we're adding an example of how to use this crate with the Hyper HTTP server. To get it to work, some glue is required:\r\n\r\n```rust\r\n  let args = Cli::from_args();\r\n  let listener = args.port.bind()?;\r\n  let handle = tokio::reactor::Handle::current();\r\n  let listener = tokio::net::TcpListener::from_std(listener, &handle)?;\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis seems like boilerplate that would probably be copy-pasted from between projects, which makes it seem like a prime candidate to create a method for.\r\n\r\nI was thinking something like this:\r\n```rust\r\n  let args = Cli::from_args();\r\n  let listener = args.port.bind_tokio()?;\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe name here could probably use some work (cc/ @killercup, suggestions?) but I reckon the result would be really useful. \r\n\r\nSetting up a complete HTTP server would then only require the following:\r\n```rust\r\n\r\n#[derive(Debug, StructOpt)]\r\nstruct Cli {\r\n  #[structopt(flatten)]\r\n  port: Port,\r\n}\r\n\r\nfn main() -> Result<(), Box<std::error::Error>> {\r\n  let args = Cli::from_args();\r\n  let listener = args.port.bind_tokio()?;\r\n\r\n  let server = Server::builder(listener.incoming())\r\n    .serve(|| service_fn_ok(|_| Response::new(Body::from(\"Hello World\"))))\r\n    .map_err(|e| eprintln!(\"server error: {}\", e));\r\n\r\n  tokio::run(server);\r\n  Ok(())\r\n}\r\n```\r\nWhich I think is starting to become short enough that people can memorize it!\r\n\r\n## Drawbacks\r\nThis would add `tokio` as a dependency which adds a bit of overhead during compilation.

Getting boundaries right for crates is _tricky_!\r\n\r\nI think the core of the issue for us right now is that in `clap-port-flags` we have to choose between exposing a new, specific method just for Hyper support or telling people to copy-paste some boilerplate.\r\n\r\n## Examples\r\nI think showing the problem might work best:\r\n\r\n### Current Usage\r\nThis is the current recommended usage. It's 3 lines using APIs from 3 different sources. For people that are getting started with HTTP, it requires that they understand the difference between sync / async sockets, and that they touch the `hyper::Builder` constructor.\r\n\r\n```rust\r\nuse clap_port_flag::Port;\r\nuse futures::prelude::*;\r\nuse hyper::service::service_fn_ok;\r\nuse hyper::{Body, Response, Server};\r\nuse structopt::StructOpt;\r\n\r\n#[derive(Debug, StructOpt)]\r\nstruct Cli {\r\n  #[structopt(flatten)]\r\n  port: Port,\r\n}\r\n\r\nfn main() -> Result<(), Box<std::error::Error>> {\r\n  // Parse CLI args\r\n  let args = Cli::from_args();\r\n\r\n  // Create TCP socket\r\n  let listener = args.port.bind()?;\r\n  let handle = tokio::reactor::Handle::current();\r\n  let listener = tokio::net::TcpListener::from_std(listener, &handle)?;\r\n\r\n  // Run service\r\n  let server = Server::builder(listener.incoming())\r\n    .serve(|| service_fn_ok(|_| Response::new(Body::from(\"Hello World\"))))\r\n    .map_err(|e| eprintln!(\"server error: {}\", e));\r\n  tokio::run(server);\r\n\r\n  Ok(())\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Tokio in clap-port-flag\r\nIn this version we would integrate all `tokio` code into `clap-port-flag`. It's now only 1 line, and touches 1 crate. It still requires people to know the difference between sync and async sockets, and also relies on the `hyper::Builder` constructor.\r\n\r\n```rust\r\nuse clap_port_flag::Port;\r\nuse futures::prelude::*;\r\nuse hyper::service::service_fn_ok;\r\nuse hyper::{Body, Response, Server};\r\nuse structopt::StructOpt;\r\n\r\n#[derive(Debug, StructOpt)]\r\nstruct Cli {\r\n  #[structopt(flatten)]\r\n  port: Port,\r\n}\r\n\r\nfn main() -> Result<(), Box<std::error::Error>> {\r\n  // Parse CLI args\r\n  let args = Cli::from_args();\r\n\r\n  // Create TCP socket\r\n  let listener = args.port.bind_tokio()?;\r\n\r\n  // Run service\r\n  let server = Server::builder(listener.incoming())\r\n    .serve(|| service_fn_ok(|_| Response::new(Body::from(\"Hello World\"))))\r\n    .map_err(|e| eprintln!(\"server error: {}\", e));\r\n  tokio::run(server);\r\n\r\n  Ok(())\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### std::net::TcpListener support in hyper\r\nThis version would expose a new method on Hyper that accepts a `std::net::TcpListener`. This would be the same as the last example, except the `Server::builder` code is no longer required, and users no longer need to be aware of the differences between sync and async sockets.\r\n\r\n```rust\r\nuse clap_port_flag::Port;\r\nuse futures::prelude::*;\r\nuse hyper::service::service_fn_ok;\r\nuse hyper::{Body, Response, Server};\r\nuse structopt::StructOpt;\r\n\r\n#[derive(Debug, StructOpt)]\r\nstruct Cli {\r\n  #[structopt(flatten)]\r\n  port: Port,\r\n}\r\n\r\nfn main() -> Result<(), Box<std::error::Error>> {\r\n  // Parse CLI args\r\n  let args = Cli::from_args();\r\n\r\n  // Create TCP socket, and run service\r\n  let server = Server::listen(args.port.bind()?)\r\n    .serve(|| service_fn_ok(|_| Response::new(Body::from(\"Hello World\"))))\r\n    .map_err(|e| eprintln!(\"server error: {}\", e));\r\n  tokio::run(server);\r\n\r\n  Ok(())\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Wrapping Up\r\nI hope this somewhat explains what we're running into. I can't claim to know what the right solution is, given I don't know all the constraints Hyper itself is facing. But I do think it'd be great if we could figure out a way to make all this setup easier! I def hope it makes sense where I'm coming from.\r\n\r\nThanks again for your time!","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hyperium/hyper/issues/comments/405530736/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"yoshuawuyts","id":2467194,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NjcxOTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2467194?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yoshuawuyts","html_url":"https://github.com/yoshuawuyts","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yoshuawuyts/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yoshuawuyts/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yoshuawuyts/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yoshuawuyts/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yoshuawuyts/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yoshuawuyts/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yoshuawuyts/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yoshuawuyts/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yoshuawuyts/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hyperium/hyper/issues/comments/405664377","html_url":"https://github.com/hyperium/hyper/issues/1602#issuecomment-405664377","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hyperium/hyper/issues/1602","id":405664377,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQwNTY2NDM3Nw==","user":{"login":"seanmonstar","id":51479,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxNDc5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/51479?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar","html_url":"https://github.com/seanmonstar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-07-17T17:35:18Z","updated_at":"2018-07-17T17:35:18Z","body":"I think the last option seems the nicest, since it is sort of boilerplate to just convert a `std::net::TcpListener` into a tokio one.

:wave:, this implements https://github.com/hyperium/hyper/issues/1602. I'm pretty sure there's a few rough edges to this PR, but I wanted to kick things off anyway.\r\n\r\n## Questions\r\n### Error handling\r\nThe result type for `from_tcp()` is now:\r\n```rust\r\nResult<Builder<tokio_tcp::Incoming>, Box<dyn error::Error>> {\r\n```\r\nI wasn't sure what the best way to approach the errors was; any pointers here would be fantastic!\r\n\r\n### Runtime Features\r\nI wasn't sure what the runtime features are for (`no_std` related perhaps?), but figured I'd follow the prior art and add them where it seemed appropriate.\r\n\r\n### Rustfmt\r\nRustfmt tends to run on every save; sorry if it changed things it shouldn't have. Happy to go back in and revert changes - but also happy to leave it if it doesn't matter :grin:\r\n\r\n### Method name\r\nI ended up going with `.from_tcp()` because I felt it was the most descriptive, but happy to change it to any other method if people feel that's more appropriate!\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\nI only tested this on an example application to make sure it works. What would be the best way to test this?\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nHope this is helpful!
