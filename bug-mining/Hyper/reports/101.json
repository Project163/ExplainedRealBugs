There's a [`select`](https://github.com/hyperium/hyper/blob/35e23b78d569122cadda4f4481204b6ad0a9c6fa/src/client/mod.rs#L157) to take a connection from the pool and in parallel attempt a new connection, returning whichever is successful first. I think that the race here is what's causing the nondeterminism, and the problem is happening when the pooled connection here is pulled out.\r\n\r\nThe pooled connection is guaranteed to return a failure (e.g. broken pipe) b/c the connection is closed on the remote end. Is this a problem in general with pooled connections? Is there a location where the health of the connection is tested before it's used?
