I did this\r\nTrying to transfer 3 URLs like:\r\n```\r\nhttps://api.adsb.lol/api/0/route/SAS4133 \r\nhttps://api.adsb.lol/api/0/route/BBD6810\r\nhttps://api.adsb.lol/api/0/route/THY19Y\r\n```\r\nto get Airplane flight-information (in series or parallel), causes curl to hang for a really long time between each URL.\r\nBut only when built with `-DUSE_HYPER` !? Entering the URLs either from a config-file or set on the command-line doesn't matter.\r\nA simple `get-urls.bat` file to reproduce:\r\n```bat\r\n@echo off\r\nsetlocal\r\nset CURL_SSL_BACKEND=schannel\r\necho url=https://api.adsb.lol/api/0/route/SAS4133  > %TEMP%\\curl_urls.txt\r\necho url=https://api.adsb.lol/api/0/route/BBD6810 >> %TEMP%\\curl_urls.txt\r\necho url=https://api.adsb.lol/api/0/route/THY19Y  >> %TEMP%\\curl_urls.txt\r\ncurl -s -K - < %TEMP%\\curl_urls.txt | grep \"_airport_codes_iata\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nRunning the above `.bat` file takes at least 1 minute to complete! With `--parallel` or not.\r\n\r\n### I expected the following\r\nThe transfer to complete in < 1 sec. as the `curl.exe` bundled with Win-10 does:\r\n```\r\ntimer & c:\\windows\\system32\\curl.exe -s https://api.adsb.lol/api/0/route/SAS4133 https://api.adsb.lol/api/0/route/BBD6810 https://api.adsb.lol/api/0/route/THY19Y | grep \"_airport_codes_iata\"  & timer\r\nTimer 1 on:  9:42:26\r\n  \"_airport_codes_iata\": \"CGN-BLL-KEF\",\r\n  \"_airport_codes_iata\": \"SFO-IST\",\r\n  \"_airport_codes_iata\": \"BGO-SVG\",\r\nTimer 1 off:  9:42:26  Elapsed: 0:00:00,45\r\n\r\nc:\\windows\\system32\\curl -V\r\ncurl 8.0.1 (Windows) libcurl/8.0.1 Schannel WinIDN\r\nRelease-Date: 2023-03-20\r\n```\r\n\r\nAdding the `--parallel` option I'd assume the URLs would be issued in parallel. Doesn't look so to me.\r\n\r\n###  Version info:\r\n```\r\ncurl -V\r\ncurl 8.2.0-DEV (x86_64-pc-win32) libcurl/8.2.0-DEV (OpenSSL/3.2.0) Schannel \r\n  (rustls-ffi/0.10.0/rustls/0.21.0) zlib/1.2.12 brotli/1.0.9 zstd/1.5.2 c-ares/1.19.0 libssh2/1.10.1_DEV Hyper/1.0.0-rc.3\r\nRelease-Date: [unreleased]\r\nProtocols: dict file ftp ftps gopher gophers http https imap imaps ldap ldaps mqtt pop3 pop3s scp sftp smb smbs smtp \r\n  smtps telnet tftp ws wss\r\nFeatures: alt-svc AsynchDNS brotli HSTS HTTP2 HTTPS-proxy Kerberos Largefile libz MultiSSL NTLM SPNEGO SSL SSPI threadsafe \r\n  TLS-SRP UnixSockets zstd\r\n```\r\n\r\nI'm on Windows-10, 22H2 (OS-build 19045.2965).\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/11203/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/curl/curl/issues/11203/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hyperium/hyper/issues/comments/1775493965","html_url":"https://github.com/hyperium/hyper/issues/3369#issuecomment-1775493965","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hyperium/hyper/issues/3369","id":1775493965,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAWaYQc5p0-NN","user":{"login":"seanmonstar","id":51479,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxNDc5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/51479?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar","html_url":"https://github.com/seanmonstar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-10-23T15:45:13Z","updated_at":"2023-10-23T15:45:13Z","body":"Wow, thanks so much for the write-up, and finding this deadlock!

the ETH and Bern, we got reports of Tobira randomly stopping to work. No more log outputs are happening, and HTTP requests are not responded to anymore at all. The process still runs, but it seems like it's not doing anything anymore. Log does not have any relevant entries.\r\n\r\nBern is running v2.5 (where it first occurred AFAIK), while ETH is running v2.6 (and they apparently did not see that problem on v2.5). Both are running it behind an nginx. From ETH I heard that it could happen immediately, or after hours or days. Bern reported it failing on roughly 26.02. 17:27, 22.02. 21:10 and 10.02. 16:53. \r\n\r\nPlaying around on the ETH system right now, I could somewhat reliably cause the problem to occur by immediately refreshing the page after restarting Tobira. I couldn't yet identify a relevant HTTP request, but assume that it's a graphql request. The `index.html` was almost (I think?) delivered correctly. The problem also occurred with the -musl build of v2.6. ETH observed that the memory-usage as reported by `systemctl status` was at only 784KB for the frozen Tobira, but 50MB for a normally running one. I did not see those numbers in my experiments, but it might still be useful information. The frozen process does not consume any noticeable CPU time (i.e. not a full core, for example).\r\n\r\nI now deployed a MUSL build of 97d28b28cecaac6c5d16622877b9e5434aad2896 which is just v2.6 + #1120. There we update Tokio and hyper, two prime candidates for causing things like that. So far I could not reproduce the problem, I think? I will see if it continues to work for a few days. \r\n\r\nI have not yet gone through the changelogs of Tokio and hyper, but will do so soon. Other things I have planned to debug this:\r\n- Get a Tobira into the frozen state and poke at it in various ways, using `strace` and friends to see what's happening.\r\n- Enable more logs/tracing from dependencies of Tobira (Tokio, hyper, ...).","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elan-ev/tobira/issues/1129/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/elan-ev/tobira/issues/1129/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
