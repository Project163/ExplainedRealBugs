Quoting [RFC 7230, section 3.3.2](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7230#section-3.3.2) 6th paragraph: \r\n\r\n> A server MUST NOT send a Content-Length header field in any response\r\n> with a status code of 1xx (Informational) or 204 (No Content).  A\r\n> server MUST NOT send a Content-Length header field in any 2xx\r\n> (Successful) response to a CONNECT request (Section 4.3.6 of\r\n> [RFC7231]).\r\n\r\nAt this moment the content-length header is set for 101 Switch Protocols responses. The resulting issue is that e.g. with a warp WebSocket server, a .Net client will drop the connection after 100 seconds: https://stackoverflow.com/a/44553521/85514 . \r\n\r\nI believe the solution should be similar to [b342c38f], and I'm willing to make a PR to do that. However, I'm not familiar enough with the code base to see if that would fix the problem / has any other implications.","closed_by":{"login":"seanmonstar","id":51479,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxNDc5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/51479?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar","html_url":"https://github.com/seanmonstar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hyperium/hyper/issues/2215/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hyperium/hyper/issues/2215/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
