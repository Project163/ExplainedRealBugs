If it returns `Some(len)`, check if the headers contain `CONTENT_LENGTH`, and if not, add the header with the serialized length.\r\n- Do the same in `proto::h2::client`, before calling `SendRequest::send_request`.\r\n- Serializing into a header value can make use of `hyper::headers::content_length_value`.\r\n- A new function, `set_content_length_if_not_present`, could probably be added to `hyper::headers`, making use of `HeaderMap::entry`.","closed_by":{"login":"seanmonstar","id":51479,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxNDc5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/51479?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar","html_url":"https://github.com/seanmonstar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hyperium/hyper/issues/1547/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hyperium/hyper/issues/1547/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
