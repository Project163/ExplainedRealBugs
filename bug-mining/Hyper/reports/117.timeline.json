playing around with Hyper's Tokio integration, but I'm running into a hiccup when trying to test my service. What I want to do is pass in a specially crafted `Request`, then just `.wait()` the future and check the result. But it seems like the only way to test a service is to create a full server (listening on a TCP socket) and send it a string for it to parse as a request.\r\n\r\nThat feels much more like an integration test to me, and it would be really nice to be able to test services (especially middleware) in isolation, with explicit requests, and expected responses.\r\n\r\nIs there a reason behind exposing no interface for creating requests?

I merged them by making the final `Request` use `Option<Body>` and added the `Default` trait to `Body`. Unfortunately, this makes the formerly-concise `req.body()`, as seen in `test/server.rs#117`, a lengthy `req.take_body().unwrap_or_default()`. \r\n\r\nI also re-exported `Request` and `Response` to minimize breaking changes, but this has the side-effect of being visible from 3 locations: `hyper`, `hyper::server`, and `hyper::client`).\r\n\r\nThoughts?\r\n\r\n- [x] The commit messages match the guidelines in https://github.com/hyperium/hyper/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#git-commit-guidelines\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hyperium/hyper/issues/1162/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hyperium/hyper/issues/1162/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":1064773791,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MTA2NDc3Mzc5MQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hyperium/hyper/issues/events/1064773791","actor":{"login":"seanmonstar","id":51479,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxNDc5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/51479?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar","html_url":"https://github.com/seanmonstar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":"864d3e27a437d2274f91201cda495887a8ba27e5","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hyperium/hyper/commits/864d3e27a437d2274f91201cda495887a8ba27e5","created_at":"2017-05-02T01:32:29Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
