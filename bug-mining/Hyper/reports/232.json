This has some downsides that I'd like to address with a modified API:\r\n\r\n- It makes the `Body` type fatter.\r\n- It requires people keep the `Body` around, meaning they can't use stream combinators to read the body first, *and then* wait for the upgrade to finish. This also makes it more annoying for users who may wish adjust their `http::Request<Body>` into some `http::Request<Doodad>`.\r\n\r\n## Proposed API\r\n\r\nSimilar to the proposal in #1586, the change would be to pass the `http::Request` or `http::Response` to a free function.\r\n\r\n- `hyper::upgrade::on(req_or_resp) -> OnUpgrade`\r\n  - We can also allow passing just a mutable reference, thus not consuming the request or response.\r\n- Optional other functions could be added, but not necessary: `has_upgrade`, etc.\r\n\r\n## Implementation Plan\r\n\r\nThe types would be inserted into the `http::Extensions` of the request/response (though with a private wrapper type to hide the exact details).\r\n\r\n- Add the new `hyper::upgrade::on` function.\r\n- The `Body::on_upgrade` method would become `#[deprecated]`.\r\n- So as to not be a behavioral breaking change, the `OnUpgrade` would need to be placed in both the `Body` *and* the `Extensions`, wrapped in some `Arc<Lock>` that only allows taking it once.\r\n\r\nI'd like to in a future release be able to *not* put it in an `Arc<Lock>` and place it in the `Body`, but I'm not sure how that could really be done in 0.13.x. (I knew I'd find something I forgot to change after finally releasing XD).","closed_by":{"login":"seanmonstar","id":51479,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxNDc5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/51479?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar","html_url":"https://github.com/seanmonstar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hyperium/hyper/issues/2086/reactions","total_count":3,"+1":3,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hyperium/hyper/issues/2086/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
