My experience with Rust is very small - about month.\nCurrently my issue is: when some thread panic, all other threads (in Iron) became useless - I can't lock Arc<Mutex<Resource>> anymore. I can catch it but I can't do anything useful except send 503 response to user. Good solution would automatically \"restart\" thread - kill poisoned thread, instantiate new mutex for resource object. Or, if it's not possible - just ask main thread to die, to let monitoring daemon restart
