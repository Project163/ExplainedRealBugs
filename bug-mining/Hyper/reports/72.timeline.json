like to tackle this one.\n\nI started looking at the spec, and I realized there is only ever one valid value for this header. For example, this value could never be false.\n\nGiven that invariant, I would probably want users to set this header without needing to pass in a bool. Ex:\n\n```\nextern crate hyper;\n\nuse hyper::header::{Headers, AccessControlAllowCredentials};\n\nfn main() {\n    let mut headers = Headers::new();\n    headers.set(AccessControlAllowCredentials);\n}\n```\n\nHowever, we probably would want to parse raw AccessControlAllowCredentials headers values of any case. For example an HTTP client should probably still parse this sort of response:\n\n```\nHTTP/1.1 200
