is an analog of #1145 which was about the `Cookie` header. The current type is a direct wrapper over the vector of `Set-Cookie` headers. From some client uses, it would be nice to have a cookie name based lookup, as well as accessors for the \"standard\" cookie attributes. For server use, it would be nice to expose a builder-type interface to add cookies and set attributes.\r\n\r\nIt needs some thought to avoid allocations / copies to the degree that makes sense / impossible, but I think the convenience is worth a small penalty for many uses. A possible rough interface:\r\n\r\n```rust\r\nimpl SetCookie {\r\n  pub fn get<K: AsRef<[u8]>(&self, key: K) -> Option<CookieValue> { unimplemented!(); }\r\n  pub fn add<K: AsRef<[u8]>(&self, key: K) -> CookieBuilder  { unimplemented!(); }\r\n}\r\n\r\npub struct CookieValue(/* TBD */);\r\nimpl CookieValue {\r\n  pub fn http_only(&self) -> bool  { unimplemented!(); }\r\n  pub fn domain(&self) -> Option<&str>  { unimplemented!(); }\r\n  pub fn extension(&self) -> Option<&str>  { unimplemented!(); }\r\n  // ...\r\n}\r\n\r\npub struct CookieBuilder(/* TBD */);\r\nimpl CookieBuilder {\r\n  pub fn http_only(&mut self, http_only: bool) -> &mut CookieBuilder  { unimplemented!(); }\r\n  pub fn domain<S: AsRef<str>>(&mut self, domain: S) -> &mut CookieBuilder  { unimplemented!(); }\r\n  pub fn extension(&mut self, extension: S) -> &mut CookieBuilder  { unimplemented!(); }\r\n  // ...\r\n}\r\n\r\n// Maybe for ergonomics?\r\nimpl Drop for CookieBuilder {\r\n  pub fn drop(&mut self) {\r\n    // Add the cookie to the storage in `SetCookie`.\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hyperium/hyper/issues/1337/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hyperium/hyper/issues/1337/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
