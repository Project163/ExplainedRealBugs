includes a custom BufReader, since the one in libstd doesn't allow\nreading additional data into the buffer without consuming it. This is\nrequired because some connections may send shorter packets, and so we\nneed to perform multiple reads. After each read, the contents of the\nbuffer are passed to httparse to see if have a valid message. If so, the\nproper amount of bytes are consumed. The additional bytes are left in\nthe buffer since they are the beginning of the body.\n\nThe buffer in this BufReader also grows in size, compared to the libstd\nwhich is sized once. This is because we start with a smaller buffer,\nsince the majority of messages will be able to include their head in a\npacket or 2. Therefore, it's a wasteful performance hit to allocate the\nmaximum size for every message. However, some headers can be quite big,\nand to allow for many of them to be set, we include a maximum size. Once\nwe've hit the maximum buffer size, and still haven't determined the end\nof the headers, a HttpTooLargeError will be returned.\n\nCloses #389\n\ncc @reem @r-darwish\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hyperium/hyper/issues/401/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hyperium/hyper/issues/401/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":267665716,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MjY3NjY1NzE2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hyperium/hyper/issues/events/267665716","actor":{"login":"seanmonstar","id":51479,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxNDc5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/51479?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar","html_url":"https://github.com/seanmonstar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2015-03-28T18:37:43Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
