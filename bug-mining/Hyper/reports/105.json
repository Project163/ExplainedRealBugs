If this can be handled to implement `From<Message> for Request` then Hyper could leverage support in https://github.com/tokio-rs/tokio-proto/pull/130 to use `TcpServer` directly, especially when working with TLS connections where Hyper's conveniences won't be available.\r\n\r\nTalking with @carllerche over lunch today one idea was to have the socket address be a member of the messages coming from the `Stream` going into tokio-proto. That way the message itself would contain the socket address. I could imagine this being implemented via a trait bound in Hyper perhaps? \r\n\r\nWhat do you think?","closed_by":{"login":"seanmonstar","id":51479,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxNDc5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/51479?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar","html_url":"https://github.com/seanmonstar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hyperium/hyper/issues/1036/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hyperium/hyper/issues/1036/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
