Bug Report\r\n\r\n### What is the issue?\r\n\r\nWhen a client send a get query with a body using chunked transfer encoding, linkerd-proxy forward the query without using chunk and without  content-length header.\r\n\r\nThe backend server wants a body but does not see it as there is  no content-length header.\r\n\r\n### How can it be reproduced?\r\n\r\nWe can forge query with curl  : \r\n```\r\n# curl -H'Conten0/_mget  -d '{\"docs\": [{\"_id\": \"foo\", \"_index\": \"bar\"]}' -vGET http://10.3.56.59:9200\r\n*   Trying 10.3.56.59...\r\n* TCP_NODELAY set\r\n* Connected to 10.3.56.59

             |\n\nVulnerable versions of hyper allow GET requests to have bodies, even if there is\nno Transfer-Encoding or Content-Length header.  As per the HTTP 1.1\nspecification, such requests do not have bodies, so the body will be interpreted\nas a separate HTTP request.\n\nThis allows an attacker who can control the body and method of an HTTP request\nmade by hyper to inject a request with headers that would not otherwise be\nallowed, as demonstrated by sending a malformed HTTP request from a Substrate\nruntime.  This allows bypassing CORS restrictions.  In combination with other\nvulnerabilities, such as an exploitable web server listening on loopback, it may\nallow remote code execution.\n\nThe flaw was corrected in hyper version 0.12.34.\n\n\nSee

As per the HTTP 1.1\nspecification, such requests do not have bodies, so the body will be interpreted\nas a separate HTTP request.\n\nThis allows an attacker who can control the body and method of an HTTP request\nmade by hyper to inject a request with headers that would not otherwise be\nallowed, as demonstrated by sending a malformed HTTP request from a Substrate\nruntime.  This allows bypassing CORS restrictions.

Flaw in hyper allows request smuggling by sending a body in GET requests\n\n| Details             |                                                |\n| ------------------- |

            |\n| Unaffected versions | `<0.11.0`               |\n\nVulnerable versions of hyper allow GET requests to have bodies, even if there is\nno Transfer-Encoding or Content-Length header.  As per the HTTP 1.1\nspecification, such requests do not have bodies, so the body will be interpreted\nas a separate HTTP request.\n\nThis allows an attacker who can control the body and method of an HTTP request\nmade by hyper to inject a request with headers that would not otherwise be\nallowed, as demonstrated by sending a malformed HTTP request from a Substrate\nruntime.  This allows bypassing CORS restrictions.  In combination with other\nvulnerabilities, such as an exploitable web server listening on loopback, it may\nallow remote code execution.\n\nThe flaw was corrected in hyper version 0.12.34.\n\nSee
