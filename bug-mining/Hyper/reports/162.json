While the default is to use auto-detection of writev, the detection must happen on every connection, and for shorter lived connections, it'd be better to configure it off from the start.\r\n\r\nThis issue is just to add a same kind of config for the server side, by adding `hyper::server::conn::Http::http1_writev(enabled: bool)`.
