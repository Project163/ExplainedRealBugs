removes the need to receive `&mut self` in `get_ref` and `get.`\n\nSince the interior mutability of the RWLock is needed only once, it is safe\nto change the lifetime of the pointer given by read locks as by then all\nmutation has been done.\n\nSince `set` still requires `&mut self` there is no way to use the interior\nmutability of the RWLock to modify an existing `&`-reference. However, the\nuse of interior mutability in `get_ref` means that `get_raw` is now\nactually an unsafe operation because the (now `*const`) pointer could be\ninvalidated by a subsequent call to `get_ref.`\n\nCommit 2ed2cd0 also fixed a possible race condition in this new scheme and\nprevents duplicate parsing. From the commit message:\n\nIf two threads attempted to `get_ref` the same Header under two\nrepresentations, then it was possible that the second thread would\noverwrite the work of the first thread, causing the first thread to do an\nunchecked downcast to the wrong type.\n\nIn the case where they were the same Header representation, then the only\ndamage would be that it would be parsed twice and would possibly return a\nfalse negative in one thread.\n\nThe new code checks that it was not a queued lock and will not override the\nwork of another thread, but will accept it if the other thread parsed the\nheader as the same type, thus also preventing duplicate parsing.\n\nCommit 4b901ae also adds new tests for double-reads of the same header\nand reads of two different headers as a sanity check that no deadlocks\nwere created in this refactor.\n\nFinally, commit abba94f renames `get_ref` to `get` and removes cloning `get` since\nit is no longer needed and b2f81a4 adds `get_mut` which gets an `&mut` reference to\nthe header data.\n\nfixes #47
