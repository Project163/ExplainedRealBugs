this:\r\n1. It requires enabling the \"unstable-stream\" feature. The name make it sound like it is more unstable than the rest of the crate, but afaict, streams are stable in the upstream tokio and futures crates.\r\n2. Having to map over the Stream to convert the `Result<BytesMut, _>` to `Result<Bytes, _>` is unergonomic, especially since this pattern needs to be done each time an `AsyncRead` is sent as a `Body` (unless a custom `Decoder` is written to decode to `Chunk`s or something).\r\n\r\nFor 1, I think that either the feature flag should be removed, or there should be better documentation on why it exists.\r\n\r\nFor 2, the easiest solutions would be to either implement `From<BytesMut>` for `Chunk`, or do #1931. Another option is to add direct support for `AsyncRead` to `Body` (See #1328).\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hyperium/hyper/issues/2008/reactions","total_count":7,"+1":4,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":3},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hyperium/hyper/issues/2008/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"actor":{"login":"bstrie","id":865233,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg2NTIzMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/865233?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bstrie","html_url":"https://github.com/bstrie","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bstrie/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bstrie/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bstrie/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bstrie/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bstrie/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bstrie/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bstrie/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bstrie/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bstrie/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-12-05T18:39:25Z","updated_at":"2019-12-05T18:39:25Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hyperium/hyper/issues/2046","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hyperium/hyper","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hyperium/hyper/issues/2046/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hyperium/hyper/issues/2046/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hyperium/hyper/issues/2046/events","html_url":"https://github.com/hyperium/hyper/pull/2046","id":533524742,"node_id":"MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0MzQ5NTgzNjk1","number":2046,"title":"refactor(body):
