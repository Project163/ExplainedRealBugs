This could be useful to skip checking for trailers if the request never said it supports them.\r\n  - It's likely that new state will need to be added, in case the data is done, but polling the trailers is `Pending`.\r\n- Add `proto::h1::Conn::write_trailers()` [after `write_body()`](https://github.com/hyperium/hyper/blob/f1b89c117cffebed4b2b8eb2d221fd9b25c1d3d1/src/proto/h1/conn.rs#L626). The dispatcher would call this.\r\n- Add [`proto::h1::Encoder::encode_trailers()`](https://github.com/hyperium/hyper/blob/f1b89c117cffebed4b2b8eb2d221fd9b25c1d3d1/src/proto/h1/encode.rs#L51) that flattens the `HeaderMap` into a `Buf`.\r\n  - A few unit tests for encoding trailers in the `encode` file.\r\n- A couple tests, at least one in each of `tests/client.rs` and `tests/server.rs` that both sides can send trailers.","closed_by":{"login":"seanmonstar","id":51479,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxNDc5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/51479?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar","html_url":"https://github.com/seanmonstar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hyperium/hyper/issues/2719/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hyperium/hyper/issues/2719/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
