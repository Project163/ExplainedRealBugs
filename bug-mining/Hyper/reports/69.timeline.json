encountered using:\nrustc 1.0.0-beta (9854143cb 2015-04-02) (built 2015-04-02)\nhyper, version 0.3.9\nOS X 10.10.2, fully updated as of issue creation\nGoogle Chrome, version 41.0.2272.118 (64-bit)\nWireshark, version 1.12.4 (from macports)\n\nI looked at the hyper issue backlog and this might be related to issue #368, however I'm not sure if that issue implicates the hyper server as the problem, while this ticket may do that.\n\nThe http server in the reproduction code below serves \"/\" with a simple HTML file that references a lot of non-existing scripts (a1.js through a25.js). When the browser tries to fetch them, it gets 404s.\n\nWhen loading 127.0.0.1:1234 in Chrome, the root HTML and most of the aXX.js requests finish, but 5 of them are always pending for a long time. They then finish one by one in exact 5 minute intervals.\n\nUsing wireshark, I saw that all the finished requests (whether 200s or 404s) were performed over the same TCP connection. All stalled/pending requests were using one TCP connection per request.\n\nThe GET requests from the browser were sent immediately upon the openings of the TCP connections, however the replies were delayed the aforementioned multiples of 5 minutes. The replies were timestamped correctly in the returned HTTP headers (i.e. exactly when they appeared in the TCP stream), so they were actually written to the TCP buffer when they appeared in the stream (hopefully ruling out immediate writes that were delayed due to lack of flushing or similar). It seems like the hyper server is delaying its writing of replies, but I don't know why.\n\nI found some (possibly outdated) information on the Internet about Google Chrome having a max 6 connection per origin policy, so that may be related to the fact that the first opened TCP connection (the one requesting \"/\") is successfully reused for all requests except for the 5 of them that get their own connections (and delayed replies) in an attempt to parallellize the fetching.\n\nI tested a bit with Firefox as well, but the results were inconclusive so I have nothing actionable to say about them.\n\nIf you want more details or if I've made some mistake, just shout. My reply may be slow, as I'm on Europe time. I'd love some help with this, as it's currently a show stopper for my (admittedly unimportant pet) project.\n\nThanks a lot for working on Rust and its ecosystem!\n\nHere's the reproduction code.

Down the Rabbit-Hole  Alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on the bank, and of having nothing to do: once or twice she had peeped into the book her sister was reading, but it had no pictures or conversations in it, <and what is the use of a book,> thought Alice <without pictures or conversations?> So she was considering in her own mind (as well as she could, for the hot day made her feel very sleepy and stupid), whether the pleasure of making a daisy-chain would be worth the trouble of getting up and picking the daisies, when suddenly a White Rabbit with pink eyes ran close by her. There was nothing so very remarkable in that; nor did Alice think it so very much out of the way to hear the Rabbit say to itself, <Oh dear! Oh dear! I shall be late!> (when she thought it over afterwards, it occurred to her that she ought to have wondered at this, but at the time it all seemed quite natural); but when the Rabbit actually took a watch out of its waistcoat-pocket, and looked at it, and then hurried on, Alice started to her feet, for it flashed across her mind that she had never before seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat-pocket, or a watch to take out of it, and burning with curiosity, she ran across the field after it, and fortunately was just in time to see it pop down a large rabbit-hole under the hedge. In another moment down went Alice after it, never once considering how in the world she was to get out again. The rabbit-hole went straight on like a tunnel for some way, and then dipped suddenly down, so suddenly that Alice had not a moment to think about stopping herself before she found herself falling down a very deep well. Either the well was very deep, or she fell very slowly, for she had plenty of time as she went down to look about her and to wonder what was going to happen next. First, she tried to look down and make out what she was coming to, but it was too dark to see anything; then she looked at the sides of the well, and noticed that they were filled with cupboards......\")))\n    }).http(\"172.16.0.1:8080\").unwrap();\n}\n```\n\nOn the following version of rust:\n\n```\n[jlouis@daemonette rust]$ rustc -vV\nrustc 1.0.0-nightly (a52182ffd 2015-04-17) (built 2015-04-17)\nbinary: rustc\ncommit-hash: a52182ffdedaabb3b72a11e8a67a411124ecb9ac\ncommit-date: 2015-04-17\nbuild-date: 2015-04-17\nhost: x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu\nrelease: 1.0.0-nightly\n```\n\nThe `Cargo.lock` file is down at the bottom of this, which I hope is enough for reproduction.\n\nRunning wrk on the data obtains a good result (10k connections, 15 seconds, as fast as possible):\n\n```\n[jlouis@lady-of-pain WebFrameworkBenchmark]$ wrk -t8 -c10000 -d15s http://172.16.0.1:8080/                 Running 15s test @ http://172.16.0.1:8080/\n  8 threads and 10000 connections\n  Thread Stats   Avg      Stdev     Max   +/- Stdev\n    Latency   354.72us  535.78us 201.53ms   99.73%\n    Req/Sec    44.90k     3.23k   46.94k    96.00%\n  669907 requests in 15.03s, 1.35GB read\n  Socket errors: connect 0, read 9485, write 764, timeout 0\nRequests/sec:  44580.66\nTransfer/sec:     91.71MB\n```\n\nBut if I take Gil Tene's wrk2 (https://github.com/giltene/wrk2), and ask for a request rate of 30000 req/s on 10000 connections, then Iron fails to obtain any sizeable number of connections:\n\n```\n[jlouis@lady-of-pain WebFrameworkBenchmark]$ wrk2 -t8 -c10000 -d60s -R 30000 http://172.16.0.1:8080/       \nRunning 1m test @ http://172.16.0.1:8080/\n  8 threads and 10000 connections\n  Thread calibration: mean lat.: 1.246ms, rate sampling interval: 10ms\n  Thread calibration: mean lat.: 1.265ms, rate sampling interval: 10ms\n  Thread calibration: mean lat.: 1.235ms, rate sampling interval: 10ms\n  Thread calibration: mean lat.: 1.179ms, rate sampling interval: 10ms\n  Thread calibration: mean lat.: 9223372036854776.000ms, rate sampling interval: 10ms\n  Thread calibration: mean lat.: 9223372036854776.000ms, rate sampling interval: 10ms\n  Thread calibration: mean lat.: 9223372036854776.000ms, rate sampling interval: 10ms\n  Thread calibration: mean lat.: 1.104ms, rate sampling interval: 10ms\n  Thread Stats   Avg      Stdev     Max   +/- Stdev\n    Latency     1.20ms  408.35us   2.48ms   68.42%\n    Req/Sec     6.25     32.88   333.00     96.08%\n  2885 requests in 1.00m, 5.93MB read\n  Socket errors: connect 0, read 84, write 75042, timeout 190018\nRequests/sec:     47.88\nTransfer/sec:    100.85KB\n```\n\nIn fact, it produces many many connection timeouts. Testing the same workload with the following webservers work as expected (do mind kernel tuning), on a setup with two physical machines sharing a 1 gigabit wired connection, which has been load tested beforehand:\n- Go 1.4.2 net/http package\n- JVM 8u40 undertow.io\n- Erlang 17.5.1, cowboy 1.x\n- Node.js v0.12.2 running in a cluster.js configuration\n\nI _think_ the problem is coordinated omission in `wrk` together with Iron's inability to handle sudden capacity spikes. For the overview, see Gil Tene's React 2014 talk here:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MKY4KypBzg\n\nCoordinated omission starts at 42:57, but the whole thing is worth watching. The problem is that `wrk` \"synchronizes\" to Iron and doesn't issue new requests while the first ones are completing. In turn, this means that you only see a single request which is \"in flight\", and you are not measuring that other requests can't complete were they issued in the meantime. Tene's `wrk2` issues new requests at a steady rate, so it doesn't wait until the first request is completing before trying to issue the next one. Clearly something is amiss here, since Iron acts in a way that is completely different from other known web frameworks. But I only have a hypothesis at best. \n\nI find the test interesting and easily reproducible. As it stands, I'm interested in what can be done to tune Rust so it doesn't \"fail\" the test. My guess is I may need to tune the number of sockets which accept new connections, or bump the thread count upwards. The kernel is configured with a net.core.somaxconn setting of 64k so there should be ample buffering available in the kernel for new connections, so this can't be it. Also, wrk2 only measures after 10 seconds, so there is a warmup period before the system starts actual measurements.\n\nOther systems required some hand-tuning in order not to hit an artificial bottleneck, so I'm interested in what you would tune in Rust/Iron to achieve parity with the other frameworks.\n\nFinally, the `Cargo.lock` file:\n\n```\n[root]\nname = \"helloworld\"\nversion =

a Debian server and I'm trying to run the release version of my [simple web application](https://github.com/freiguy1/schedule-gen-web) using nickel.rs, and after it's been running for as little as 30

I added a middleware to log every request, and that doesn't even get reached.  When I use `curl` on the server pointed to localhost, that acts the same way as the browsers.  They just spin indefinitely.\n\nThe worst problem is that I try the same code/same version of rust on a different Ubuntu server and it never hangs.\n\nAny idea how to remedy this problem?\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nickel-org/nickel.rs/issues/218/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nickel-org/nickel.rs/issues/218/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
