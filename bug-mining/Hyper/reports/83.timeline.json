would be nice if rust-openssl provided a hostname verification API.\n\nHostname verification is an issue intimately tied to a particular SSL/TLS stack. Some questions that must be resolved are:\n1. Should we verify CNs in addition to SANs?\n2. How are name constraints enforced?\n\nUnfortunately OpenSSL (aside from the unreleased \"1.1.0\" version) does not implement hostname verification at all.\n\nI have plans on working on an RFC 6125-compliant hostname verification library in Rust that implements the \"best practices\" for hostname verification generally adopted by both Chrome and Firefox:\n\nhttps://github.com/tarcieri/pkixnames\n\nI am trying to aim for a least common denominator API that multiple TLS libraries could share. Unfortunately, for secure hostname validation, it will require deep integration with rust-openssl too.\n\nThis is a general problem in multiple projects, including Servo:\n\nhttps://github.com/servo/servo/issues/4954\nhttps://github.com/hyperium/hyper/issues/472\n\nAnyway, I'm gonna start working on my hostname verification library. If you think it makes sense to have rust-openssl support, let me know and I can probably help :wink:\n\nAlternatives might be integrating with something like Mozilla PKIX, which will definitely be more mature (compared to, say, my current vaporware). However, I think it would be nice to use a Rust library instead of a C++ library if it were sufficiently

noticed that `Openssl::with_cert_and_key` [disables certificate verification](https://github.com/hyperium/hyper/blob/7c76fff3aaf0f0a300e76622acb56eaf1e2cb474/src/net.rs#L624), shown below for convenience:\n\n``` rust\npub fn with_cert_and_key<C, K>(cert: C, key: K) -> Result<Openssl, SslError>\nwhere C: AsRef<Path>, K: AsRef<Path> {\n    let mut ctx = try!(SslContext::new(SslMethod::Sslv23));\n    try!(ctx.set_cipher_list(\"DEFAULT\"));\n    try!(ctx.set_certificate_file(cert.as_ref(), X509FileType::PEM));\n    try!(ctx.set_private_key_file(key.as_ref(), X509FileType::PEM));\n    ctx.set_verify(SSL_VERIFY_NONE, None);\n    Ok(Openssl { context: Arc::new(ctx) })\n}\n```\n\nI'm guessing this is done because the expected use is for a server accepting connections from clients without client certificates. However, if someone uses this method for setting up a client to present a client certificate to a server, this will disable verification of the server's certificate.\n\nIs my understanding here correct? If so, I think there should be two separate methods depending on whether it's intended for client or server use. At the very least, the documentation for the current method should make it very clear that it's not safe to use on the client side when using client certificates.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hyperium/hyper/issues/752/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hyperium/hyper/issues/752/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"actor":{"login":"brson","id":147214,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0NzIxNA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/147214?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/brson","html_url":"https://github.com/brson","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brson/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brson/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brson/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brson/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brson/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brson/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brson/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brson/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brson/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-05-04T20:57:58Z","updated_at":"2016-05-04T20:57:58Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/servo/servo/issues/11016","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/servo/servo","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/servo/servo/issues/11016/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/servo/servo/issues/11016/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/servo/servo/issues/11016/events","html_url":"https://github.com/servo/servo/issues/11016","id":153113157,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWUxNTMxMTMxNTc=","number":11016,"title":"Servo
