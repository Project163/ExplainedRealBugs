#2703\r\n\r\nIn https://github.com/hyperium/hyper/pull/3375 we were strict about sending trailers per RFC 7230. In this PR, I have been much more accepting of trailers. Is this the behavior we want?\r\n\r\nSome questions:\r\n\r\n- If the client does not send `TE: trailers` but the server sends trailer headers, should trailers be parsed and passed along?\r\n- If the server does not include a `trailers: ...` header indicating which trailer headers are being returned, should trailers be parsed and passed along? I think this one is almost certainly \"yes\".\r\n- If the server includes trailers with invalid header names, such as `Content-Length: 5`, should that still be parsed and passed along?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hyperium/hyper/issues/3637/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hyperium/hyper/issues/3637/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":12791995648,"node_id":"CE_lADOAWaYQc4_HJJ7zwAAAAL6dl0A","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hyperium/hyper/issues/events/12791995648","actor":{"login":"seanmonstar","id":51479,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxNDc5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/51479?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar","html_url":"https://github.com/seanmonstar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2024-05-13T19:24:27Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":12791995719,"node_id":"REFE_lADOAWaYQc4_HJJ7zwAAAAL6dl1H","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hyperium/hyper/issues/events/12791995719","actor":{"login":"seanmonstar","id":51479,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxNDc5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/51479?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar","html_url":"https://github.com/seanmonstar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"ac84af6b32a5d37d9343013ace088aaae47587b6","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hyperium/hyper/commits/ac84af6b32a5d37d9343013ace088aaae47587b6","created_at":"2024-05-13T19:24:27Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
