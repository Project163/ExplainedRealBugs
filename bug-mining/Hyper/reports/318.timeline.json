I agree with you, @nox, we _can_ add a method to `ResponseFuture` on the Rust side, and make it work right. However, it'd be less easy to access in the exposed C API, and will take more time to get right. So:\r\n\r\n1. First, add support for a callback extension, which will be exposed in the C API. This is the least complicated to do on hyper's side, so we can do it quickly. Importantly, though, most of it can be reused or only slightly altered to support the next steps.\r\n2. Because of the current client design, which separates the `ResponseFuture` from the separate client dispatcher task running in the background, we'd need some to add some sort of channel where the receiver is inside `ResponseFuture`, and the sender is in a request extension. Instead of storing the sender directly, we can reuse the callback to simply store a closure sending on the sender side of the channel.\r\n3. Finally, the higher level `ResponseFuture` (returned by `hyper::Client`, not `hyper::client::conn`) would need to separate some of its stages into an internal enum, so that polling `ResponseFuture::poll_informational()` could advance the stages far enough that the task wouldn't be stuck since the dns/connect/write stage hadn't gotten far enough.\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nThe first step is my next work priority.","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hyperium/hyper/issues/comments/875814457/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"seanmonstar","id":51479,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxNDc5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/51479?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar","html_url":"https://github.com/seanmonstar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":4990673411,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50NDk5MDY3MzQxMQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hyperium/hyper/issues/events/4990673411","actor":{"login":"nox","id":123095,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMzA5NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/123095?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nox","html_url":"https://github.com/nox","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nox/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nox/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nox/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nox/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nox/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nox/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nox/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nox/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nox/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-07-07T18:03:13Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":4990673413,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDQ5OTA2NzM0MTM=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hyperium/hyper/issues/events/4990673413","actor":{"login":"nox","id":123095,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMzA5NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/123095?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nox","html_url":"https://github.com/nox","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nox/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nox/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nox/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nox/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nox/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nox/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nox/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nox/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nox/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-07-07T18:03:13Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"actor":{"login":"seanmonstar","id":51479,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxNDc5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/51479?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar","html_url":"https://github.com/seanmonstar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-07-08T18:35:05Z","updated_at":"2021-07-08T18:35:05Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hyperium/hyper/issues/2594","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hyperium/hyper","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hyperium/hyper/issues/2594/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hyperium/hyper/issues/2594/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hyperium/hyper/issues/2594/even

Describe the bug\r\n\r\nDepending on whether `Cargo.toml` > `tauri` > `features` contains `[\"api-all\"]` or `[\"api-all\", \"reqwest-client\"]`, the `http` API behaves inconsistently when receiving
