would be far more powerful of a client & server if it was based on traditional event-oriented I/O, single-threaded or multi-threaded.  You should look into https://github.com/carllerche/mio or a wrapper around libuv or something of that sort.\n\nAnother option is to split hyper up into multiple crates, and refactor the client & server to abstract the HTTP protocol handling (reading & writing requests/responses onto a Stream) so that someone can use the client and/or server logic on top of their own sockets/streams that are polled in an event loop.  Think, libcurl's multi interface + libuv's uv_poll_t.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hyperium/hyper/issues/395/reactions","total_count":11,"+1":11,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hyperium/hyper/issues/395/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":15706188035,"node_id":"REFE_lADOAWaYQc4Cgr-mzwAAAAOoKWkD","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hyperium/hyper/issues/events/15706188035","actor":{"login":"dicej","id":1243153,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNDMxNTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1243153?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dicej","html_url":"https://github.com/dicej","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dicej/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dicej/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dicej/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dicej/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dicej/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dicej/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dicej/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dicej/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dicej/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"dfaccceb9e571c59b9ed18b607ea63e15129be8c","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dicej/hyper/commits/dfaccceb9e571c59b9ed18b607ea63e15129be8c","created_at":"2024-12-18T16:40:13Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":15706238105,"node_id":"REFE_lADOAWaYQc4Cgr-mzwAAAAOoKiyZ","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hyperium/hyper/issues/events/15706238105","actor":{"login":"dicej","id":1243153,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNDMxNTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1243153?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dicej","html_url":"https://github.com/dicej","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dicej/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dicej/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dicej/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dicej/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dicej/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dicej/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dicej/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dicej/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dicej/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"e06150e856cde3e3dd5352ccd2ee5ee0fe18f4ff","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dicej/hyper/commits/e06150e856cde3e3dd5352ccd2ee5ee0fe18f4ff","created_at":"2024-12-18T16:44:19Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
