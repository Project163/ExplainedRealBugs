When this is not the case however, custom code, which is invoked based on the `Status` of the `Response`, will be executed to (potentially) set a `Body`.\r\n\r\nFor example adding JSON to the `Body` with error details which have resulted from processing an invalid Request within a RESTful API so you don't need to replicate error handling/population code in multiple locations.\r\n\r\nHopefully that makes sense, little bit of weird one to explain, happy to provide a code example if that would
