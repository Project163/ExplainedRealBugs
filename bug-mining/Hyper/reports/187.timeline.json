My service supports client certificates, and I need information about them in the server, so I had to write some pretty gnarly integration code: https://github.com/alex/ct-tools/blob/master/src/main.rs#L345-L438\r\n\r\nThis relied on `hyper::server::Http::bind_connection`, which has been removed in the latest version of `hyper`.\r\n\r\nIs there a better way to connect hyper to my custom rustls server? As far as I can tell, there's no way to get the client certificate from a hyper request, so I still need the custom connector code.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hyperium/hyper/issues/1689/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hyperium/hyper/issues/1689/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":1941582925,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDE5NDE1ODI5MjU=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hyperium/hyper/issues/events/1941582925","actor":{"login":"seanmonstar","id":51479,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxNDc5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/51479?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar","html_url":"https://github.com/seanmonstar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"40f701b492cf60f89aec958239e82ebb1f18d00f","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hyperium/hyper/commits/40f701b492cf60f89aec958239e82ebb1f18d00f","created_at":"2018-11-01T21:02:53Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"actor":{"login":"seanmonstar","id":51479,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxNDc5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/51479?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar","html_url":"https://github.com/seanmonstar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-11-01T21:04:00Z","updated_at":"2018-11-01T21:04:00Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hyperium/hyper/issues/1692","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hyperium/hyper","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hyperium/hyper/issues/1692/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hyperium/hyper/issues/1692/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hyperium/hyper/issues/1692/events","html_url":"https://github.com/hyperium/hyper/pull/1692","id":376570132,"node_id":"MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0MjI3NzU5MTE4","number":1692,"title":"Change

The\r\n`MakeService` trait allows receiving an argument when creating a\r\n`Service`.
