For example, it sets the DEFAULT cipher list.  It also sets SSL_VERIFY_NONE.\nThis is called by `Server::listen_threads()`.   I'm trying to make changes that allow the caller to pass in an SslContext.\n\nCurrently the SSL configuration is declared when the Server is created, by passing a certificate and a key to `Server::https()`.  Unfortunately this scheme will not direclty work with a passed in `SslContext`, because if an `SslContext` is setup in the `Server` struct, it _moves_ when passed on to HttpListener::https(), causing a \"use of partially moved value\" error.   This cannot be solved via `clone()` because `SslContext` does not implement `clone()`.\n\nIf `Server::listen_threads()` accepted the SSL information at that point (rather than owning it in it's struct), this would cause a lot of breaking changes.\n\nOTOH, If `HttpListener` kept a reference to an `SslContext` (instead of owning it), it would propagate another annoying lifetime parameter over a lot of code.\n\nI don't see a clearly preferable way of implementing this. Given a preferred direction, I'd be happy to make the changes necessary. \n","closed_by":{"login":"seanmonstar","id":51479,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxNDc5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/51479?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar","html_url":"https://github.com/seanmonstar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hyperium/hyper/issues/471/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hyperium/hyper/issues/471/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
