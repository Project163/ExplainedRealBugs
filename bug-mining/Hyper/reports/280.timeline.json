hyper::client::conn::http1::handshake(Io).await.unwrap();\r\n    let request = hyper::Request::builder().body(\"\".to_string()).unwrap();\r\n    let response =

panics\r\n    let _ = futures_util::poll!(&mut response);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nMy fork has a runnable example at https://github.com/e00E/hyper/blob/panic-example/examples/panic.rs using an always pending IO implementation. Note that this branch also changes Cargo.toml. The panic can also be observed with real IO like tokio::TcpStream. I observed this panic in real code using reqwest and researched this issue afterwards.\r\n\r\nOn master the panic message is\r\n> thread 'main' panicked at 'dispatch dropped without returning error', /home/e/temp/hyper/src/client/conn/http1.rs:200:39\r\n\r\nOn 0.14. the panic message is\r\n> thread 'main' panicked at 'dispatch dropped without returning error', src/client/conn.rs:1023:39\r\n\r\nThe panicking code assumes that a channel is never dropped before a value is sent. However if `proto::h1::dispatch::Client` is dropped at the right moment this condition is violated. The problem is in `src/proto/h1/dispatch.rs` around line 580 (master and 0.14.x) `this.callback = Some(cb);`. The Callback is removed from the Envelope and stored in Client. If Client is then dropped the Callback and the contained Sender are dropped without sending a value.\r\n\r\nI made a PR to master with a fix. https://github.com/hyperium/hyper/pull/3031 . The same fix also works on 0.14.x . We can discuss the master PR first and when it is good I can backport the change.\r\nI am not very familiar with the hyper internals so there might be a better solution. I wasn't sure if the PRs should contain a test case and where it should reside, and whether the commit messages should include a full description of the issue.\r\n\r\nI am unsure if http2 is affected. On master I see that we spawn a task on the executor that calls the callback. This seems problematic too because when the executor shuts down it will drop the task.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hyperium/hyper/issues/3030/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hyperium/hyper/issues/3030/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":7694010475,"node_id":"REFE_lADOAWaYQc47ewfUzwAAAAHKmUhr","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hyperium/hyper/issues/events/7694010475","actor":{"login":"seanmonstar","id":51479,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxNDc5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/51479?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar","html_url":"https://github.com/seanmonstar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"9fa363829ced232acb18c31ebab8ffb93f691ecc","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hyperium/hyper/commits/9fa363829ced232acb18c31ebab8ffb93f691ecc","created_at":"2022-10-28T18:57:26Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":7694047656,"node_id":"REFE_lADOAWaYQc47ewfUzwAAAAHKmdmo","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hyperium/hyper/issues/events/7694047656","actor":{"login":"seanmonstar","id":51479,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxNDc5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/51479?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar","html_url":"https://github.com/seanmonstar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"a185f0f256bb1ba7ff6baa4c7e3de268ac351f46","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hyperium/hyper/commits/a185f0f256bb1ba7ff6baa4c7e3de268ac351f46","created_at":"2022-10-28T19:03:54Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":7694244686,"node_id":"REFE_lADOAWaYQc47ewfUzwAAAAHKnNtO","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hyperium/hyper/issues/events/7694244686","actor":{"login":"seanmonstar","id":51479,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxNDc5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/51479?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar","html_url":"https://github.com/seanmonstar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"d508ba9159a194550812158471bc4d04bf8161a9","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hyperium/hyper/commits/d508ba9159a194550812158471bc4d04bf8161a9","created_at":"2022-10-28T19:35:26Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":7694310397,"node_id":"REFE_lADOAWaYQc47ewfUzwAAAAHKndv9","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hyperium/hyper/issues/events/7694310397","actor":{"login":"seanmonstar","id":51479,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxNDc5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/51479?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar","html_url":"https://github.com/seanmonstar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https:/
