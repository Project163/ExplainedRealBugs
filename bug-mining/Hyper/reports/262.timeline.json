should probably write up some thoughts as to why this is currently the way it is.\r\n\r\nWrapping an error (so that there's an inner source) frequently provides more context that is useful to users. Without showing the source, the extra context can lose some of its meaning. For example, seeing just \"error trying to connect\" is also too vague, just as \"Connection refused\" can be. Most users of hyper tend to just log the `Display` output of the error, without anything fancy. So the format for hyper is to default to be most useful to them.\r\n\r\nI recognize that makes it more verbose for people using utilities to crawl the source chain. I currently chose to cater to the more common case.\r\n\r\nI'm also aware that the \"error working group\" currently recommends against doing what hyper does. But I don't agree, since it means hurting the common case. And since I believe most users will generally just default to logging `{}` of an error, I don't think \"more education\" will fix that. Thus, I'd suggest that the WG consider instead that errors print their source chain by default, and allow advance users to opt-in to custom formatting.

That way users can create a newtype around `hyper::Error` and use this in the `Display` impl to work around https://github.com/hyperium/hyper/issues/2732.\r\n\r\nFixes https://github.com/hyperium/hyper/issues/2732","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hyperium/hyper/issues/2737/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hyperium/hyper/issues/2737/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":6012752213,"node_id":"CE_lADOAWaYQc5BXdtPzwAAAAFmY1FV","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hyperium/hyper/issues/events/6012752213","actor":{"login":"seanmonstar","id":51479,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxNDc5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/51479?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar","html_url":"https://github.com/seanmonstar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-02-05T01:10:00Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":6012752295,"node_id":"REFE_lADOAWaYQc5BXdtPzwAAAAFmY1Gn","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hyperium/hyper/issues/events/6012752295","actor":{"login":"seanmonstar","id":51479,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxNDc5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/51479?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar","html_url":"https://github.com/seanmonstar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"6932896a7fca58fe461269461f925da8fd4e8d8a","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hyperium/hyper/commits/6932896a7fca58fe461269461f925da8fd4e8d8a","created_at":"2022-02-05T01:10:04Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hyperium/hyper/issues/comments/1036009768","html_url":"https://github.com/hyperium/hyper/issues/2732#issuecomment-1036009768","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hyperium/hyper/issues/2732","id":1036009768,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAWaYQc49wEEo","user":{"login":"davidpdrsn","id":718941,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcxODk0MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/718941?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidpdrsn","html_url":"https://github.com/davidpdrsn","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidpdrsn/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidpdrsn/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidpdrsn/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidpdrsn/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidpdrsn/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidpdrsn/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidpdrsn/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidpdrsn/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidpdrsn/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-02-11T09:18:59Z","updated_at":"2022-02-11T09:18:59Z","body":"To others who might find this.

v0.14.17\r\n\r\n**Description**\r\n`hyper::Error`'s `Display` impl will print its immediate cause in a `\"{description}: {cause}\"` format. The problem is this screws with anything else that tries to print an error along with its causes, as the immediate cause is also the returned value from `.source()`.\r\n\r\nFor example, if I were to print an error with `tracing`'s built-in support, e.g. `error!(err as &dyn StdError, \"message\")`, the resulting log line includes `err=error trying to connect: tcp connect error: Connection refused (os error 61) err.sources=[tcp connect error: Connection refused (os error 61), Connection refused (os error 61)]`. Or if I wrap this in an `eyre::Report` and print that with `{:#}` (which includes the cause chain), I get `error trying to connect: tcp connect error: Connection refused (os error 61): tcp connect error: Connection refused (os error 61): Connection refused (os error 61)` which is even more confusing.\r\n\r\nThis appears to be an intentional decision, especially as it has a `.message()` accessor that returns an `impl Display` that is just the message. But it's one that is very frustrating. Ideally `hyper::Error` would just not include its cause, relying on the user to opt in to showing causes. Alternatively it could just skip the first cause in the `.source()` accessor, though that means users who want to actually inspect that cause (e.g. to downcast it) can't (though in the case of the quoted error, its cause is not a public type and so there's nothing I can reasonably do with it besides just printing it).\r\n\r\nChanging this behavior will surprise anyone who is currently working around it, though I suspect it will simply produce better behavior for most users who just log the error and move on. My preferred solution of \"just don't print the cause\" does make the `message()` accessor pointless, though that could simply be deprecated without having to do a breaking change.\r\n\r\nIf you really don't want to make this change, then _at least_ please change the `message()` accessor to actually be an `impl StdError + Send + Sync` such that I can then pass _that_ to whatever I'm using that logs causes. The resulting error from this would of course retain the initial cause as the `source()`. Please also do this even if you decide the right solution is to just skip the initial cause in `source()`, so I can still get the formatting I want without having to reinvent error chains (especially when dealing with stuff like `eyre::Report`'s `{:?}` printing).","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hyperium/hyper/issues/2771/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hyperium/hyper/issues/2771/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"actor":{"login":"seanmonstar","id":51479,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxNDc5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/51479?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar","html_url":"https://github.com/seanmonstar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-03-26T17:34:38Z","updated_at":"2024-03-26T17:34:38Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/seanmonstar/reqwest/issues/2210","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/seanmonstar/reqwest","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/seanmonstar/reqwest/issues/2210/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/seanmonstar/reqwest/issues/2210/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/seanmonstar/reqwest/issues/2210/events","html_url":"https://github.com/seanmonstar/reqwest/issues/2210","id":2208819940,"node_id":"I_kwDOA7dkLM6Dp-rk","number":2210,"title":"reqwest::Error

updated version `to_string()` trait method of `reqwest::Error` is now not the informative when in case when there is a connection error. It is always only `error sending request` now. \r\nBefore it was something like `error sending request: operation timed out`, \r\n`error sending request: connection closed before message completed`, `error sending request: connection error: Connection reset by peer (os error 104)` etc. \r\nNow it is much harder to investigate what is causing the issues.
