I forgot to add BREAKING CHANGE warnings to the commits. The current behaviour is the intended behaviour.\n\nIt is impossible (I think so) to add optional parts to a macro without duplicating the definition, since every header should have tests this is no problem for the core of hyper. I think also external headers should have tests, they have been proven useful to discover bugs in header parsing and formatting inside hyper. Using the `test_header!` macro makes it really easy to test headers but it requires to be inside the `header!` macro. #489 will allow external code to use it in tests, but you can also write your own test functions inside the `header!` macro test section.\n","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hyperium/hyper/issues/comments/97862572/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"pyfisch","id":2781017,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3ODEwMTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2781017?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pyfisch","html_url":"https://github.com/pyfisch","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pyfisch/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pyfisch/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pyfisch/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pyfisch/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pyfisch/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pyfisch/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pyfisch/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pyfisch/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pyfisch/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hyperium/hyper/issues/comments/97864092","html_url":"https://github.com/hyperium/hyper/issues/490#issuecomment-97864092","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hyperium/hyper/issues/490","id":97864092,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDk3ODY0MDky","user":{"login":"seanmonstar","id":51479,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxNDc5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/51479?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar","html_url":"https://github.com/seanmonstar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-04-30T16:17:40Z","updated_at":"2015-04-30T16:17:40Z","body":"@pyfisch
