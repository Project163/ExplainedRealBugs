would like to propose the idea of inverting the way error reporters generally work in Rust. Instead of a reporter iterating all causes of an error to format them, pass in format rules to the top-level error.\r\n\r\nThe problems I'm trying to solve are:\r\n\r\n- Default behavior should be most useful for people who don't know it could be _more_ informative.\r\n- Errors that don't expose their source don't know what context they are being formatted in.\r\n\r\n## Problems\r\n\r\n### Default to most common case\r\n\r\nI posit that the most common case that _users_ print errors is for log purposes. I'll use an example of code I've seen over and over:\r\n\r\n```rust\r\ntask::spawn(async move {\r\n    if let Err(e) = do_it_better().await {\r\n        warn!(\"did it worse: {}\", e);\r\n    }\r\n})\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe current best practices hopes to educate users who have done this to either change the error type they've been returning at this top-ish level tasks, or to remember to wrap the error in a reporter right before printing it.\r\n\r\nI suggest that, instead of relying on education, the best practice simply assumes most users won't know about reporters. This change makes it so the common case simply prints all of the error chain to their logs. Specifically, separated by a `: `, not with newlines.\r\n\r\nOnce a user is educated about reporters, they can opt-in to customizing further, such as choosing newlines over colons, or how many down the stack to go, or whatever. When opted into a reporter, the reporter can then tell the `Display` of the error \"I only want the top error plz\".\r\n\r\nAs prior art, Go's simple way to [wrap an error][go-1] includes displaying it together on the same line, while also being available from `errors.Unwrap`.\r\n\r\n[go-1]: https://pkg.go.dev/errors#example-Unwrap\r\n\r\n### Opaque errors don't know their context\r\n\r\nSome libraries may wish to wrap errors in an [opaque way][errors-opaque], such that they don't expose the source so that users don't depend on a specific error. This is common in other languages, when it's preferred to not couple the internal details to the error, while still wanting to be to share the error _messages_ to help debugging. hyper is one library [with that desire][hyper-opaque].\r\n\r\nSince these opaque errors don't include the wrapped error in `source`, the current reporters cannot access them. But since no context is provided to `Display`, the opaque error cannot try to mimic the output of the rest of the stack.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Solution\r\n\r\nThe format traits already include a way to inject some context: the `std::fmt::Formatter`. That's how a type can check `f.alternate()` or `f.fill()`. Some of those are unused by structs, which we could overload. Or, we could define new ones.\r\n\r\nI outlined overloading some existing format flags [a few years ago][proposal]. My opinion about some details has changed since then, mostly that I believe the default should be to print everything in a single-line friendly mode, since as I described above, that's what I think the most common case is.\r\n\r\nI appreciate that the proposal allows specifying how deep down the stack to print. It also uses `f.alternate()` to determine if it should fit on one line, or use newlines and a stack trace. If we created new flags, we could inject a mode or even \"separator\" characters, similar to `f.fill()`. However, the exact details are a bit of a bikeshed, and **what I want most** is simply to have the idea of inverting the reporters to be considered.\r\n\r\n[default]:
