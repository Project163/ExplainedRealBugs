It really helps me to understand what the end goal is. In this case, it seems like a fine feature for an advanced configuration to allow binding to a local address before connecting to a remote. Some jumbled thoughts:\r\n\r\n- I'd probably suggest that it should be an option when configuring an `HttpConnector`, and not the `Client` directly, since it doesn't make sense in a generic fashion.\r\n- It seems we can use [`TcpStream::connect_std`](https://docs.rs/tokio/0.1.*/tokio/net/struct.TcpStream.html#method.connect_std), which doesn't return a boxed future. So, there shouldn't be need to make changes to mio and tokio, right?","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hyperium/hyper/issues/comments/384116444/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"seanmonstar","id":51479,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxNDc5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/51479?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar","html_url":"https://github.com/seanmonstar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hyperium/hyper/issues/comments/384344834","html_url":"https://github.com/hyperium/hyper/issues/1498#issuecomment-384344834","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hyperium/hyper/issues/1498","id":384344834,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM4NDM0NDgzNA==","user":{"login":"kw217","id":587036,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU4NzAzNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/587036?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kw217","html_url":"https://github.com/kw217","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kw217/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kw217/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kw217/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kw217/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kw217/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kw217/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kw217/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kw217/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kw217/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-04-25T16:14:33Z","updated_at":"2018-04-25T16:14:33Z","body":"Thanks @seanmonstar. Yes, making it an option on the connector makes lots of sense, so it looks like this:\r\n```rust\r\nlet bind_addr: Option<IpAddr> = Some(\"127.0.0.1\".parse().unwrap());\r\nlet mut connector = HttpConnector::new(4);\r\nconnector.set_local_address(bind_addr);\r\nlet client = Client::builder().build(connector);\r\n```\r\n\r\nAha, I see now that you've upgraded away from `tokio-core` (I was looking at the latest 0.11 release, not master). It looks a bit simpler now, and I see the Windows knowledge is already in Hyper so the need for it is no longer a concern. Thanks!\r\n\r\nHowever there is one remaining problem - where previously I had to allocate, now I think there's a case that isn't expressible at all. [`hyper::client::http::connect()`](https://github.com/hyperium/hyper/blob/f44fa0e64e6641c58a5d9608d07669a1bb732212/src/client/connect.rs#L149) takes an `Option<Handle>`, and I can extend it to also take a `local_address: Option<IpAddr>`. If the handle is present, I can bind to the local address before calling `TcpStream::connect_std`. But if the handle is absent, the only method I can call is `TcpStream::connect` - and that doesn't provide any way to bind first. Am I safe to call just `Handle::current()` here and call `TcpStream::connect_std` anyway, or is something missing from tokio?","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hyperium/hyper/issues/comments/384344834/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"kw217","id":587036,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU4NzAzNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/587036?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kw217","html_url":"https://github.com/kw217","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kw217/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kw217/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kw217/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kw217/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kw217/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kw217/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kw217/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kw217/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kw217/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":1594494347,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MTU5NDQ5NDM0Nw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hyperium/hyper/issues/events/1594494347","actor":{"login":"seanmonstar","id":51479,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxNDc5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/51479?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar","html_url":"https://github.com/seanmonstar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-04-25T16:14:33Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":1594494348,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDE1OTQ0OTQzNDg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hyperium/hyper/issues/events/1594494348","actor":{"login":"seanmonstar","id":51479,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxNDc5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/51479?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar","html_url":"https://github.com/seanmonstar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-04-25T16:14:33Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hyperium/hyper/issues/comments/384393286","html_url":"https://github.com/hyperium/hyper/issues/1498#issuecomment-384393286","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hyperium/hyper/issues/1498","id":384393286,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM4NDM5MzI4Ng==","user":{"login":"seanmonstar","id":51479,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxNDc5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/51479?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar","html_url":"https://github.com/seanmonstar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-04-25T18:44:34Z","updated_at":"2018-04-25T18:4
