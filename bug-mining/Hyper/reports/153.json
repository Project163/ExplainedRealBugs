So, on to the proposal:\r\n\r\n------\r\n\r\nI hinted at a possible solution [earlier in another issue](https://github.com/hyperium/hyper/issues/1075#issuecomment-297192417), and I think a solution is probably similar: Add a way to combine an `Http`, `Service`, `TcpListener`, and `Handle` into a `impl Future`. \r\n\r\n## Proposed API\r\n\r\n- `Http`\r\n  - `pub fn bind_handle<S>(&self, addr: &SocketAddr, new_service: S, handle: &Handle) -> Server`\r\n- `Server`\r\n  - `pub fn shutdown_signal<F>(&mut self, signal: F) -> &mut Self`\r\n  - `impl Future for Server`\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\n\r\n```rust\r\n// Spawn 2 servers on the same Core\r\nlet mut core = Core::new()?;\r\nlet handle = core.handle();\r\n\r\nlet srv1 = Http::new()\r\n    .bind_handle(addr1, new_service1, &handle);\r\n\r\nlet srv2 = Http::new()\r\n    .bind_handle(addr2, new_service2, &handle);\r\n\r\nhandle.spawn(srv1);\r\nhandle.spawn(srv2);\r\ncore.run(futures::future::empty())?;\r\n```\r\n\r\n```rust\r\n// Spawn a Server with a Client\r\nlet mut core = Core::new()?;\r\nlet handle = core.handle();\r\n\r\nlet client = Client::new(&handle);\r\nlet server = Http::new()\r\n    .bind_handle(addr, new_service(client), &handle);\r\nhandle.spawn(server);\r\n\r\ncore.run(futures::future::empty())?;\r\n```\r\n\r\n```rust\r\n// Spawn a Server and still get graceful shutdown\r\nlet mut core = Core::new()?;\r\nlet handle = core.handle();\r\n\r\n// send on tx to shutdown server future\r\nlet (tx, rx) = oneshot::channel();\r\n\r\nlet client = Client::new(&handle);\r\nlet mut server = Http::new()\r\n    .bind_handle(addr, new_service(client), &handle);\r\nserver.shutdown_signal(rx);\r\n\r\n// can even just run server directly\r\ncore.run(server)?;\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Implementation\r\n\r\nThis proposal is reusing the `Server` type, which already exists in a form that owns a `Core`. Internally, it can just change its field to an enum of 2 variants, 1 with a `Core`, and the other with a `Handle`. It should be able to use the majority of the same code in both cases.\r\n\r\nIt might be tricky that you can create a `Server` using `Http::bind`, which **owns a Core**, and then you can send that `Server` into another `Core`, calling `handle.spawn(server)`. If you were to do that, the `impl Future for Server` could make the outer `Core` lock up, since an implementation might decide to call `core.run()` on its inner `Core`.\r\n\r\nTo prevent that mistake, the `impl Future for Server` should probably panic if the `Server` owns a `Core`, and not a `Handle`, with a nice message explaining don't do that.\r\n\r\n/cc #1075 #1263 \r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"seanmonstar","id":51479,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxNDc5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/51479?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar","html_url":"https://github.com/seanmonstar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hyperium/hyper/issues/1322/reactions","total_count":13,"+1":11,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":2,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hyperium/hyper/issues/1322/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
