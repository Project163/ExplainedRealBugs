There may be cases where a user has several non-contiguous slices they would like to send. The `Buf` trait makes it possible to represent those as a single chunk, without having to copy to a single contiguous array. Additionally, `AsyncWrite::write_buf` can use that knowledge to call `writev`.\r\n\r\nCurrently, in that situation, a user must either copy all the data into 1 buffer before sending to hyper, or send multiple chunks. hyper *will* by default not merge the chunks, and try to use `writev` itself, so users can already benefit. However, that benefit may not be obvious. I'm wondering if allowing the chunk to be a `Buf` itself would be more obvious.\r\n\r\nSome potential downsides: it's a little more complicated to implement a custom `Buf` than a `AsRef<[u8]>`, though the common types already do. Additionally, it ties API compatibility to the `Buf` trait, which is expect to have some breaking changes. However, hyper already publicly exposes a dependency on `Bytes` from the same crate, and `AsyncWrite` which also depends on `Buf`, so probably not a big deal.\r\n\r\n/cc @scottlamb","closed_by":{"login":"seanmonstar","id":51479,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxNDc5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/51479?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar","html_url":"https://github.com/seanmonstar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hyperium/hyper/issues/1508/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hyperium/hyper/issues/1508/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
