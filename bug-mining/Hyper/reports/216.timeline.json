there currently a good way to send an `AsyncRead` as the body of a response (or a request for that matter)?\r\n\r\nThe best I could come up with is this:\r\n\r\n```\r\n    let stream = FramedRead::new(file, BytesCodec::new()).map(|r| {\r\n        r.map(|b| b.freeze())\r\n    });\r\n    Ok(Response::new(Body::wrap_stream(stream)))\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut there are a couple problems with this:\r\n1. It requires enabling the \"unstable-stream\" feature. The name make it sound like it is more unstable than the rest of the crate, but afaict, streams are stable in the upstream tokio and futures crates.\r\n2. Having to map over the Stream to convert the `Result<BytesMut, _>` to `Result<Bytes, _>` is unergonomic, especially since this pattern needs to be done each time an `AsyncRead` is sent as a `Body` (unless a custom `Decoder` is written to decode to `Chunk`s or something).\r\n\r\nFor 1, I think that either the feature flag should be removed, or there should be better documentation on why it exists.\r\n\r\nFor 2, the easiest solutions would be to either implement `From<BytesMut>` for `Chunk`, or do #1931. Another option is to add direct support for `AsyncRead` to `Body` (See #1328).\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hyperium/hyper/issues/2008/reactions","total_count":7,"+1":4,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":3},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hyperium/hyper/issues/2008/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hyperium/hyper/issues/comments/561862247","html_url":"https://github.com/hyperium/hyper/issues/2034#issuecomment-561862247","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hyperium/hyper/issues/2034","id":561862247,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU2MTg2MjI0Nw==","user":{"login":"hwchen","id":3781771,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3ODE3NzE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3781771?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hwchen","html_url":"https://github.com/hwchen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hwchen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hwchen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hwchen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hwchen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hwchen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hwchen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hwchen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hwchen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hwchen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-12-04T22:10:20Z","updated_at":"2019-12-04T22:10:49Z","body":"To me, `Stream` seemed like a core trait, just like `Future`, so I was surprised when I had to switch it on in hyper.\r\n\r\nI know that the reality around what’s core at the moment is a bit more complicated at the moment, but the above is just my initial reaction.\r\n\r\nI would vote yes for `stream` as default,  but perhaps there’s downsides I didn’t think of.","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hyperium/hyper/issues/comments/561862247/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"hwchen","id":3781771,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3ODE3NzE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3781771?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hwchen","html_url":"https://github.com/hwchen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hwchen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hwchen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hwchen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hwchen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hwchen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hwchen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hwchen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hwchen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hwchen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hyperium/hyper/issues/comments/561864727","html_url":"https://github.com/hyperium/hyper/issues/2034#issuecomment-561864727","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hyperium/hyper/issues/2034","id":561864727,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU2MTg2NDcyNw==","user":{"login":"davidbarsky","id":2067774,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwNjc3NzQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2067774?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidbarsky","html_url":"https://github.com/davidbarsky","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidbarsky/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidbarsky/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidbarsky/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidbarsky/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidbarsky/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidbarsky/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidbarsky/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidbarsky/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidbarsky/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-12-04T22:17:19Z","updated_at":"2019-12-04T22:17:19Z","body":"I think it should be.
