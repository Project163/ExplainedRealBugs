the \"E-easy\" fix?\r\n\r\nI thought it might be just as simple as replacing the `#[cfg(feature = \"tcp\")] pub use ...;` with `cfg_feature! { #![feature = \"tcp\"] pub use ...; }` so that the re-export has a `doc(cfg(...))`, but the docs page still has the banner with the original list of features, ie without `tcp`. I guess rustdoc only looks at `doc(cfg())`s on the definition, not a re-export, even when viewing the re-exported path.\r\n\r\nSo I tried replacing the `#[cfg(feature = \"tcp\")] mod tcp;` in `server/mod.rs` with `cfg_feature! { #![feature = \"tcp\"] mod tcp; }`. That still didn't change the banner on `AddrIncoming` itself, but it did add banners on every method and trait impl of `AddrIncoming` noting that they require the `tcp` feature. Ideally there'd be just the one banner on the type itself, that said \"This is supported on crate feature `server` and (crate features `http1` or `http2`) and `tcp` only\", but I guess this is better than nothing.\r\n\r\nIs there a better solution?\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nEdit: Actually, this is already the case for `hyper::server::Server` - it's re-exported from `server/mod.rs` inside a `cfg_feature! { any(http1, http2) }` block, but the type-level banner in its docs only mention the `server` feature. The `http1` and `http2` banners are on its individual methods and trait impls. So I assume this is fine for `AddrIncoming` too.","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hyperium/hyper/issues/comments/775654836/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"Arnavion","id":1096010,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwOTYwMTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1096010?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Arnavion","html_url":"https://github.com/Arnavion","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Arnavion/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Arnavion/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Arnavion/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Arnavion/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Arnavion/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Arnavion/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Arnavion/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Arnavion/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Arnavion/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"actor":{"login":"Arnavion","id":1096010,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwOTYwMTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1096010?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Arnavion","html_url":"https://github.com/Arnavion","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Arnavion/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Arnavion/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Arnavion/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Arnavion/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Arnavion/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Arnavion/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Arnavion/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Arnavion/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Arnavion/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-02-09T04:46:16Z","updated_at":"2021-02-09T04:46:16Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hyperium/hyper/issues/2430","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hyperium/hyper","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hyperium/hyper/issues/2430/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hyperium/hyper/issues/2430/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hyperium/hyper/issues/2430/events","html_url":"https://github.com/hyperium/hyper/pull/2430","id":804201215,"node_id":"MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0NTcwMDA4NzI4","number":2430,"title":"docs(server):
