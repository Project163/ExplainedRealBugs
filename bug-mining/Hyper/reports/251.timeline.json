Thanks for implementing this -- is it complete so I can give it a try?\r\n\r\nI kind of worked around this by issuing a lower-case \"connect\" request and passing around a streaming body for the \"connect\" request.  The streaming body is basically one end of the pipe (I used tokio's DuplexStream, but I just need a HalfDuplexStream).  The other end of this pipe, and the response's streaming body become a custom H2Upgraded struct that satisfies the trait bound `AsyncRead+AsyncWrite+Unpin+'static`, so I can use it anywhere to spawn servers or whatever.","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hyperium/hyper/issues/comments/832244096/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"jvimal","id":168882,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2ODg4Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/168882?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jvimal","html_url":"https://github.com/jvimal","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jvimal/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jvimal/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jvimal/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jvimal/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jvimal/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jvimal/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jvimal/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jvimal/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jvimal/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":4685666832,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50NDY4NTY2NjgzMg==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hyperium/hyper/issues/events/4685666832","actor":{"login":"nox","id":123095,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMzA5NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/123095?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nox","html_url":"https://github.com/nox","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nox/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nox/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nox/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nox/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nox/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nox/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nox/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nox/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nox/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-05-04T21:00:36Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
