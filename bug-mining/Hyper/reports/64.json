Through using openssl and making my own SSLContext I am already able to require the client to send a certificate and reject as the server seems appropriate. But within the SSL-verify callback I can't alter the context of request. So, in order to be able to not only have a yes-no but an actual \"this certificate belongs to that user\", I'd need support to access the ssl certificate/context from within the handler so the application code can decide based on that, but that seems impossible at the moment as they are encapsulated away.\n\nI can provide my code if anyone cares and if someone tells me, what changes would be accepted as a PR would also be willing to make the changes myself. Unless I have missed some way to make that happen.\n","closed_by":{"login":"seanmonstar","id":51479,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxNDc5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/51479?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar","html_url":"https://github.com/seanmonstar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hyperium/hyper/issues/627/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hyperium/hyper/issues/627/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
