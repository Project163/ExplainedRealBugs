To summarize the issue : the `fetch` specification has been recently updated to handle multiple values for the [`Content-Length` header](https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/#content-length-header). I found Hyper client does not handle the header as expected by the specification. To be more precise, hyper does not handle the multiple values into only one header entry : `Content-Length: 42,42`. I don't know if we want to update hyper to follow this specification or not.\r\n\r\nI reproduced the error with the [example client](https://github.com/hyperium/hyper/blob/master/examples/client.rs) and the following node http server code:\r\n```js\r\nvar http = require('http');\r\n\r\nhttp.createServer(function (req, res) {\r\n    res.writeHead(200, {'Content-Length': '42,42'});\r\n    res.write('012345678901234567890123456789012345678901');\r\n    res.end();\r\n}).listen(8080);\r\n```","closed_by":{"login":"seanmonstar","id":51479,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxNDc5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/51479?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar","html_url":"https://github.com/seanmonstar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hyperium/hyper/issues/2470/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hyperium/hyper/issues/2470/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
