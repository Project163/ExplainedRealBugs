Maybe instead of String it could take an [IpAddr](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/net/enum.IpAddr.html)?\r\n* Using a trait provided by another crate (like abstract-ns as discussed in #1174)\r\n    * This would be a good point, I could see some sort of `ToSocketAddrsFuture` trait that's implemented and shared amongst crates so there's no need for new types to bridge implementations. \r\n\r\nLet me know if I'm missing anything, or if you're worried about any other use-cases! The only thing I can see is possibly supporting a generic `ToSocketAddrsFuture` (or something) trait with other crates, which would include research into what crates are used, what should be on a generic trait, etc. It expands the scope from a trait for `HttpConnector` to a trait of any DNS resolver to plug into, which is quite a leap.\r\n\r\nAnyways I think an initial step is for me to duplicate the HttpConnector and add in DNS substitution. That way I can continue without being blocked and if supporting a larger scope is required it can be prototyped outside of Hyper without requiring releases for the crate as a whole. If no larger scope is required though, it would be good to get the trait bound merged in!\r\n\r\n","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hyperium/hyper/issues/comments/389597448/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"DarrenTsung","id":1581481,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODE0ODE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1581481?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/DarrenTsung","html_url":"https://github.com/DarrenTsung","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DarrenTsung/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DarrenTsung/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DarrenTsung/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DarrenTsung/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DarrenTsung/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DarrenTsung/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DarrenTsung/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DarrenTsung/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DarrenTsung/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hyperium/hyper/issues/comments/389600699","html_url":"https://github.com/hyperium/hyper/issues/1517#issuecomment-389600699","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hyperium/hyper/issues/1517","id":389600699,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM4OTYwMDY5OQ==","user":{"login":"seanmonstar","id":51479,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxNDc5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/51479?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar","html_url":"https://github.com/seanmonstar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-05-16T17:27:30Z","updated_at":"2018-05-16T17:27:30Z","body":"> Maybe instead of String it could take an IpAddr?\r\n\r\nIf we already had an `IpAddr`, we wouldn't need to do resolution, right? :D In fact, hyper does skip resolution if the hostname parses as an `IpAddr`.\r\n\r\nI think it'd be reasonable to try to include a `Resolve` trait specifically for `HttpConnector`.

I'll definitely keep an eye on tokio-dns, and would be happy to wait for it if that's the right solution.\r\n\r\n@seanmonstar: Ah, yeah oops, that would not be necessary :P.\r\n\r\nDoes `Connect` allow users to define any error? From the code it looks to have some sort of bound on `io:Error` like the proposed trait, although you could just create `io::Error` from your Error.\r\n\r\nAh, okay, I'm looking at the 0.11 branch, on `master` branch it does allow any error. Given that `HttpConnector` is an implementation of `Connect` and defines its error type as `io::Error` it would make sense to me to have the `Resolve` trait (bounded on `HttpConnector`) as `io::Error` as well.\r\n\r\nGood point with the port:\r\n* Looking at `trust-dns`, the implementation for [lookup_ip](https://docs.rs/trust-dns-resolver/0.8.2/trust_dns_resolver/struct.ResolverFuture.html#method.lookup_ip) does not take in a port and returns `IpAddr`s\r\n* `tokio-dns::Resolver`only operates on the host and returns `IpAddr`s as well. \r\n* [abstract_ns::Resolve](https://docs.rs/abstract-ns/0.4.3/abstract_ns/trait.Resolve.html) operates on only a string as well, it returns `SocketAddr`s though.\r\n\r\nGiven the API for these crates, I would lean towards avoiding passing in the port and have the future return `Iterator<Item=IpAddr>` and constructing the `SocketAddr`s

an update on this, I've created a duplicate of `hyper 0.11`'s `HttpConnector` and have swapped out the DNS resolver on a branch to use `trust-dns` and `c-ares` (after running into some internal `trust-dns` issues (https://github.com/bluejekyll/trust-dns/issues/470)).\r\n\r\nBoth implementations would match the latest proposed trait without any problems

How does the generic on `HttpConnector` play out in practice? Annoying? Ignorable?\r\n\r\nI've wanted to be able to change out the default resolver for trust-dns for a while, and besides wanting to wait for it to be as reliable as `getaddrinfo`, the other problem is some of the constructors for `HttpConnector` would break. This change could actually make the switch compatible.\r\n\r\nBasically, it could be similar to `HashMap` that has a default hasher that doesn't otherwise expose what it is, which allowed switching from SipHash-2-4 to 1-3. There could be a `DefaultResolver` newtype that hides its details, besides a GAI resolver type.\r\n\r\nI'll be of limited availability for the next week, but I'd welcome this change for the 0.12 release if someone would like to make a
