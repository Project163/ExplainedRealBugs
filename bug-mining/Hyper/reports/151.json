Would it be possible to change the name?\r\n\r\nThe reason I ask is: as I understand it, the HTTP RFCs use that term in a different way, and I think it'll be confusing. I care because I find the RFC meaning useful; in fact it's a central abstraction in a [crate](https://github.com/scottlamb/http-serve) I'm working on that takes care of handling conditional GETs, byte range serving, and such. I could find a different name for my trait but I think it'll be extra confusing to flip between the HTTP RFCs, my crate's thing, and hyper's docs.\r\n\r\nTo be precise, as I read the HTTP RFCs, an entity is something that has a tag (etag), some headers (entity-headers), and a body (entity-headers). (Maybe also trailers? Unsure.) This trait is just representing a request/response body (and trailers, with HTTP/2); that's only _part_ of the entity's body with range requests / `206 Partial Content`.\r\n\r\nI confess I don't have another suggestion for the name of this trait, though. You basically want the trait and the concrete type (currently `Body`) to have similar but not identical names, right? and not `Stream`, as that's taken by the futures concept? Naming is hard, let's go shopping...","closed_by":{"login":"seanmonstar","id":51479,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxNDc5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/51479?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar","html_url":"https://github.com/seanmonstar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hyperium/hyper/issues/1464/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hyperium/hyper/issues/1464/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
