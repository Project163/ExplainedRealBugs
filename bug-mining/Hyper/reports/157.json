In order to pass the context genereted within the `Service::call` to the task of lower layer, it is necessary to use the message passing using the channel as follows:\r\n\r\n```rust\r\n// A pair of mpsc channel to pass a value of context.\r\nlet (tx, rx) = futures::sync::mpsc::unbounded();\r\n\r\nlet service = service_fn(move |req| {\r\n     ...\r\n    // send the value of context to the following connection task\r\n    if some_condition(req) {\r\n        tx.unbounded_send(context);\r\n    }\r\n    Ok(response)\r\n});\r\nlet conn = protocol.serve_connection(io, service);\r\n\r\n// task to manage a TCP connection considering upgrade\r\nlet mut conn_opt = Some(conn);\r\nlet mut rx_opt = Some(rx);\r\nlet task = poll_fn(move || {\r\n    try_ready!(conn_opt.as_mut().unwrap().poll_without_shutdown());\r\n\r\n    let conn = conn.take().unwrap();\r\n    let Parts { io, read_buf, .. } = conn.into_parts();\r\n\r\n    // Try to retrieve the value of the context.\r\n    let mut rx = rx_opt.take().unwrap();\r\n    match rx.poll().unwrap() {\r\n        Ok(Async::Ready(Some(context))) => {\r\n            // migration to upgraded protocol\r\n        },\r\n        _ => {\r\n            // shutdown I/O\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\nUsing such a method complicates the connection between the `Service` layer and the lower connection task.  To avoid this, the modification of the upgrade API by adding additional field to the return value from `Connection::into_parts()` is required.\r\n\r\nMy suggestion is to add the value of `Service` used in HTTP as follows:\r\n\r\n```rust\r\n#[derive(Default)]\r\nstruct MyService {\r\n    // such internal mutability will become unnecessary\r\n    // by changing the receiver of Service::call to &mut self.\r\n    context: RefCell<Option<UpgradeContext>>,\r\n}\r\n\r\nimpl Service for MyService {\r\n    fn call(&self, req: Request) -> Self::Future {\r\n        // set the value of context\r\n        if some_condition(req) {\r\n            *context.borrow_mut() = Some(context);\r\n        }\r\n        Ok(response)\r\n    }\r\n}\r\nlet conn = protocol.serve_connection(io, MyService::default());\r\n\r\nlet mut conn_opt = Some(conn);\r\nlet task = poll_fn(move || {\r\n    try_ready!(conn_opt.as_mut().unwrap().poll_without_shutdown());\r\n\r\n    // There is no additional channel to receive the value of context.\r\n    let conn = conn.take().unwrap();\r\n    let Parts { io, read_buf, service, .. } = conn.into_parts();\r\n    match service.context {\r\n        Some(context) => {\r\n            // migration to upgraded protocol\r\n        },\r\n        _ => {\r\n            // shutdown I/O\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\nIs it possible to make such changes?","closed_by":{"login":"seanmonstar","id":51479,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxNDc5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/51479?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar","html_url":"https://github.com/seanmonstar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hyperium/hyper/issues/1471/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hyperium/hyper/issues/1471/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
