Seems there's two parts to this bug:\r\n\r\n- When the version is `HTTP/1.0`, and the response didn't send `Connection: keep-alive`, it should have closed the connection.\r\n- When coercing an `HTTP/1.1` response to `HTTP/1.0` because that's what the client speaks, a `Connection: keep-alive` header should be added.\r\n\r\nProbably the best place to do this is in [`Conn::enforce_version`](https://github.com/hyperium/hyper/blob/069a32b1acc5ece35643c26cf5d9972dace5481c/src/proto/h1/conn.rs#L449). If enforcing 1.0, then check for the response version. If also 1.0, then check for `Connection: keep-alive`, and it not present, call `self.state.disable_keep_alive()`. If the response is 1.1, then translating to 1.1 should add `Connection: keep-alive` if `self.state.wants_keep_alive()` is true.
