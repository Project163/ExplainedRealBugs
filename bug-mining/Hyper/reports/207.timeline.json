Routes that do not `await` anything can remain unchanged. `#[catch]`ers can also be defined as an `async fn`.\r\n  * Methods on `Data` now return `Future`s that must be `.await`ed. As a consequence, any route that uses `Data` directly must be `async`. Routes that use data guards such as `Json` are not affected by this change.\r\n  * Routes that make their own network requests or other I/O should be `async`, as it will allow other requests to continue while waiting for the operation.\r\n* Mid and low-level APIs (`FromTransformedData` and `FromData`, `Fairing`, `Responder`)\r\n  * Several traits are now defined using `async-trait`, re-exported as `#[rocket::async_trait]`.\r\n  * Data is read asynchronously: `DataStream` implements `tokio::io::AsyncRead` instead of `Read`. Thus, `FromTransformedData::transform` and `From(Transformed)Data::from_data` are `async fn` or return `Future`s.\r\n  * Response bodies are streamed to the client asynchronously: `set_body` and related methods expect `tokio::io::AsyncRead` instead of `Read`.\r\n    * Consequently, `Fairing::on_response` and `Responder::respond_to` are now `async fn`. This allows Responders and Fairings to access and/or replace the body data.\r\n* The testing APIs have been moved to `rocket::local::asynchronous` and `rocket::local::blocking`. The `blocking` test API is simpler to use, and recommended when possible.\r\n* `#[rocket::main]`, `#[rocket::launch]`, and `#[rocket::async_test]` have been added to make `async fn` easily accessible for `main()` and `test()`.\r\n* Many long-standing bugs with keep-alive, graceful shutdown (#180), performance, and more are fixed or will be easier to fix by using actively-supported versions of libraries.\r\n* Some new functionality will be possible to implement, such as SSE and WebSockets. These will likely not make it into Rocket 0.5. At this point, Rocket should not be missing any APIs necessary to implement SSE \"by hand\". WebSockets is a bit more complicated, and tracked in #90
