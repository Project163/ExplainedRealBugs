As a part of that, we sent a CONNECT request, with a body. \nThat resulted in the error: `hyper_util::client::legacy::Error(SendRequest, hyper::Error(Http2, Error { kind: Reason(INTERNAL_ERROR) })) }`\n\nIt can be reproduced with:\n\n```rust\nuse reqwest::Method;\nuse tracing::Level;\n\n#[tokio::main]\nasync fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error + Send + Sync>> {\n    tracing_subscriber::fmt()\n        .with_max_level(Level::TRACE)\n        .init();\n\n    let client = reqwest::Client::builder()\n        .http2_prior_knowledge()\n        .build()\n        .unwrap();\n\n    let res = client\n        .request(Method::CONNECT, \"https://nghttp2.org/httpbin/post\")\n        .body(\"example body\")\n        .send()\n        .await;\n    println!(\"{res:?}\");\n\n    Ok(())\n}\n```\n\nDoing a bit of investigation with the backtrace crate, I gathered that the error originates from [h2/client.rs](https://github.com/hyperium/hyper/blob/master/src/proto/h2/client.rs#L678). \n\nTwo weird things about that:\n1. We did not see the tracing warn message, so it was really hard to figure out what is going wrong. Not sure whether this is a configuration error on our side, but we see all the other tracing events from hyper.\n\nLog from example:\n```\n2025-03-20T08:53:10.774367Z DEBUG reqwest::connect: starting new connection: https://nghttp2.org/\n2025-03-20T08:53:10.775902Z DEBUG hyper_util::client::legacy::connect::http: connecting to [2400:8902::f03c:91ff:fe69:a454]:443\n2025-03-20T08:53:11.077096Z DEBUG hyper_util::client::legacy::connect::http: connecting to 139.162.123.134:443\n2025-03-20T08:53:11.344664Z DEBUG hyper_util::client::legacy::connect::http: connected to 139.162.123.134:443\n2025-03-20T08:53:11.702388Z DEBUG h2::client: binding client connection\n2025-03-20T08:53:11.702435Z DEBUG h2::client: client connection bound\n2025-03-20T08:53:11.702457Z DEBUG h2::codec::framed_write: send frame=Settings { flags: (0x0), enable_push: 0, initial_window_size: 2097152, max_frame_size: 16384, max_header_list_size: 16384 }\n2025-03-20T08:53:11.702595Z DEBUG hyper_util::client::legacy::pool: pooling idle connection for (\"https\", nghttp2.org)\n2025-03-20T08:53:11.702641Z  WARN hyper_util::client::legacy::client: HTTP/1.1 CONNECT request stripping path: /httpbin/post\nErr(reqwest::Error { kind: Request, url: \"https://nghttp2.org/httpbin/post\", source: hyper_util::client::legacy::Error(SendRequest, hyper::Error(Http2, Error { kind: Reason(INTERNAL_ERROR) })) })\n2025-03-20T08:53:11.702817Z DEBUG Connection{peer=Client}: h2::codec::framed_write: send frame=WindowUpdate { stream_id: StreamId(0), size_increment: 5177345 }\n```\n\n2. Somehow, this path is only triggered when using HTTP2 with TLS. Using HTTP2 without TLS does not trigger the error. I know that that is then rather on how reqwest is using hyper, but still, maybe there could be a better place to check on whether the body is empty?\n\nNot sure whether there is anything to fix / change here, we primarly wanted to report this.","closed_by":{"login":"seanmonstar","id":51479,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxNDc5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/51479?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar","html_url":"https://github.com/seanmonstar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hyperium/hyper/issues/3858/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":1},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hyperium/hyper/issues/3858/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
