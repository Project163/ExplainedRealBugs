But it's likely too late to fit into RC1.\r\n\r\nThe client code currently spawns a couple tasks for a connection, but does so by requiring the `Executor<Box<dyn Future + Send>>`, so we can spawn multiple. We can't make the internal type public, but we need to propagate the `Send` bounds of the IO and body types. So, we should change it to have bounds similar to the `server::conn::http2`, essentially an extension trait that means `E: Executor<InternalFutureType<IO, B>>`.\r\n\r\nA way we can tell this all works is that we should be able to augment the single-threaded example file with a client as well.\r\n\r\nOther relevant issues: #2341","closed_by":{"login":"seanmonstar","id":51479,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxNDc5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/51479?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar","html_url":"https://github.com/seanmonstar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hyperium/hyper/issues/3017/reactions","total_count":5,"+1":5,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hyperium/hyper/issues/3017/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
