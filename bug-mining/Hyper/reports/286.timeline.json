If we have users implement connectors via the connect trait and some via the service trait then then we create a split. If we use trait aliases then every implementation has to derived from `tower_service::Service` which allows a lot of flexibility and composability. At least that is how I see it. The `HttpService` idea comes from `tower_http` and connect comes from `tower_make::MakeConnection`.
