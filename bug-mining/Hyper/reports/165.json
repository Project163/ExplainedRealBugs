Unfortunately, since hyper's error type is now opaque (as of https://github.com/hyperium/hyper/commit/5d3c472228d40b57e47ea26004b3710cfdd451f3), I can no longer easily see if that was the cause of an error raised by `Server::try_bind`.\r\n\r\nWhile I *could* construct a `TcpListener` myself and then pass that listener's `Incoming` to `Server::builder`, that's an unfortunate amount of extra boilerplate. Perhaps it would make sense to expose an `as_io_error(&self) -> Option<&io::Error>` on `hyper::Error`?","closed_by":{"login":"seanmonstar","id":51479,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxNDc5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/51479?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar","html_url":"https://github.com/seanmonstar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hyperium/hyper/issues/1542/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hyperium/hyper/issues/1542/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
