certain cases I see Response future  is not dropped when the connection closes.

What happens is that if a worker restarts, it is left  registered but disconnected and it leads to next client request to hang. I added a small debugging class that tells me when the futures are dropped. It confirms that the response future from /next is not dropped on worker disconnect.\r\n\r\nChanging the workers to use HTTP/2 instead of HTTP/1.1 (un-comment https://github.com/luben/repro-hyper/blob/master/src/bin/worker.rs#L16) solves the issue.\r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hyperium/hyper/issues/1716/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hyperium/hyper/issues/1716/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":1988015240,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDE5ODgwMTUyNDA=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hyperium/hyper/issues/events/1988015240","actor":{"login":"luben","id":391130,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5MTEzMA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/391130?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/luben","html_url":"https://github.com/luben","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luben/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luben/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luben/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luben/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luben/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luben/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luben/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luben/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luben/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"7aae82ad6d806f86f9d542d5c324143edb8dec3c","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/luben/repro-hyper/commits/7aae82ad6d806f86f9d542d5c324143edb8dec3c","created_at":"2018-11-26T21:58:19Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":12498528307,"node_id":"REFE_lADOAWaYQc4WyJrezwAAAALo-Ggz","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hyperium/hyper/issues/events/12498528307","actor":{"login":"hjr3","id":33318,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzMzE4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/33318?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hjr3","html_url":"https://github.com/hjr3","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hjr3/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hjr3/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hjr3/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hjr3/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hjr3/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hjr3/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hjr3/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hjr3/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hjr3/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"e455fa2452cf45d66de6b4c3dc567e2b5d2368a4","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hjr3/hyper/commits/e455fa2452cf45d66de6b4c3dc567e2b5d2368a4","created_at":"2024-04-17T00:15:43Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
