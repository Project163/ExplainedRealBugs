There is a socket option to tell the OS \"Hey, it's really OK if I reuse the port right away\". You could try setting that option to see if that's the issue (it could also just be a bug in hyper or tokio).\r\n\r\nAnd... I just checked, and hyper's built-in listener builder doesn't have a way to set that option, but you could build a custom one (and if it works, we can add that method into hyper directly!):\r\n\r\n```rust\r\nextern crate net2;\r\nextern crate tokio;\r\n// hyper and stuff of course...\r\n\r\nuse tokio::net::TcpListener;\r\n\r\nfn listener() -> io::Result<TcpListener> {\r\n     // whatever addr\r\n    let addr = SocketAddr::from(([127, 0, 0, 1], 3030));\r\n    net2::TcpBuilder::new_v4()?\r\n        .reuse_address(true)?\r\n        .bind(&addr)?\r\n        .listen(1024).and_then(|listener| {\r\n            TcpListener::from_std(listener, &Default::default())\r\n        })\r\n}\r\n\r\n// making a server with a custom listener\r\nlet incoming = listener()?.incoming();\r\nlet opts = hyper::server::conn::Http::new();\r\nlet server = hyper::server::Builder::new(incoming, opts)\r\n  .serve(new_service);\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nPS, calling `Runtime::shutdown_now()` is an abortive shutdown.

I was aware of the existence of `SO_REUSEADDR`, but I wasn't sure whether it was relevant in this case. I would have expected identical behaviour from restarting the server within the process to just restarting the process, which as noted above is not what I see.\r\n\r\nI am using `shutdown_now` after doing all of the graceful shutdown I can for other tasks, because I cannot find another way of getting the `Server` future to complete gracefully. That is what I was hoping I might have missed in the docs, since they do mention that for `Server`, \"the future completes when the server has been shutdown\". The trouble is that I cannot find how to achieve that.\r\n\r\nAnyway, I tried using `reuse_address`, similarly to how you have described. The main differences are that I have handling for IPv6 addresses as well as IPv4, and I enable `nodelay` on the `TcpStream`s that the incoming stream puts out.\r\n\r\nWith this configuration the setup succeeds, however I find that I cannot connect to a server on a recreated socket. In other words, after running the server and then restarting it within the same process, it does not accept TCP connections. It also no longer accepts connections when bound on IPv6 addresses at all, even for the first creation of the socket.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion I'm not convinced that the problem that is normally solved by using `SO_REUSEADDR` is fully responsible here.\r\n\r\nThanks again for this great library, by the way.","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hyperium/hyper/issues/comments/399454933/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"dylanede","id":10339269,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMzM5MjY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10339269?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dylanede","html_url":"https://github.com/dylanede","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dylanede/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dylanede/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dylanede/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dylanede/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dylanede/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dylanede/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dylanede/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dylanede/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dylanede/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hyperium/hyper/issues/comments/399479833","html_url":"https://github.com/hyperium/hyper/issues/1575#issuecomment-399479833","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hyperium/hyper/issues/1575","id":399479833,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM5OTQ3OTgzMw==","user":{"login":"dylanede","id":10339269,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMzM5MjY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10339269?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dylanede","html_url":"https://github.com/dylanede","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dylanede/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dylanede/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dylanede/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dylanede/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dylanede/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dylanede/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dylanede/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dylanede/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dylanede/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-06-22T15:25:34Z","updated_at":"2018-06-22T15:25:34Z","body":"I see now that shutting down the server is a case of making the incoming stream end.

adds a simple graceful shutdown ability to the server. It's a \"combinator\" on `hyper::Server`, and takes a generic user-supplied future to \"select\" on. Notably, if people aren't using this, they aren't paying the book-keeping cost at all.\r\n\r\n- If the server incoming stream finishes (like `TcpListener::incoming()`, or any other), what should happen? Should that be another way that starts the graceful shutdown? Or is that more a sign of something more urgent happening?\r\n  - Answer: this will just return immediately. This normally only happen if users did something like `incoming.take(x)`. To prevent that from closing up abruptly, you could chain, like `incoming.take(x).chain(stream::empty())`.\r\n- If there is an error trying to accept a connection (or spawning the HTTP connection task), currently the error is returned immediately. Should it instead hold the error briefly and start a graceful shutdown, and then return the error in the end?\r\n  - Answer: this will return the error immediately, since running while an error occurred could be dangerous. Adding a way to change this in a future change is a possibility.\r\n\r\nCloses #1575
