does seem like either we could add a second example in `examples/`, or add a better second guide at https://hyper.rs/guides/client/`.\r\n\r\nFor an immediate answer, you've got two-ish easy possibilities:\r\n\r\n- [`Stream::concat2`](https://docs.rs/futures/0.1.*/futures/stream/trait.Stream.html#method.concat2): returns a `Future<Item=Chunk>`, so that at the end, all the data of the body has been conbined into a single buffer, allowing to easily then pass into `serde_json`.\r\n- [`Stream::collect`](https://docs.rs/futures/0.1.*/futures/stream/trait.Stream.html#method.collect): returns a `Future<Item=Vec<Chunk>>`, where you have a list of buffers of the full body, but not yet combined into a single buffer. This second option *can* be useful if you don't need to copy all the bytes into a single buffer, in which case this reduces a bunch of copies, but can be a little more difficult if you really need a single buffer.\r\n\r\nAn example using the first:\r\n\r\n```rust\r\nclient\r\n    .get(uri)\r\n    .and_then(|res| {\r\n        res.into_body().concat2()\r\n    })\r\n    .and_then(|body| {\r\n        // try to parse as json, perhaps with serde_json\r\n        serde_json::from_slice(&body)\r\n            .map_err(|e| handle_json_error(e))\r\n    })\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor anyone wanting this already implemented, you may wish to look at [reqwest](https://crates.io/crates/reqwest), which has this built-n as [`Response::json()`](https://docs.rs/reqwest/0.8.*reqwest/struct.Response.html#method.json)\r\n\r\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hyperium/hyper/issues/comments/400041511/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"seanmonstar","id":51479,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxNDc5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/51479?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar","html_url":"https://github.com/seanmonstar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"actor":null,"created_at":"2018-06-30T06:41:54Z","updated_at":"2018-06-30T06:41:54Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hyperium/hyper/issues/1588","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hyperium/hyper","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hyperium/hyper/issues/1588/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hyperium/hyper/issues/1588/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hyperium/hyper/issues/1588/events","html_url":"https://github.com/hyperium/hyper/pull/1588","id":337192237,"node_id":"MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0MTk4NDYzMDk5","number":1588,"title":"Add
