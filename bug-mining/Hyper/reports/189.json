I have a minimal reproduction here: https://github.com/luben/repro-hyper\r\n\r\nThe reproduction is simplified work queue - workers wait on `GET /next`, clients submit work to `POST /`, worker submit response to `POST /response`.  What happens is that if a worker restarts, it is left  registered but disconnected and it leads to next client request to hang. I added a small debugging class that tells me when the futures are dropped. It confirms that the response future from /next is not dropped on worker disconnect.\r\n\r\nChanging the workers to use HTTP/2 instead of HTTP/1.1 (un-comment https://github.com/luben/repro-hyper/blob/master/src/bin/worker.rs#L16) solves the issue.\r\n\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"seanmonstar","id":51479,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxNDc5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/51479?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar","html_url":"https://github.com/seanmonstar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hyperium/hyper/issues/1716/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hyperium/hyper/issues/1716/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
