just created an PR for resolving this issue, just adding `http1_only` to `Connection` and `Builder`.\r\n\r\nThe flag field `http2` in the struct `Http` has replaced with an enum which has three modes (http1_only, http2_only and fallback).\r\nWhen `http2_only(false)` or `http1_only(false)` are called, the inner mode is set to \"fallback\".","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hyperium/hyper/issues/comments/394206428/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"ubnt-intrepid","id":7354350,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjczNTQzNTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7354350?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ubnt-intrepid","html_url":"https://github.com/ubnt-intrepid","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ubnt-intrepid/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ubnt-intrepid/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ubnt-intrepid/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ubnt-intrepid/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ubnt-intrepid/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ubnt-intrepid/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ubnt-intrepid/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ubnt-intrepid/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ubnt-intrepid/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":1661801628,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MTY2MTgwMTYyOA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hyperium/hyper/issues/events/1661801628","actor":{"login":"seanmonstar","id":51479,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxNDc5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/51479?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar","html_url":"https://github.com/seanmonstar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-06-04T16:57:20Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":1661801677,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDE2NjE4MDE2Nzc=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hyperium/hyper/issues/events/1661801677","actor":{"login":"seanmonstar","id":51479,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxNDc5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/51479?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar","html_url":"https://github.com/seanmonstar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"14d9246de2e97908c915caf254a37fd62edb25d3","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hyperium/hyper/commits/14d9246de2e97908c915caf254a37fd62edb25d3","created_at":"2018-06-04T16:57:21Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
