discussed in #1128, there is good reason to consider having 2 different error types, and they would be useful for the `Client` as well. The `hyper::Error` is the correct error type for the `Client` to return from its `Future`, as well as from the response's body stream.\r\n\r\nHowever, It does not makes sense for the **request body stream** to require sending a `hyper::Error` if generating the body failed. In that case, nothing in hyper failed, and the only relevant thing to hyper is that the stream cannot be completed. So the error type sent should be some sort of `Disconnect` or `Abort` or whatever, since an error on the body stream means the only thing hyper can reasonably do is to give up on the connection.\r\n\r\nAs in the server issue, the `From<std::io::Error>` and `From<hyper::Error>` implementations would be useful to allow easily sending streams from other sources, but it would be clear that the actual error type means \"kill it dead.\"\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nNew proposal: #1431

of the [Error reform](#1129).\r\n\r\n## Motivation\r\n\r\nUnlike the `hyper::Error`, which is meant to describe an error that occurred *inside hyper* and that information given the user, there a few instances where the **user must tell hyper** that an error has happened outside, and to stop it's scheduled action.\r\n\r\n- In the Client (see also #1130):\r\n  - The user can create a `Request<B>`, with a custom `Stream`. They may need to tell hyper that the stream cannot be completed.\r\n- In the Server (see also #1128):\r\n  - The user can create a `Response<B>`, with the same characterics and needs as the Client's `Request<B>`.\r\n  - The user can provide a `Service` (and `NewService`), which returns `Future<Item=Response<B>>`, where that `Future` might also fail in creating a `Response`. In most cases, a robust server will want to send a response anyways, with a 4XX or 5XX status code, but there could exist instances where the user can't even (or doesn't want to) create those responses.\r\n\r\nWhile hyper was using tokio-proto, there was a limitation on what error types could be used (only a single error type was allowed), but now that hyper has moved off, we can solve this (even now, before 0.12, I believe).\r\n\r\n## Design\r\n\r\n(updated from https://github.com/hyperium/hyper/issues/1431#issuecomment-374313124)\r\n\r\nAllow `E: Into<Box<std::error::Error>>` in any place a user could return an error to hyper. That means:\r\n\r\n- In the server, `Service::Error: Into<Box<std::error::Error>>`.\r\n- The body streams (`Entity`) a user can provide should be changed to just `type Error: Into<Box<std::error::Error>>;`\r\n- The `Connect` trait should update to `type Error: Into<Box<std::error::Error>>`, and the bounds `C::Error: io::Error` on client should be removed.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hyperium/hyper/issues/1431/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hyperium/hyper/issues/1431/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":1561765780,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDE1NjE3NjU3ODA=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hyperium/hyper/issues/events/1561765780","actor":{"login":"seanmonstar","id":51479,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxNDc5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/51479?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar","html_url":"https://github.com/seanmonstar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"16b04fa9a334bc90895b970bb0e0bb69baba28df","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hyperium/hyper/commits/16b04fa9a334bc90895b970bb0e0bb69baba28df","created_at":"2018-04-06T21:12:46Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"actor":{"login":"seanmonstar","id":51479,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxNDc5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/51479?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar","html_url":"https://github.com/seanmonstar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-04-06T21:13:43Z","updated_at":"2018-04-06T21:13:43Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hyperium/hyper/issues/1480","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hyperium/hyper","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hyperium/hyper/issues/1480/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hyperium/hyper/issues/1480/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hyperium/hyper/issues/1480/events","html_url":"https://github.com/hyperium/hyper/pull/1480","id":312120585,"node_id":"MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0MTgwMDU1ODMy","number":1480,"title":"feat(error):

The `cause` can\r\nalso be inspected, like before. This likely seems like a downgrade, but\r\nmore inspection can be added as needed!\r\n\r\nThe `Error` now knows about more states, which gives much more context\r\naround when a certain error occurs.

Starting in Rust 1.26, you could\r\n  just label that as `!` if you never return an error.\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hyperium/hyper/issues/1480/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hyperium/hyper/issues/1480/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":1561997303,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDE1NjE5OTczMDM=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hyperium/hyper/issues/events/1561997303","actor":{"login":"seanmonstar","id":51479,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxNDc5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/51479?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar","html_url":"https://github.com/seanmonstar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"080c96ddfc8934cd2a5bf5726bb8f6be6b713800","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hyperium/hyper/commits/080c96ddfc8934cd2a5bf5726bb8f6be6b713800","created_at":"2018-04-07T01:48:09Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":1562003870,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDE1NjIwMDM4NzA=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hyperium/hyper/issues/events/1562003870","actor":{"login":"seanmonstar","id":51479,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxNDc5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/51479?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar","html_url":"https://github.com/seanmonstar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"541563a14b683d8b3b7cceca2186b76721c06873","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hyperium/hyper/commits/541563a14b683d8b3b7cceca2186b76721c06873","created_at":"2018-04-07T02:10:33Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":1562010818,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDE1NjIwMTA4MTg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hyperium/hyper/issues/events/1562010818","actor":{"login":"seanmonstar","id":51479,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxNDc5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/51479?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar","html_url":"https://github.com/seanmonstar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"e4f47ce106dd370e6f12afd0ef2cd82ab0d9a242","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hyperium/hyper/commits/e4f47ce106dd370e6f12afd0ef2cd82ab0d9a242","created_at":"2018-04-07T02:36:42Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":1567226878,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDE1NjcyMjY4Nzg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hyperium/hyper/issues/events/1567226878","actor":{"login":"seanmonstar","id":51479,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxNDc5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/51479?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar","html_url":"https://github.com/seanmonstar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/following{/oth
