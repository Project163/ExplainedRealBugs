The left 2/3rds change colour to indicate problems and should be a mass of green.\n2. The right 1/3rd doesn't indicate status and should be a neutral blue.\n3. Source badges to the left of release badges (coverage before crates)\n4. License can be counted as either source or release\n\nThat way, I can use the row of badges as a simple status dashboard.\n\nSticking the crates badge so close to the status-indicating badges knocks my brain off the fast-path evaluation because I actually have to read to determine whether the orange indicates a problem rather than scanning my eyes over a row of colours.\n\nPerhaps this so that it's clear that the \"blue stuff\" section has already started?\n\n[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/hyperium/hyper.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/hyperium/hyper) [![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/hyperium/hyper/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://coveralls.io/r/hyperium/hyper?branch=master) [![MIT licensed](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-blue.svg)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hyperium/hyper/master/LICENSE) [![crates.io](http://meritbadge.herokuapp.com/hyper)](https://crates.io/crates/hyper)\n\nIdeally, there'd be an option to use a crates.io badge in a colour that either means \"all good\" (green) or lies outside the \"green through red\" spectrum that intuitively indicates status.
