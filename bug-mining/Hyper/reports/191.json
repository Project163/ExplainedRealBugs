This concept is similar to Netty's [AdaptiveRecvByteBufAllocator](https://github.com/netty/netty/blob/4.1/transport/src/main/java/io/netty/channel/AdaptiveRecvByteBufAllocator.java).\r\n\r\n- After a `read` on the transport, the number of bytes read should be compared with the current guess size.\r\n  - If the number of bytes is significantly less, the guess should be lowered.\r\n  - If the number of bytes is significantly more, the guess should raised.\r\n- It should likely make use of \"steps\". Something like starting at 1024 and doubling each step is probably a good start.\r\n- If the bytes read stays within the current step, no adjustment is needed.","closed_by":{"login":"seanmonstar","id":51479,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxNDc5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/51479?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar","html_url":"https://github.com/seanmonstar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hyperium/hyper/issues/1708/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hyperium/hyper/issues/1708/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
