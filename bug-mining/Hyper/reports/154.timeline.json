introduces the `hyper::service` module, which replaces\r\n`tokio-service`.\r\n\r\nSince the trait is specific to hyper, its associated\r\ntypes have been adjusted. It didn't make sense to need to define\r\n`Service<Request=http::Request>`, since we already know the context is\r\nHTTP. Instead, the request and response bodies are associated types now,\r\nand slightly stricter bounds have been placed on `Error`.\r\n\r\nThe helpers `service_fn` and `service_fn_ok` should be sufficient for\r\nnow to ease creating `Service`s.\r\n\r\nThe `NewService` trait now allows service creation to also be\r\nasynchronous.\r\n\r\nThese traits are similar to `tower` in nature, and possibly will be\r\nreplaced completely by it in the future. For now, hyper defining its own\r\nallows the traits to have better context, and prevents breaking changes\r\nin `tower` from affecting hyper.\r\n\r\nCloses #1461\r\n\r\nBREAKING CHANGE: The `Service` trait has changed: it has some changed\r\n  associated types, and `call` is now bound to `&mut self`.\r\n\r\n  The `NewService` trait has changed: it has some changed associated\r\n  types, and `new_service` now returns a `Future`.\r\n\r\n  `Client` no longer implements `Service` for now.\r\n\r\n  `hyper::server::conn::Serve` now returns `Connecting` instead of\r\n  `Connection`s, since `new_service` can now return a `Future`. The\r\n  `Connecting` is a future wrapping the new service future, returning\r\n  a `Connection` afterwards. In many cases, `Future::flatten` can be\r\n  used.\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hyperium/hyper/issues/1490/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hyperium/hyper/issues/1490/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":1580260375,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDE1ODAyNjAzNzU=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hyperium/hyper/issues/events/1580260375","actor":{"login":"seanmonstar","id":51479,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxNDc5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/51479?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar","html_url":"https://github.com/seanmonstar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"2dc6202fe7294fa74cf1ba58a45e48b8a927934f","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hyperium/hyper/commits/2dc6202fe7294fa74cf1ba58a45e48b8a927934f","created_at":"2018-04-18T00:09:24Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":1582442167,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MTU4MjQ0MjE2Nw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hyperium/hyper/issues/events/1582442167","actor":{"login":"seanmonstar","id":51479,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxNDc5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/51479?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar","html_url":"https://github.com/seanmonstar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-04-18T21:11:37Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
