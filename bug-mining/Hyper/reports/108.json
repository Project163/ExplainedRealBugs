Some options include:\r\n\r\n- Similar to how golang does it, provide a method on `Request`, like `request.set_proxy_url(url)`. The downside is that the knowledge that a proxy is being used is inside the `Connect` part of the `Client`, and so knowing to use this requires knowing that the `Connect` is using a proxy.\r\n- Somehow expose this intent on the `Connect` trait. Downside is that it means that `Connect` cannot be simply be `Service<Request=Url, Response=Io>`. Maybe that's not too bad.\r\n\r\nWithout this issue solved, it's impossible to talk to HTTP/1 proxies.","closed_by":{"login":"seanmonstar","id":51479,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxNDc5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/51479?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar","html_url":"https://github.com/seanmonstar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hyperium/hyper/issues/1056/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hyperium/hyper/issues/1056/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
