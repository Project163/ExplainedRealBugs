However, in hyper, if the body part is empty, e.g. `Body::empty()` or `Body::from_static(b\"\")`, hyper server doesn't send `b\"0\\r\\n\\r\\n\"` to the client, causing infitite wait on the client side. When the body contains some bytes, e.g. `Body::from_static(b\"0\")`, hyper will send a non-zero size chunk as well as a zero-size last chunk. According to pseudo code from [RFC9112 7.1.3](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9112#name-decoding-chunked), zero size body should be allowed.\r\n\r\nI expect hyper sends valid last chunk `b\"0\\r\\n\\r\\n\"` to the client when the body is empty. Manually sending it is impossible with public API so I have no workaround now.\r\n\r\n\r\nSource code to reproduce the behavior:\r\n```rust\r\nasync fn get_302() -> anyhow::Result<Response<Body>> {\r\n    let resp_builder = http::response::Builder::new();\r\n    let (mut parts, body) = resp_builder\r\n        .status(302)\r\n        .version(Version::HTTP_11)\r\n        .header(header::LOCATION, \"127.0.0.1:1234/ok\")\r\n        .header(header::TRANSFER_ENCODING, \"chunked\")\r\n        .body(Body::empty())\r\n        .unwrap().into_parts();\r\n    Ok(Response::from_parts(parts, body))\r\n}\r\n\r\nasync fn run_server() {\r\n    let listener = TcpListener::bind(\"127.0.0.1:1234\").await.unwrap();\r\n    let service = service_fn(|req| {\r\n        get_302()\r\n    });\r\n    while let (conn, _) = listener.accept().await.unwrap() {\r\n        let _ = Http::new().http1_only(true).serve_connection(conn, service).await;\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\n#[tokio::main]\r\nasync fn main() {\r\n    run_server().await\r\n}\r\n```","closed_by":{"login":"seanmonstar","id":51479,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxNDc5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/51479?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar","html_url":"https://github.com/seanmonstar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hyperium/hyper/issues/3252/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hyperium/hyper/issues/3252/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
