Firefox for example has some logic to content-sniff the start of an actual `HTTP/1.*` response in the first 4KB of received data on the first request made on the connection, and this is obviously not code that should live in httparse.\r\n\r\nAs a start, I feel like Hyper should check whether the response starts with \"HTTP\" at the beginning of the data it received, and if not, maybe it should pretend it saw `HTTP/1.0 200 OK\\r\\n\\r\\n`.\r\n\r\nI say `HTTP/1.0` and not `HTTP/0.9` because it is literally impossible for `httparse::Response` to represent `0.9` in its version field.","closed_by":{"login":"seanmonstar","id":51479,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxNDc5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/51479?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar","html_url":"https://github.com/seanmonstar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hyperium/hyper/issues/2468/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":1},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hyperium/hyper/issues/2468/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
