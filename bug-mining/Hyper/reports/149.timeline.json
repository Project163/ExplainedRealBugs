correct, and they probably wouldn't ever need to change But, the enum might need to grow new generic parameters, which could also be problematic.

I don't yet now what the quite looks like. Should it be the `Request` plus a future of the response? Maybe something like:\r\n\r\n```rust\r\n#[non_exhaustive]\r\nenum Frame<B, PPF> {\r\n    Data(B),\r\n    Trailers(HeaderMap),\r\n    PushPromise(Request<NoBody>, PPF),\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAdding that generic would be a breaking change. So then, do we not allow passing a future? Or do we require boxing it? Or maybe we require a specific `PushPromiseFuture` that has an associated sender?\r\n\r\nI'm not sure. And, if we later decide that the current design sucks, we're completely stuck with it. If we deprecate the variant and try a `PushPromise2` that is a million times better, then we can't actually use it or anyone who was using the previous variant is busted.

Response::new().with_body(gzip(response.body()))\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut as far as I can tell, the only tool Body gives us is `Body::pair()` so I suppose we do something like this:\r\n\r\n```rust\r\nfn gzip(pool: CpuPool, body: Body) -> Body {\r\n    let stream = body.and_then(|chunk| compress(chunk));\r\n    let (tx, body) = Body::pair();\r\n    pool.spawn(tx.send_all(stream.map(Ok).map_err(|_| unreachable!())))\r\n        .forget();\r\n    body\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt's not very user friendly. Nor am I sure if I implemented that correctly. It doesn't seem like the right abstraction for when you just want to transform the chunk stream.\r\n\r\nFor example, imagine if:\r\n\r\n- The body::Inner enum had a new variant `Stream(Box<Stream<Chunk, Error>>)`\r\n- Body's poll() impl had a new branch `Stream(stream) => stream.poll()`\r\n- Body had a new constructor `Body::stream(stream)`","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hyperium/hyper/issues/1468/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hyperium/hyper/issues/1468/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":2325229525,"node_id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDIzMjUyMjk1MjU=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hyperium/hyper/issues/events/2325229525","actor":{"login":"seanmonstar","id":51479,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxNDc5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/51479?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar","html_url":"https://github.com/seanmonstar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-05-07T19:04:47Z","label":{"name":"A-body","color":"fbca04"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2325229527,"node_id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDIzMjUyMjk1Mjc=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hyperium/hyper/issues/events/2325229527","actor":{"login":"seanmonstar","id":51479,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxNDc5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/51479?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar","html_url":"https://github.com/seanmonstar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-05-07T19:04:47Z","label":{"name":"S-feature","color":"f9d0c4"},"performed_via_github_app":null}]
