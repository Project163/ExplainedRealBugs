API I've been prototyping has a similar look to the [h2 client](https://docs.rs/h2/0.1.*/h2/client/index.html), where you provide an already connected `io`, and get back a sender (`SendRequest`?) and `Connection` pair. You probably want to just spawn the `Connection` into an executor, and then use the sender to send requests, but there are methods on `Connection` to allow finer control.\r\n\r\nAt this level, the internals can be configured to allow HTTP upgrades and CONNECTs (where as the higher level `Client` and `Server` treat them as errors, since there's no exposed API to handle them yet). After a user sends a request wanting an upgrade, and gets a `101` response back, they could coordinate to get the original `io` back out of the `Connection`. There's a few parts of this that may be tricky. Details next.\r\n\r\n## `SendRequest`\r\n\r\n- This has a `poll_ready` method, allowing you to know if the related `Connection` is still usable.\r\n- There is a `send_request(&mut self, req: Request<B>)` method, similar to `Client::request(req)`.\r\n\r\n**Questions:**\r\n\r\n- What should this be called? `SendRequest`? `Sender`?\r\n- What should the `send_request` method be called? `send_request`? `request`? `send`?\r\n- Should this type be `Clone`?\r\n\r\n## `Connection`\r\n\r\n- The easiest thing is to just have `Connection::into_inner(self) -> Io`, however, servers can send the 101 upgrade response and the first part of the new protocol in the same packet. If they do that, the internal state will likely have those bytes in its read buffer. So, just calling `conn.into_inner()` would mean losing data. For that reason, I'm wondering if it is better to just remove this possible footgun.\r\n- The next thing that could be done is have `Connection::into_parts(self) -> Parts<Io>`. This is kind of like [http's into_parts](https://docs.rs/http/0.1.*/http/request/struct.Request.html#method.into_parts), which returns a struct with public fields, and a private one, allowing the possibility of adding new fields, while also allowing a user to take ownership of multiple things at once.\r\n\r\n  ```rust\r\n  pub struct Parts<T> {\r\n      pub io: T,\r\n      pub read_buf: Bytes,\r\n      _non_exhaustive: (),\r\n  }\r\n  ```\r\n- By default, the `impl Future for Connection` assumes it should manage the socket until completion, and then call `AsyncWrite::shutdown()`. However, if you're wanting to do an upgrade, you don't want `shutdown` to be called, but you do want to know when the `Connection` is otherwise \"done\" with HTTP. So, there probably needs to be another `poll_*` method to do that.\r\n\r\n**Questions:**\r\n\r\n- Should there be an `into_inner()` that could possibly lose data?\r\n-  If you were to call `into_inner` or `into_parts` at some arbitrary time, even if there wasn't an upgrade, there could be unfinished state internally. Should it be an error to do that? Or should that extra state be available the `Parts` struct?\r\n- What should `Parts` be called? Is `Parts` too vague (`hyper::client::conn::Parts`)? I didn't want to say specifically `Upgrade`, since you might use it without an upgrade...\r\n- What buffer should be returned in `Parts`? It is internally a `BytesMut`, but we may not want to expose that directly. It's not hard to convert almost anything into a `Bytes`, so I started with that...\r\n- Should `Parts` include both the `read_buf` and `write_buf`?\r\n- What should the secondary `poll_` method be called, that resolves when HTTP is finished but without calling `shutdown`? `Connection::poll_upgrade()`? What should it return? Should it return an `Error` if the connection is closed without a successful upgrade? Or should that be an `Ok` result, just with an additional `enum`?\r\n\r\n## Example\r\n\r\nHere's an example that I'm currently using in tests (with `await` inserted for terseness):\r\n\r\n```rust\r\nuse hyper::client::conn;\r\n\r\n// connect a tcpstream somehow, and then...\r\nlet (mut tx, mut conn) = await conn::handshake(io)?;\r\nlet until_upgrade = future::poll_fn(|| conn.poll_upgrade());\r\n\r\n// using `http` crate\r\nlet req = Request::builder()\r\n    .uri(uri)\r\n    .header(\"upgrade\", \"foobar\")\r\n    .header(\"connection\", \"upgrade\")\r\n    .body(Body::empty())\r\n    .unwrap();\r\n\r\nlet upgrade = tx.send_request(req)\r\n    .map(|res| {\r\n        assert_eq!(res.status(), StatusCode::SWITCHING_PROTOCOLS);\r\n        assert_eq!(res.headers()[\"upgrade\"], \"foobar\");\r\n    });\r\n\r\nawait upgrade.join(until_upgrade)?;\r\n\r\nlet tcp = conn.into_parts().io;\r\n// use tcp over 'foobar' protocol\r\n```","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hyperium/hyper/issues/comments/368121931/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"seanmonstar","id":51479,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxNDc5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/51479?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar","html_url":"https://github.com/seanmonstar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"actor":{"login":"seanmonstar","id":51479,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxNDc5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/51479?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar","html_url":"https://github.com/seanmonstar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-02-23T20:00:00Z","updated_at":"2018-02-23T20:00:00Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hyperium/hyper/issues/1395","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hyperium/hyper","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hyperium/hyper/issues/1395/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hyperium/hyper/issues/1395/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hyperium/hyper/issues/1395/events","html_url":"https://github.com/hyperium/hyper/issues/1395","id":279965200,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWUyNzk5NjUyMDA=","number":1395,"title":"Client
