Http type learns a new method, bind_upgradable_connection, which returns a Future. This method behaves like bind_connection, except the Service supplied must return an UpgradableResponse containing either an HTTP Response or some information describing a protocol switch. If an Upgrade response is returned, the server task is shut down (without closing the underlying io) and this information is forwarded to the Future, along with the underlying io and any remaining buffered data that has already been read from it.\r\n\r\nIf the server task shuts down normally, the Future completes with a None output value. In the case of an error handling the connection, the error is also forwarded to the Future.\r\n\r\nThis allows for implementing servers with hyper that can upgrade their connections to different protocols, such as WebSockets, in response to client requests. Such protocols can be implemented outside of hyper itself. The API is designed to allow for potentially multiple upgrade paths out of an HTTP exchange, with the upgrade information attached to the UpgradableResponse::Upgrade signal determining which is used.\r\n\r\nA companion crate implementing WebSocket upgrades can be found [here](https://github.com/spinda/hyper-websocket), with sample code [here](https://github.com/spinda/hyper-websocket/blob/416ca8588931aa92a737c9c1a4afef2bef5d24b6/tests/test.rs).\r\n\r\nImportantly, the code path for normal, non-upgradable connections is entirely untouched by this addition.\r\n\r\n- [x] The commit messages match the guidelines in https://github.com/hyperium/hyper/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#git-commit-guidelines","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hyperium/hyper/issues/1287/reactions","total_count":11,"+1":5,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":6,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hyperium/hyper/issues/1287/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":1252309481,"node_id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDEyNTIzMDk0ODE=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hyperium/hyper/issues/events/1252309481","actor":{"login":"seanmonstar","id":51479,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxNDc5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/51479?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar","html_url":"https://github.com/seanmonstar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2017-09-16T23:32:13Z","label":{"name":"E-medium","color":"0e8a16"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":1252309482,"node_id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDEyNTIzMDk0ODI=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hyperium/hyper/issues/events/1252309482","actor":{"login":"seanmonstar","id":51479,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxNDc5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/51479?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar","html_url":"https://github.com/seanmonstar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2017-09-16T23:32:13Z","label":{"name":"S-feature","color":"fc2929"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hyperium/hyper/issues/comments/333092481","html_url":"https://github.com/hyperium/hyper/issues/1323#issuecomment-333092481","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hyperium/hyper/issues/1323","id":333092481,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMzMzA5MjQ4MQ==","user":{"login":"lqf96","id":11476527,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNDc2NTI3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11476527?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lqf96","html_url":"https://github.com/lqf96","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lqf96/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lqf96/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lqf96/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lqf96/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lqf96/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lqf96/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lqf96/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lqf96/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lqf96/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-09-29T10:33:40Z","updated_at":"2017-09-29T10:33:40Z","body":"This is a great idea, but what about handling CONNECT method at the server side (like in a HTTP proxy server)?

The original socket does not get upgraded out of h2, it just sends and receives `DATA` frames on the same stream, and it should be forwarded to the target host. So, when hyper gains HTTP/2 support, it would be wrong to pull the socket out because some stream sent a `CONNECT`. It would need to continue to just stream bytes back and forth.\r\n\r\nAs for handling the response yourself, the thing is that you need to return a `Response` anyways, so it seems useful to be able to fill in the status code and headers, and let hyper write that to the
