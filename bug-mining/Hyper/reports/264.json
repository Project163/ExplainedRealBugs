But there's no equivalent `local_addr()` method. `TcpStream` has [such a method](https://docs.rs/tokio/1.17.0/tokio/net/struct.TcpStream.html#method.local_addr), but the only way to get that from `AddrStream` is [`AddrStream::to_inner()`](https://docs.rs/hyper/0.14.17/hyper/server/conn/struct.AddrStream.html#method.into_inner) that consumes the `AddrStream` entirely (which is to say, there's no `as_inner()` method to get a reference).\r\n\r\nThis is really frustrating because I want to log the local IP address on incoming connections (I'm listening on `0.0.0.0` and I want to know which interface the connection is coming in on). So I either need an `AddrStream::local_addr()` method or I need an `AddrStream::as_inner()` method[^as_ref] that I can then use to call `TcpStream::local_addr()`.\r\n\r\n[^as_ref]: Or maybe an `<AddrStream as AsRef<TcpStream>>` impl.","closed_by":{"login":"seanmonstar","id":51479,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxNDc5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/51479?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar","html_url":"https://github.com/seanmonstar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hyperium/hyper/issues/2773/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hyperium/hyper/issues/2773/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
