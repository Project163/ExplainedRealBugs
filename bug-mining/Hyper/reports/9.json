I think the reason for this is that hyper sets the `Host` header of the client request to `localhost`, not `localhost:<port>` as it should.\n\nThe header is set here: https://github.com/hyperium/hyper/blob/50a6f6103e842102ccb03e8e49bf8f412fd166bc/src/client/request.rs#L62\nThe host the header is set to is extracted from the `Url`here: https://github.com/hyperium/hyper/blob/50a6f6103e842102ccb03e8e49bf8f412fd166bc/src/client/request.rs#L48\n\nI've confirmed that `serialize_host` omits the port. Example code:\n\n``` Rust\nuse hyper::Url;\n\nlet url = Url::parse(\"http://localhost:12345/some-url\").unwrap();\nprint!(\"url: {}\\n\", url);\nprint!(\"url.serialize_host().unwrap(): {}\\n\", url.serialize_host().unwrap());\n```\n\nOutput:\n\n```\nurl: http://localhost:12345/some-url\nurl.serialize_host().unwrap(): localhost\n```\n\nWhat I don't know is whether the problem lies with `serialize_host` or if it is used incorrectly in `Request::with_stream`. Any thoughts?\n","closed_by":{"login":"seanmonstar","id":51479,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxNDc5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/51479?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar","html_url":"https://github.com/seanmonstar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hyperium/hyper/issues/88/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hyperium/hyper/issues/88/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
