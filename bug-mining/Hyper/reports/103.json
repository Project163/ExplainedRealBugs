We can start with keeping a single `String`, and then keeping indices into it to know where the `path` and `query` are.\r\n\r\nIn HTTP2, the URI would gain additional fields, `scheme` and `authority` (what is in HTTP1 the `Host` header), and the `asterisk-form` request target is defined as `path = *`.\r\n\r\nWe could eventually change the internal source representation to be a `MemSlice` or whatever it is at that point, to reduce a further copy.\r\n\r\nSome quick code describing what it could look like:\r\n\r\n```rust\r\npub struct Uri {\r\n    source: String,\r\n    scheme_end: Option<usize>,\r\n    authority_end: Option<usize>,\r\n    query: Option<usize>,\r\n}\r\n\r\nimpl Uri {\r\n    pub fn path(&self) -> &str {\r\n        let index = self.scheme_end.unwrap_or(0) + self.authority_end.unwrap_or(0);\r\n        let end = self.query.unwrap_or(self.source.len());\r\n        &self.source[index..end]\r\n    }\r\n    // .. and other accessors\r\n}\r\n\r\nlet star = Uri::from_str(\"*\").unwrap();\r\nassert_eq!(Uri {\r\n    source: String::from(\"*\"),\r\n    scheme_end: None,\r\n    authority_end: None,\r\n    query: None,\r\n}, star);\r\nassert_eq!(star.path(), \"*\");\r\n\r\nlet common = Uri::from_str(\"/p?foo=bar\").unwrap();\r\nassert_eq!(Uri {\r\n    source: String::from(\"/p?foo=bar\"),\r\n    scheme_end: None,\r\n    authority_end: None,\r\n    query: Some(2),\r\n}, common);\r\nassert_eq!(common.path(), \"/p\");\r\nassert_eq!(common.query(), \"?foo=bar\");\r\n```\r\n\r\ncc @GuillaumeGomez\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"seanmonstar","id":51479,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxNDc5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/51479?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar","html_url":"https://github.com/seanmonstar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hyperium/hyper/issues/1000/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hyperium/hyper/issues/1000/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
