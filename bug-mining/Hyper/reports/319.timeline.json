Motivation\r\n\r\nCurrently, the header read timeout is started before any part of the first request is received. This allows closing the connection if no requests are received. However, after the first request, the connection can remain open indefinitely. This change ensures that the header read timeout is started immediately after the connection is idle, following the transmission of the response, before the first part of the subsequent request is received.\r\n\r\nThis is particularly relevant in the case that browsers open 6+ h1 connections when a page loads and then neglect to close any of them, distracting, in my case, from DDoS attackers.\r\n\r\nThis is kind of like an \"idle timeout\"\r\n\r\n## Changes\r\n- [x] Start `header_read_timeout` when waiting for subsequent requests\r\n- [x] `Error::is_timeout` returns true on `HeaderTimeout`\r\n\r\n## Tests\r\n- [x] Fix existing tests, which failed due to invalid headers, not timeouts\r\n  - `header_read_timeout_slow_writes`\r\n  - `header_read_timeout_slow_writes_multiple_requests`\r\n- [x] Test new functionality \r\n  - I've manually confirmed that the new test fails without the change\r\n\r\n## Open question\r\n\r\nShould the [documentation of `header_read_timeout`](https://docs.rs/hyper/latest/hyper/server/conn/http1/struct.Builder.html#method.header_read_timeout) change? It currently doesn't say when the timeout is started, only when it finishes (client transmits entire header).\r\n\r\n## Related\r\n\r\nRelated: #1628\r\nRelated/Fixes: #2355\r\nRelated https://github.com/hyperium/hyper/pull/3185#issuecomment-2590646026\r\nBuilds on and supersedes/Closes #3781 (credit to @T-aian)\r\nFixes #3780\r\nSupersedes #3743 (this PR required additional complexity, but allowed a different value for the header read timeout and the idle timeout)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hyperium/hyper/issues/3828/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hyperium/hyper/issues/3828/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":16083709489,"node_id":"CE_lADOAWaYQc6drfUEzwAAAAO-qe4x","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hyperium/hyper/issues/events/16083709489","actor":{"login":"seanmonstar","id":51479,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxNDc5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/51479?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar","html_url":"https://github.com/seanmonstar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":"10b09ffc04a97bbc96444172b7c5e02665827c67","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hyperium/hyper/commits/10b09ffc04a97bbc96444172b7c5e02665827c67","created_at":"2025-01-27T20:23:48Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":16083709618,"node_id":"CE_lADOAWaYQc6drfUEzwAAAAO-qe6y","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hyperium/hyper/issues/events/16083709618","actor":{"login":"seanmonstar","id":51479,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxNDc5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/51479?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar","html_url":"https://github.com/seanmonstar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2025-01-27T20:23:48Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":16084947944,"node_id":"REFE_lADOAWaYQc6drfUEzwAAAAO-vNPo","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hyperium/hyper/issues/events/16084947944","actor":{"login":"pull[bot]","id":39814207,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90Mzk4MTQyMDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/12910?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pull%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/pull","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pull%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pull%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pull%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pull%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pull%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pull%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pull%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pull%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pull%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"10b09ffc04a97bbc96444172b7c5e02665827c67","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/dudw/hyper/commits/10b09ffc04a97bbc96444172b7c5e02665827c67","created_at":"2025-01-27T22:30:25Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":16388001851,"node_id":"REFE_lADOAWaYQc6drfUEzwAAAAPQzRA7","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hyperium/hyper/issues/events/16388001851","actor":{"login":"GlenDC","id":3900482,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5MDA0ODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3900482?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/GlenDC","html_url":"https://github.com/GlenDC","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GlenDC/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GlenDC/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GlenDC/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Glen
