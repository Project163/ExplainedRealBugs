For example:\r\n- If you're proxying, then there's a race between the 2 idle timeouts if they're the same.\r\n- The kernel buffers data that won't be immediately available in `poll*` functions (they'll receive a `Poll::Pending` even if there was actual data transmitted). So to figure it out, you also need to look at the `tcpinfo` struct you can get by doing a syscall and see how much data is \"notsent\". This adds blockage to normally non-blocking tasks. Even for a very short time, it can build up if you're handling a lot of connections.\r\n- For HTTP2/3, multiple requests can happen on the same connection, at the same time. It could be possible to close a whole connection if any client request takes too long to send its headers, but would that be desirable? That would break all other ongoing HTTP requests for the same connection.\r\n\r\n> There is a timeout field in https://recursion.wtf/embed-wasm/hyper/server/conn/struct.AddrIncoming.html but there is no way for the user to set it.\r\n\r\nThat looks like the timeout for when accepting fails (usually due to \"too many open files\"). It's set to a sleep w/ a duration of 1 second when an error happens, when it has elapsed, it is removed.\r\n\r\nEdit: I'm facing similar issues btw, I just thought I'd share my experience.","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hyperium/hyper/issues/comments/1706860135/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"jeromegn","id":43325,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzMzI1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/43325?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeromegn","html_url":"https://github.com/jeromegn","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeromegn/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeromegn/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeromegn/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeromegn/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeromegn/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeromegn/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeromegn/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeromegn/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeromegn/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":10389904903,"node_id":"UE_lADOAWaYQc4xS1HUzwAAAAJrSV4H","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hyperium/hyper/issues/events/10389904903","actor":{"login":"kzdnk","id":74667483,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc0NjY3NDgz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/74667483?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kzdnk","html_url":"https://github.com/kzdnk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kzdnk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kzdnk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kzdnk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kzdnk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kzdnk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kzdnk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kzdnk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kzdnk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kzdnk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"unsubscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2023-09-16T15:47:58Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"actor":{"login":"luyikk","id":16304584,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MzA0NTg0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16304584?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/luyikk","html_url":"https://github.com/luyikk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luyikk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luyikk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luyikk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luyikk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luyikk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luyikk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luyikk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luyikk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luyikk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-01-21T10:30:40Z","updated_at":"2024-01-21T10:30:40Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/salvo-rs/salvo/issues/661","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/salvo-rs/salvo","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/salvo-rs/salvo/issues/661/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/salvo-rs/salvo/issues/661/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/salvo-rs/salvo/issues/661/events","html_url":"https://github.com/salvo-rs/salvo/issues/661","id":2092523896,"node_id":"I_kwDODR_Dbs58uWF4","number":661,"title":"防御慢速HTTP攻击","user":{"login":"luyikk","id":16304584,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MzA0NTg0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16304584?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/luyikk","html_url":"https://github.com/luyikk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luyikk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luyikk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luyikk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luyikk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luyikk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luyikk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luyikk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luyikk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luyikk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2024-01-21T10:30:40Z","updated_at":"
