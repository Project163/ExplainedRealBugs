see. So it can either be `null`, or the full origin. It seems like any way to make this work with hyper's `Origin` header would require a breaking change. Since that's the case, my thinking is something like this, for inclusion in v0.11:\r\n\r\n```rust\r\npub struct Origin(OriginOrNull);\r\n\r\nenum OriginOrNull {\r\n    Origin {\r\n        scheme: String,\r\n        host: Host,\r\n    },\r\n    Null,\r\n}\r\n\r\nimpl Origin {\r\n    pub fn new<S: Into<String>, H: Into<String>>(scheme: S, hostname: H, port: Option<u16>) -> Origin{\r\n        Origin(OriginOrNull::Origin {\r\n            scheme: scheme.into(),\r\n            host: Host::new(hostname.into(), port),\r\n        })\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    pub fn null() -> Origin {\r\n
