1.5 server (HTTP1 mode)\r\n\r\n**Description**\r\nHey there, Hyper team! I've run into a bit of a pickle with Hyper 1.5 and the handling of 100-continue responses. Let me break it down:\r\n\r\n1. The newer streaming API (BodyStream) doesn't trigger an automatic 100-continue informational response when a data frame is polled. This is different from the older Body API, which sends the 100-continue when the body is first polled.\r\n\r\n2. Trying to send a 100-continue response manually in the application using `return Ok(Response::new(Body::empty()))` results in a runtime error: `UnsupportedStatusCode`. This leaves us in a bit of a bind.\r\n\r\n3. I've seen suggestions to inject the response at the TCP layer, but that's pretty awkward, especially when using TLS encryption. It feels like we're working against the library rather than with it.\r\n\r\nI'm curious why the logic that works for Body and the older API (as described in PR #2119, which added automatic 100-continue support for Body) doesn't work with BodyStream. That PR essentially made Hyper automatically send a 100-continue response when the body is first polled if the request included an Expect: 100-continue header.\r\n\r\nWould it be possible to implement support for the 100-continue response using the body streaming interface in the same way as it's done for Body? It seems like this would provide a consistent experience across both APIs.\r\n\r\nI noticed PR #3815, which adds support for sending informational responses. Will this solve the problem? It looks like it adds a `send_informational` method to the response, but I'm not sure if this will integrate with the automatic 100-continue behavior.\r\n\r\nThanks for your time, and I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts on this!\r\n\r\n**Related**\r\n- https://github.com/hyperium/hyper/issues/838\r\n- https://github.com/hyperium/hyper/issues/369\r\n- https://github.com/hyperium/hyper/issues/2743\r\n- https://github.com/hyperium/hyper/pull/2119\r\n- https://github.com/hyperium/hyper/pull/3815\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hyperium/hyper/issues/3827/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hyperium/hyper/issues/3827/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"not_planned"}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
