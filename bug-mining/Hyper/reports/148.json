A proposed API follows:\r\n\r\n## Proposal\r\n\r\n- `Response`\r\n  - `pub fn upgrade(proto: header::Upgrade) -> (Response, server::Upgrade)`\r\n    \r\n    This sets the `StatusCode::SwitchingProtocols`, and the `Upgrade` header provided. It returns the `Response`, in case other headers need to be added, and a `server::Upgrade` type, explained next.\r\n- `server::Upgrade`\r\n  - `impl Future for server::Upgrade`\r\n  - This type is a `Future` that resolves to the underlying IO object that is being upgraded.\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\n\r\n```rust\r\n// inside a `Service`\r\nfn call(&self, req: Request) -> Self::Future {\r\n    if wants_ws_upgrade(&req) {\r\n        let (res, upgrade) = Response::upgrade(Upgrade::ws());\r\n        self.ws_queue.send(res);\r\n        future::ok(res)\r\n    } else {\r\n        self.handle_http(req)\r\n    } \r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nA theoretical websocket server would also exist, and a channel, the `ws_queue`, would be used to give the socket to the websocket server.\r\n\r\n## Implementation\r\n\r\nThe `server::Upgrade` could wrap a `futures::sync::oneshot::Receiver`. The purpose for wrapping one is to hide the implementation details.\r\n\r\nWhen upgrading protocols, the response is only supposed to send headers. A blank newline after a header block with a `101` response code is supposed to be for the already upgraded protocol. That means sending a body with an upgrade response is an error.\r\n\r\nIf it is possible with some `Into` impls to allow `Response::upgrade` to return a `Response<()>`, that would probably be ideal. I imagine it might not be doable, in which case, it will need to be enforced at runtime. This will still work, as the `server::Upgrade` can be sent a `hyper::Error` noting that a body was illegal.\r\n\r\nIt would be nice if the type could be `server::Upgrade<T>`, where `T` is the specific IO type being used internally. However, that might not be possible either, as the `Service` may not have a way to know what type is being used (it might be possible for a user to have encoded the type in their `new_service`, and thus `Service`, and be able to statically guarantee the type, though!). If not, then the return type will need to be a `Box<AsyncRead + AsyncWrite>`.\r\n\r\nAny buffered bytes internally associated with the socket should be returned as well, as a `Chunk`.","closed_by":{"login":"seanmonstar","id":51479,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxNDc5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/51479?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar","html_url":"https://github.com/seanmonstar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hyperium/hyper/issues/1323/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hyperium/hyper/issues/1323/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
