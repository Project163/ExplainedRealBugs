This is about when a user receives a `hyper::Body` from hyper, the `<Body as Payload>::content_length()` call can try to give more information. This is especially useful if using that body to stream to a different message, such as in a proxy, having made a client request, and gotten a response back, and then returning that body as your own server's body.\r\n\r\nAs the documentation of `content_length` says, it's OK to not know the answer. It's just a hint to allow hyper to add a `content-length` header if not present. This in turn means that several common body cases will include a `content-length` header without forcing the user to remember it (like returning `Body::from(\"hello world\")`.","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hyperium/hyper/issues/comments/395859907/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"seanmonstar","id":51479,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxNDc5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/51479?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar","html_url":"https://github.com/seanmonstar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":1671603517,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MTY3MTYwMzUxNw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hyperium/hyper/issues/events/1671603517","actor":{"login":"lnicola","id":308347,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwODM0Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/308347?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lnicola","html_url":"https://github.com/lnicola","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lnicola/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lnicola/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lnicola/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lnicola/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lnicola/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lnicola/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lnicola/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lnicola/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lnicola/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-06-08T19:08:58Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":1671603518,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDE2NzE2MDM1MTg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hyperium/hyper/issues/events/1671603518","actor":{"login":"lnicola","id":308347,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwODM0Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/308347?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lnicola","html_url":"https://github.com/lnicola","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lnicola/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lnicola/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lnicola/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lnicola/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lnicola/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lnicola/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lnicola/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lnicola/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lnicola/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-06-08T19:08:58Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"actor":{"login":"lnicola","id":308347,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwODM0Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/308347?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lnicola","html_url":"https://github.com/lnicola","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lnicola/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lnicola/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lnicola/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lnicola/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lnicola/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lnicola/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lnicola/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lnicola/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lnicola/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-06-08T21:22:59Z","updated_at":"2018-06-08T21:22:59Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hyperium/hyper/issues/1556","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hyperium/hyper","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hyperium/hyper/issues/1556/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hyperium/hyper/issues/1556/comments","events_url":"https
