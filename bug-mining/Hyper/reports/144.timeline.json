as:\r\n```\r\nhttp://localhost:3000/1,2,3,4,5, ... etc. ... 499998,499999,500000\r\n```\r\nThen every HTTP client I use gets disconnected when making the request, with no status code returned by the server. E.g. using `curl` I get the following:\r\n```\r\ncurl: (55) Send failure: Broken pipe\r\n```\r\nUsing e.g. python's `requests` module, I get the error:\r\n```\r\nConnectionError: ('Connection aborted.', BrokenPipeError(32, 'Broken pipe'))\r\n```\r\nI was expecting to instead get a `414 (Request URI too long)` response instead (this is the behaviour for most other HTTP servers I've used the above request with).\r\n\r\nOne additional thing I tried was to make the above request to the https://github.com/iron/iron/blob/master/examples/error_recovery.rs example, this has the same behaviour (i.e. broken connection), with nothing being output from the server itself by any of the error handling code.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/iron/iron/issues/563/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/iron/iron/issues/563/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":12498527919,"node_id":"REFE_lADOAWaYQc4QJeOszwAAAALo-Gav","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hyperium/hyper/issues/events/12498527919","actor":{"login":"hjr3","id":33318,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzMzE4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/33318?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hjr3","html_url":"https://github.com/hjr3","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hjr3/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hjr3/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hjr3/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hjr3/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hjr3/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hjr3/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hjr3/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hjr3/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hjr3/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"d22deb6572c279e11773b6bcb862415c08f19c2e","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hjr3/hyper/commits/d22deb6572c279e11773b6bcb862415c08f19c2e","created_at":"2024-04-17T00:15:40Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
