the server where to find the file on hard disk if it needs to re-read it later.

Sec11.3](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6455#section-11.3) specifies several headers like `Sec-WebSocket-Protocol`.

However [http](https://docs.rs/http/0.2.1/http/) case every key to lowercase for convince. [hyper](https://docs.rs/hyper/0.13.5/hyper/) has an issue to solve this problem (https://github.com/hyperium/hyper/issues/1492), but not in http.
