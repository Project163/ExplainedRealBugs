Most all clients don't send a chunked message when there really isn't a body. The client interface was trying to guess if it was chunked. The newer `Client` struct should properly set `Content-Length: 0` when there is no body.\n2. Even so, if the server handler does not read the whole request body (if a client did POST data), and ignores it, then the data will still be in the pipe. The keep alive loop will read on the socket again to see if the connection has continue, and will find the rest of the POST body. This part means that the server perhaps needs to be adjusted somehow to make sure the full request is read, even if the `Handler` doesn't do
