found that we did discuss this some in #2572. I don't _think_ we'd update `http::HeaderMap` to include info on insertion order of duplicate values, since it'd be increasing the cost for a lot of users who don't need it. I see two other solutions and I'm not sure which is preferable:\r\n\r\n- Include the extra data specifically in `hyper_headers`, which would probably mean extending the existing `HeaderCaseMap` to include a memory of the order, or to make a separate _extra_ vec/map that has the order.\r\n- Change the test in curl from temporarily DISABLED `if hyper`, to be always disabled (so, moved out of the `DISABLED` file and have the condition in the `data/test580` instead) and tell users that is one of the differences.

I did this\r\nThe reason why the test 580 and 581 are failing are mentioned in detailed [in this issue](https://github.com/hyperium/hyper/issues/2780). The TLDR version is that `hyper` does not store HTTP headers in the order that they are received. `hyper` basically stores headers in hash map of \"HeaderName\" -> vec<\"HeaderValue\"> (This is an oversimplification, but will work for this discussion). This means the current implementation of [hyper_headers_foreach](https://docs.rs/hyper/latest/hyper/ffi/fn.hyper_headers_foreach.html#) ends up grouping the headers by header name. \r\n\r\n### I

for the slow response, I've been thinking about this and not been able to think of a good solution (and so haven't had something to say). \r\n\r\n- The `http::HeaderMap` is optimized for faster lookup, assuming that most in the Rust API want to `get` a specific name. We do that by making use of \"case doesn't matter\" to just always treat things lowercase (removes case-insensitive searching which is slower), and extra values don't store an additional full entry. The order of values for a specific name are preserved, since the spec points out that is required, but otherwise hashing can alter the order of different names.\r\n- We originally made the `HeaderCaseMap` as something that curl could use to preserve the casing of the names. There have been desires for such a thing in the Rust API, and in fact some tiny portions of it are already exposed and depended on. So, we can't really change its behavior...\r\n- It feels bad to have a 3rd collection that just stores the full order of the values.\r\n\r\nI still don't know what the best answer here is.","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hyperium/hyper/issues/comments/1079506518/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"seanmonstar","id":51479,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxNDc5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/51479?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar","html_url":"https://github.com/seanmonstar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hyperium/hyper/issues/comments/1082481854","html_url":"https://github.com/hyperium/hyper/issues/2780#issuecomment-1082481854","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hyperium/hyper/issues/2780","id":1082481854,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAWaYQc5AhVy-","user":{"login":"liamwarfield","id":32559457,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyNTU5NDU3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/32559457?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/liamwarfield","html_url":"https://github.com/liamwarfield","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liamwarfield/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liamwarfield/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liamwarfield/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liamwarfield/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liamwarfield/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liamwarfield/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liamwarfield/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liamwarfield/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liamwarfield/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-03-30T00:03:54Z","updated_at":"2022-03-30T00:03:54Z","body":"Thanks for the update (\"The order of values for a specific name are preserved\" was very helpful) .
