It seems there was already a good amount of discussion around this in #1174, but I'm not sure what the conclusion was. \r\n\r\nIt seems like there are three options:\r\n1. Implement custom connector with `Connect` instead of HttpConnector\r\n2. Add resolver type to HttpConnector (#1174)\r\n3. Modifying tokio's `ClientProto`(?). I admit I'm not sure what this actually means for end-users.\r\n\r\nHonestly I think 2) makes a lot of sense because we get to avoid any duplication and maintenance efforts to keep a custom connector up-to-date / bug-free with HttpConnector. But again, I'm not sure if 3) is better?\r\n\r\nContext for this is: we're trying to update from an old fork of hyper and had previously swapped out the resolver in the fork :). \r\n\r\n@seanmonstar thoughts?\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"seanmonstar","id":51479,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxNDc5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/51479?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar","html_url":"https://github.com/seanmonstar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hyperium/hyper/issues/1517/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":1,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hyperium/hyper/issues/1517/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
