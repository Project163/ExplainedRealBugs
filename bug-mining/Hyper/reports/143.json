This includes the following violations:\r\n\r\n - Hyper server sets the response version to `HTTP/1.1` even for `HTTP/1.0` requests\r\n - Hyper server will enter into keep-alive mode without sending `Connection: keep-alive` to the client\r\n - Hyper server will use `Transfer-Encoding: chunked` regardless of client version\r\n\r\nAll of these items violate backwards compatilbility. An HTTP/1.1 server should be backwards compatible. Failing that I suggest that Hyper instead drops the connection, but I hope backwards compatibility could be achieved without too much trouble.\r\n\r\nFor keep-alive: HTTP/1.0 has support for parts of the keep-alive functionality, but for backwards compatibility it is sufficient to completely disable it when the request is of version 1.0.\r\n\r\nFor chunked transfer encoding: This is fundamentally not available in HTTP/1.0. However, streaming responses are possible by sending the body directly and terminating the TCP connection when completed. (This is a hopeless design, which is how we came to HTTP/1.1 in the first place)\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nDo we still need HTTP/1.0 compatibility? I stumbled onto this problem when benchmarking my server with apachebench, which only supports HTTP/1.0. Nginx also surprisingly defaults to using version 1.0 when talking to backend servers as a reverse proxy, though it can be configured to use HTTP/1.1 (and maybe even 2 these days?)\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nAre there workarounds? It is possible to run the server behind a reverse proxy that is correctly backwards compatible with clients, but still uses HTTP/1.1 to communicate with the backends. Nginx is an example of this.
