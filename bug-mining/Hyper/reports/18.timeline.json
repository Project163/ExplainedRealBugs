I just got it running. However, I found `runtime` feature is not additive.\r\nSince I'm not using tokio, with `runtime` feature enabled may cause a panic when shuting dow.\r\n\r\nI can simply not enable `runtime` feature, but other crates like `reqwest` enables it and breaks my code.\r\n\r\n<details><summary>backtrace</summary>\r\n\r\n```log\r\nJul 12 01:06:13.296 ERROR main panic: thread 'main' panicked at 'there is
