That was to unblock #2839, since we wanted to use the name for the trait instead. But, the name should be properly considered.\r\n\r\nThe purpose of this type is: an implementation of `Body` to represent bodies received from a remote. So, the client side would see this in the `Response`, and the server side would see this in the `Request`. It is **not** meant to be constructed by users as a \"default\" implementation.\r\n\r\nSome names I've seen or considered before:\r\n\r\n- `Recv`\r\n- `RecvStream`/`RecvBody`\r\n- `Streaming`\r\n- `Incoming`\r\n- `Remote`\r\n- `Wire`/`FromWire`\r\n\r\nIt might help to envision the type signature users will frequently see it as, such as `Request<Streaming>` (or insert any other name in there).","closed_by":{"login":"seanmonstar","id":51479,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxNDc5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/51479?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar","html_url":"https://github.com/seanmonstar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hyperium/hyper/issues/2971/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hyperium/hyper/issues/2971/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
