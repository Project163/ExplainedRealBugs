In my case, I need to buffer the output of an egress `HttpBody` implementation until a few MBs, and then I pass that big buffer to Hyper to write it over a h1 stream. When I pass it, Hyper is using the flatten strategy, so [it ends up copying the entire big buffer again](https://github.com/hyperium/hyper/blob/b5022f3854d1f9ed3e76233dd63f319efc3b8f47/src/proto/h1/io.rs#L548).\r\n\r\nI'll make a PR to restore the builder setter to force queue strategy.","closed_by":{"login":"seanmonstar","id":51479,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxNDc5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/51479?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar","html_url":"https://github.com/seanmonstar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hyperium/hyper/issues/2676/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hyperium/hyper/issues/2676/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
