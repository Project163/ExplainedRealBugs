proposes a way to offer an easier way to manage HTTP upgrades than using the lower-level `client::conn` and `server::conn` APIs. This includes both `Upgrade` + `101 Switching Protocols`, and `CONNECT` tunneling.\r\n\r\n# `Body::on_upgrade`\r\n\r\nIt makes use of the `Body` type that is returned by hyper. When the HTTP1 state machine notices an attempt to trigger an upgrade in either the client or the server, the returned `Body` will have some additional state to allow getting a `Future` of an eventual upgrade: `Body::on_upgrade(self) -> impl Future`.\r\n\r\nThis `on_upgrade` future, if successful, will return a new `hyper::upgrade::Upgraded` type that fully owns the original IO transport, after the upgrade. The `Upgraded` can itself be used as an `AsyncRead`/`AsyncWrite` for convenience (and automatically including any buffered bytes as part of the `read`s). However, if desired, you can also try to deconstruct/downcast from an `Upgraded` into `hyper::upgrade::Parts<T>`.\r\n\r\n## `hyper::upgrade::Upgraded`\r\n\r\nAn added benefit to this API is that it allows adding support for `CONNECT` over HTTP2 without breaking backwards compatibility. The tricky part there normally is that `CONNECT` in HTTP2 doesn't actually take control of the IO transport, but instead continues to send `DATA` frames over the h2 stream. So, once the `h2` library adds support, hyper can encapsulate that support in a private `impl AsyncRead + AsyncWrite` implementation, and still just return an `Upgraded`.\r\n\r\nA **papercut** in the proposal is that `Upgraded` needs to put the IO in a trait object that can be put `Body`, which is `Send`. There was a missing `I: Send` bounds on `server::conn::Connection`, which makes it impossible to use this new API when using the lower-level `Http::server_connection`. The proposed solution is to add `Connection::with_upgrades()` that converts into a type that does have a `Send` bound, and allows using this API.\r\n\r\nAny usage of `serve_connection` that forgets to add `with_upgrades` will not have upgrades work. The `on_upgrade` future will yield an `Error`. This error however, does include specific messaging when an upgrade was expected to work, but couldn't because of use of lower-level APIs. Additionally, this means that manual upgrades with the lower-level APIs still work correctly.\r\n\r\n# TODO\r\n\r\n- [x] Implement the feature\r\n- [x] Write tests\r\n- [x] Include an example in the examples directory of both client and server usage.\r\n- [x] Document the `hyper::upgrade` module.\r\n- [x] Document the `server::conn::Connection::with_upgrades` method.\r\n- [x] Investigate performance implications of adding upgrade machinery.\r\n- [x] Consider if messaging needs improving for anyone doing manual upgrades.\r\n\r\nCloses #1395
