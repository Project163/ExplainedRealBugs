I was wondering it might be possible to add a method to allow for this.\r\n\r\n_Note: I might totally have missed it if there's already a method that allows for this. Apologies if any of this is redundant!_\r\n\r\n## Motivation\r\nSystemd has the capability of creating sockets and handing them off to applications using the `$LISTEN_FD` env var. Crates such as [listenfd](https://github.com/mitsuhiko/rust-listenfd) and [systemfd](https://github.com/mitsuhiko/systemfd) make clever use of this to provide an uninterrupted reload experience during development.\r\n\r\nAs part of the CLI WG we've written [clap-port-flag](https://github.com/rust-clique/clap-port-flag), which can create a socket from `--port`, `$PORT`, or `$LISTEN_FD`. It does this by exposing a `.bind()` method that contains all logic necessary to do this.\r\n\r\n```rust\r\nfn main() {\r\n  let args = Cli::from_args();\r\n  let _tcp_listener = args.port.bind().unwrap();\r\n}\r\n```\r\nIn order for Systemd's `$LISTEN_FD` to work with Hyper, a method would be needed to pass in a `TcpListener` instance.\r\n\r\n## Prior Art\r\n`actix-web` has a [`server.listen()`](https://docs.rs/actix-web/0.6.11/actix_web/server/struct.HttpServer.html#method.listen) method that takes a `TcpListener`. It also exposes a `server.bind()` method which acts similar to Hyper's `.bind()` method.\r\n\r\n## Implementation\r\nI propose adding a `hyper::server::Server::listen()` method with the following signature:\r\n```rust\r\npub fn listen(listener: &TcpListener) -> Builder<AddrIncoming>\r\n```\r\n_Note: To be honest I'm not completely sure if `Builder<AddrIncoming>` would be the right return type here. I hope it is!_\r\n\r\n## Other Considerations\r\nIt looks like `actix-web` also exposes a [`.listen_tls()`](https://docs.rs/actix-web/0.6.11/actix_web/server/struct.HttpServer.html#method.listen_tls) method which also accepts a TLS struct. I'm not sure what the interactions between TLS and external `TcpListener` initialization would be in Hyper.\r\n\r\n## References\r\n- https://github.com/mitsuhiko/rust-listenfd\r\n- https://github.com/rust-clique/clap-port-flag (maintained by yours truly)\r\n- https://github.com/mitsuhiko/systemfd\r\n- https://twitter.com/mitsuhiko/status/997227876327002112\r\n- https://github.com/passcod/catflap\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThanks so much for your time; I hope this is useful!","closed_by":{"login":"seanmonstar","id":51479,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxNDc5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/51479?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar","html_url":"https://github.com/seanmonstar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hyperium/hyper/issues/1602/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hyperium/hyper/issues/1602/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
