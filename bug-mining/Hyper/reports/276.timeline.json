@seanmonstar, I think I'd like to work on this next.\r\n\r\nHowever, I need a few additional pointers before I can start:\r\n- Do we want to split only the `Connection` type, or all/most of the types in the `server::conn`? Is it just that we want to start simple, as the same argument can be made for the rest of the file?\r\n- There will be some code duplication. Are we okay with that, or should we abstract to some common free functions?\r\n- There are methods that require both `http1` and `http2` features, like `upgrade_h2`. Just to sanity check, that would be a method in `http1::Connection` that would still require both features enabled, take `self` by value and return `http2::Connection`.\r\n\r\nI'd ask you for clarifications, confirmation that we still want to work on this, and maybe some new thoughts that you had about the

this is something that still needs to be done.\r\n\r\n> Do we want to split only the Connection type, or all/most of the types in the server::conn?\r\n\r\nLemme take a look... I think that the types currently in `server::conn` should be remove from the public API. `Connection` should exist in both. So should a builder. The `Addr*` types are gone already. The `Connecting` should be gone as well, if not already.\r\n\r\n> Duplication ... should we abstract to some common free functions?\r\n\r\nSome duplication is fine. It's also fine to refactor to some free functions in `server::conn`, as long as they stay private.
