It's true, hyper does ignore some things about how to deal with HTTP/1.0 peers. It would be nice to fix them.\r\n\r\n> Do we still need HTTP/1.0 compatibility?\r\n\r\nI have wondered the same. I also haven't actually run into an HTTP/1.0 server or client myself.\r\n\r\nSome support already exists, and it seems like a good idea to add the rest.\r\n\r\n- Keep-Alive: I had actually thought that this part at least was implemented correctly for 1.0 and 1.1. If a server sees a client talking 1.0, it won't assume keep-alive unless the client sent `Connection: keep-alive`. What part is incorrect?\r\n- Responding with the correct version would be a good, not too complicated, fix.\r\n- Checking the peer version and disabled chunked would be good too. I haven't read how 1.0 is supposed to handle messages without a length. Is it simply either `Content-Length`, or until EOF and thus keep-alive is disabled?","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hyperium/hyper/issues/comments/327602335/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"seanmonstar","id":51479,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxNDc5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/51479?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar","html_url":"https://github.com/seanmonstar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hyperium/hyper/issues/comments/328065955","html_url":"https://github.com/hyperium/hyper/issues/1304#issuecomment-328065955","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hyperium/hyper/issues/1304","id":328065955,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMyODA2NTk1NQ==","user":{"login":"maghoff","id":386371,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4NjM3MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/386371?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/maghoff","html_url":"https://github.com/maghoff","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maghoff/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maghoff/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maghoff/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maghoff/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maghoff/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maghoff/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maghoff/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maghoff/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maghoff/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-09-08T10:17:16Z","updated_at":"2017-09-08T10:20:05Z","body":"Thanks for getting back to me :) I'll try to clarify the rest:\r\n\r\n* `Connection` defaults to `close` in 1.0 and `keep-alive` in 1.1, so when the client requests `keep-alive`, the server has to include `Connection: keep-alive` in the response to verify support for this. (This is in contrast to 1.1, where both sides can assume `keep-alive` if nothing else is said) Hyper server is lacking this in the response. I haven't looked at the client, but I assume the converse error here? In any case, the correct behavior for the client is to ask for `keep-alive` and treat the connection mode as whatever the server responds, dependent on version:\r\n  * The server responds with HTTP/1.0 and no `Connection` header: Treat the connection as non-pipelined, as if the server had said `Connection: close`.\r\n  * The server responds with HTTP/1.1 (or 1.x, where x >= 1) and no `Connection` header: Treat the connection as pipelined, as if the server had said `Connection: keep-alive`.\r\n  * If the server response includes a `Connection` header, regardless of HTTP version, respect this header.\r\n\r\n\r\n* I think you have understood correctly how to treat messages without a declared `Content-Length` in 1.0. Either you have `Content-Length`, or the body is sent and terminated by closing the connection. This means that if the server is planning on replying without a set `Content-Length`, it _must_ avoid enabling `Connection: keep-alive`. This probably interacts with how a client would send the body in a POST or PUT request. Perhaps it is impossible to send a body without `Content-Length` to a 1.0 server? I'm not sure.
