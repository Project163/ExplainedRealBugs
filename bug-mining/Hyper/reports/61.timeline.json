currently researching technologies for some web app, and have wrote a simple http server as you show in your example:\n\n``` rust\nextern crate hyper;\n\nuse std::io::Write;\n\nuse hyper::Server;\nuse hyper::server::Request;\nuse hyper::server::Response;\nuse hyper::net::Fresh;\n\nfn hello(_: Request, res: Response<Fresh>) {\n    let mut res = res.start().unwrap();\n    res.write_all(b\"Hello World!\").unwrap();\n    res.end().unwrap();\n}\n\nfn main() {\n    Server::http(\"127.0.0.1:4000\").unwrap().handle(hello);\n}\n```\n\nThen I used JMeter for emulate some load, and thats what I've found, for example, in comparsion with Node.js:\n\n| Samples | Average | Median | 90% | 95% | 99% | Min | Max | Throughput /sec |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| hyper.rs | 2500 | 595 | 0 | 4 | 5619 | 10859 | 0 | 12387 |\n| node.js | 2500 | 2 | 2 | 6 | 7 | 9 | 0 | 30 |\n\n50'th and 90'th percentiles are very fast, and faster than node, but, then, 95 and higher - is much lower.\nIt means, that 95% of requests are faster than node, but 5% much slower.\n\nThen I've looked at detailed results of requests, and that is what I have found (more attention on the **Duration** column - it repeat high latency in period of ~50 requests):\n\n| Sample | Thread | Duration(ms) | Bytes | Latency |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1 | Pure hello 1-2 | 4 | 106 | 4 |\n| 2 | Pure
