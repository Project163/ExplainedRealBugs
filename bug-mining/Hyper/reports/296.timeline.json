And then the body can return that there was a NO_ERROR error. It should still be given to the user, so they know something happened.\r\n\r\nI don’t think it should be propagated at all:\r\nThe response body could be totally fine, there is no errors there, but `NO_ERROR` happened due to request body being dropped. It affects h2 stream status, but not the request result. So why we should to enrich the response body with the error? Only if something like “state” to check if there were underlying protocol errors, Idk\r\n\r\nThat’s actually legit scenario when body of request wasn’t consumed because server already responded back with valid response.And seems this behavior corresponds the H2 specification.\r\n\r\nThis is already long story, started here -  https://github.com/hyperium/h2/pull/600#issuecomment-1645579652, and then the behavior was changed [here](https://github.com/hyperium/h2/pull/634) (what is actually correct).

returns a single response, i.e. `rpc Method(stream Request) returns Response {}`. While streaming the request to the gRPC server the tonic client doesn't seem to react to an early response send by the server, only once the entire request is streamed is a response returned.\r\n\r\nSome more context: we're using a timeout for the request which triggered before all the request data was streamed. This in turn made the gRPC server return a timeout error as an early response.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hyperium/tonic/issues/846/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hyperium/tonic/issues/846/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"not_planned"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":9928089296,"node_id":"CE_lADOAWaYQc5Kg2xmzwAAAAJPwp7Q","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hyperium/hyper/issues/events/9928089296","actor":{"login":"seanmonstar","id":51479,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxNDc5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/51479?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar","html_url":"https://github.com/seanmonstar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2023-07-26T19:47:08Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":9928089722,"node_id":"REFE_lADOAWaYQc5Kg2xmzwAAAAJPwqB6","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hyperium/hyper/issues/events/9928089722","actor":{"login":"seanmonstar","id":51479,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxNDc5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/51479?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar","html_url":"https://github.com/seanmonstar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"194e6f984763f5dc1c376082170a85cc4db40ce4","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hyperium/hyper/commits/194e6f984763f5dc1c376082170a85cc4db40ce4","created_at":"2023-07-26T19:47:11Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":9928094531,"node_id":"REFE_lADOAWaYQc5Kg2xmzwAAAAJPwrND","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hyperium/hyper/issues/events/9928094531","actor":{"login":"seanmonstar","id":51479,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxNDc5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/51479?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar","html_url":"https://github.com/seanmonstar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"aac6760e032050dd47f5dbd32f852bf1ede9312b","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hyperium/hyper/commits/aac6760e032050dd47f5dbd32f852bf1ede9312b","created_at":"2023-07-26T19:47:47Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"actor":{"login":"slinkydeveloper","id":6706544,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY3MDY1NDQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6706544?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/slinkydeveloper","html_url":"https://github.com/slinkydeveloper","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slinkydeveloper/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slinkydeveloper/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slinkydeveloper/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slinkydeveloper/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/slinkydeveloper/subscriptions","

arm64\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Description**\r\nSilent failure on HTTP2 server reading request body when client sends `RST_STREAM(CANCEL)` on the stream containing request body. \r\n\r\nIn the example repro, the client is sending request body containing payload, followed by `RST_STREAM(CANCEL)` frame. Since the server is reading canceled stream, `request.body_mut().collect().await.unwrap().to_bytes()` is expected to trigger a panic via `unwrap()`. However, the function call returns the payload successfully without any indication of error. \r\n\r\nAfter digging through the PR history, the changes to ignore `CANCEL` and `NO_ERROR` code on `RST_STREAM` was introduced in https://github.com/hyperium/hyper/pull/3275 in response to issue https://github.com/hyperium/hyper/issues/2872. While this may be an expected behavior, is there a way to read stream more gracefully on the server such that the error on `RST_STREAM` is propagated?\r\n\r\n**Repro**\r\nhttps://github.com/sirahd/hyper-http2-rst-stream-cancel-repro\r\n\r\nserver code snippet:\r\n```rust\r\nuse std::convert::Infallible;\r\nuse std::future::Future;\r\nuse std::net::SocketAddr;\r\n\r\nuse http_body_util::BodyExt;\r\nuse http_body_util::Full;\r\nuse hyper::{Method, Request, Response};\r\nuse hyper::body::Bytes;\r\nuse hyper::rt::Executor;\r\nuse hyper::server::conn::http2;\r\nuse hyper::service::service_fn;\r\nuse hyper_util::rt::TokioIo;\r\nuse tokio::net::TcpListener;\r\n\r\nasync fn hello(mut request: Request<hyper::body::Incoming>) -> Result<Response<Full<Bytes>>, Infallible> {\r\n    println!(\"receiving request {:?}\", request);\r\n    match *request.method() {\r\n        Method::POST => {\r\n            let data = request.body_mut().collect().await.unwrap().to_bytes();\r\n            let transfer_bytes = data.len();\r\n\r\n            println!(\"{:?}\", transfer_bytes);\r\n            Ok(Response::new(Full::new(Bytes::from(transfer_bytes.to_string()))))\r\n        }\r\n        _ => Ok(Response::new(Full::new(Bytes::new())))\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\n#[tokio::main]\r\nasync fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error + Send + Sync>> {\r\n    let addr = SocketAddr::from(([127, 0, 0, 1], 4034));\r\n\r\n    let listener = TcpListener::bind(addr).await?;\r\n\r\n    loop {\r\n        let (stream, _) = listener.accept().await?;\r\n        let io = TokioIo::new(stream);\r\n\r\n        tokio::task::spawn(async move {\r\n            if let Err(err) = http2::Builder::new(TokioExecutor)\r\n                .serve_connection(io, service_fn(hello))\r\n                .await\r\n            {\r\n                eprintln!(\"Error serving connection: {:?}\", err);\r\n            }\r\n        });\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\n#[derive(Clone)]\r\nstruct TokioExecutor;\r\n\r\nimpl<F> Executor<F> for TokioExecutor\r\n    where\r\n        F: Future + Send + 'static,\r\n        F::Output: Send + 'static,\r\n{\r\n    fn execute(&self, future: F) {\r\n        tokio::spawn(future);\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\nclient code snippet:\r\n```rust\r\nuse std::error::Error;\r\nuse std::time::Duration;\r\n\r\nuse bytes::Bytes;\r\nuse h2::{client, Reason};\r\nuse http::{Method, Request};\r\nuse tokio::net::TcpStream;\r\n\r\n#[tokio::main]\r\nasync fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn Error>> {\r\n    let tcp = TcpStream::connect(\"127.0.0.1:4034\").await?;\r\n    let (h2, connection) = client::handshake(tcp).await?;\r\n    tokio::spawn(async move {\r\n        connection.await.unwrap();\r\n    });\r\n    let mut send_request = h2.ready().await?;\r\n\r\n    let request = Request::get(\"http://127.0.0.1:4034\")\r\n        .method(Method::POST)\r\n        .body(())\r\n        .unwrap();\r\n\r\n    let (response, mut send_stream) = send_request\r\n        .send_request(request, false).unwrap();\r\n\r\n    send_stream.send_data(Bytes::from(vec![5; 1000]), false)?;\r\n    tokio::time::sleep(Duration::from_secs(5)).await;\r\n    // sending RST_STREAM(CANCEL) here\r\n    send_stream.send_reset(Reason::CANCEL);\r\n    let response = response.await?;\r\n    println!(\"{:?}\", response);\r\n    Ok(())\r\n}\r\n```","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hyperium/hyper/issues/3681/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hyperium/hyper/issues/3681/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
