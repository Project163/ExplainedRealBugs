version: stable-2.8.1\r\n\r\n### Possible solution\r\nIt looks like a bug in [hyperium/hyper](https://github.com/hyperium/hyper)\r\n\r\n### Additional context\r\nWe are using [grpc-gateway](https://github.com/grpc-ecosystem/grpc-gateway) as a REST proxy for our GRPC services.\r\n\r\ngrpc-gateway is adding ```Grpc-Trailer-Content-Type: application/grpc``` trailer to the end of response body, then, linkerd2 proxy unable to read it correctly and request fails with ```net::ERR_INCOMPLETE_CHUNKED_ENCODING``` in Google Chrome browser.\r\n\r\nAccording to example on [this](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Trailer) page - http response from a server is absolutely legitimate.\r\n\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/linkerd/linkerd2/issues/4714/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/linkerd/linkerd2/issues/4714/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"actor":{"login":"strobil","id":6442572,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0NDI1NzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6442572?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/strobil","html_url":"https://github.com/strobil","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/strobil/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/strobil/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/strobil/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/strobil/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/strobil/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/strobil/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/strobil/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/strobil/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/strobil/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-07-03T13:16:20Z","updated_at":"2020-07-03T13:16:20Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/grpc-ecosystem/grpc-gateway/issues/1499","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/grpc-ecosystem/grpc-gateway","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/grpc-ecosystem/grpc-gateway/issues/1499/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/grpc-ecosystem/grpc-gateway/issues/1499/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/grpc-ecosystem/grpc-gateway/issues/1499/events","html_url":"https://github.com/grpc-ecosystem/grpc-gateway/pull/1499","id":650591324,"node_id":"MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0NDQ0MDUzMzY2","number":1499,"title":"forward
