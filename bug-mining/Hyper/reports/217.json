Because `hyper::Body` doesn't implement `AsyncRead` I've instead standardized around a `Stream<Item = impl BodyChunk>` API where `BodyChunk` covers two operations: splitting and dereffing to `&[u8]`. My final constraint is that I want to be able to return the same `impl BodyChunk` type, mostly to make it easy to drop `multipart-async` into existing request handlers.\r\n\r\nWithout implementing `BodyChunk` specifically for `hyper::Chunk` while still having an applicable impl for it, I would need an impl that's generic over `T: From<Bytes>, Bytes: From<T>, T: AsRef<[u8]>`. My hangup on this is that I now cannot implement `BodyChunk` for `&[u8]` directly, which complicates testing as I have to convert all bytestring literals to `Bytes`. (I also want to avoid a generic impl based on `Into<Bytes>` as that operation may perform implicit copies and I'm trying to be near-zero-copy.)\r\n\r\nI realize `Chunk` exists because it used to be a custom implementation of `Bytes` but at this point it can be changed to just be a type alias and basically nothing will break (except usages of `Chunk::into_bytes()`, ironically).","closed_by":{"login":"seanmonstar","id":51479,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxNDc5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/51479?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar","html_url":"https://github.com/seanmonstar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hyperium/hyper/issues/1931/reactions","total_count":3,"+1":3,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hyperium/hyper/issues/1931/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
