I think the easiest way is to let `Server` take multiple `Accept`s of the same type e.g (but with more traits so you could pass a bare HttpListener as before).\n\n``` rust\nimpl<I> Server<I> where I: IntoIterator, I::Item: Accept, <I::Item as Accept>::Output: Transport {\n    ...\n}\n```\n\nThen you could have something like this in a different crate.\n\n``` rust\nenum HttpOrHttpsListener {\n    Http(HttpListener),\n    Https(HttpsListener),\n}\n\nimpl Accept for HttpOrHttpsListener {\n    ...\n}\n```\n","closed_by":{"login":"seanmonstar","id":51479,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxNDc5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/51479?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar","html_url":"https://github.com/seanmonstar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hyperium/hyper/issues/859/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hyperium/hyper/issues/859/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
