implements `From<Message> for Request` and `Into<Message> for\r\nResponse`, allowing an `Http` instance to be used with a `TcpServer`\r\nfrom tokio-proto.\r\n\r\nCloses #1036\r\n\r\nBREAKING CHANGE: This makes `Request.remote_addr` an\r\n  `Option<SocketAddr>`, instead of `SocketAddr`.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\n@alexcrichton This would make hyper's `Http` compatible with `TcpServer`. Requiring a secondary trait to be able to get a `SocketAddr` felt like more of a pain, so instead I've settled on allowing the address to be an `Option`. Does it seem like `TcpServer` could gain the ability to collect the `SocketAddr` later, such as for 0.2, and we can make use of it then? If so, I can file a tracking bug.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hyperium/hyper/issues/1047/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hyperium/hyper/issues/1047/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":966133439,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDk2NjEzMzQzOQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hyperium/hyper/issues/events/966133439","actor":{"login":"seanmonstar","id":51479,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxNDc5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/51479?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar","html_url":"https://github.com/seanmonstar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"e04bcc12a7e081f75482cdca1e4f4c4f597ad2ce","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hyperium/hyper/commits/e04bcc12a7e081f75482cdca1e4f4c4f597ad2ce","created_at":"2017-02-17T02:26:45Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":967402062,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50OTY3NDAyMDYy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hyperium/hyper/issues/events/967402062","actor":{"login":"seanmonstar","id":51479,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxNDc5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/51479?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar","html_url":"https://github.com/seanmonstar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2017-02-17T18:49:29Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
