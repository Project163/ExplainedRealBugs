 ## Overview
 
-hyper is a fast, modern HTTP implementation written in and for Rust. It
-is a low-level typesafe abstraction over raw HTTP, providing an elegant
-layer over "stringly-typed" HTTP.
+hyper is a fast, safe HTTP implementation written in and for Rust.
 
 hyper offers both an HTTP client and server which can be used to drive
 complex web applications written entirely in Rust.
 
-hyper makes use of "async IO" (non-blocking sockets) via the [Tokio](https://tokio.rs) and [Futures](https://docs.rs/futures) libraries.

 Be aware that hyper is still actively evolving towards 1.0, and is likely
-to experience breaking changes before stabilising. You can also see the [1.0 issue milestone](https://github.com/hyperium/hyper/milestone/1).
