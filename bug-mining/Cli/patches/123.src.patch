-CLI 1.1 is a bugfix release of CLI. The following changes notable API changes were made: 
+Commons CLI 1.2 is a bugfix release. The following notable changes were made:
 
- * The Parser abstract class has two additional parse methods that take a Properties parameter. 
- * The HelpFormatter class had publicly accessible fields. These should now be accessed via get/set methods and the public fields are deprecated. 
- * The Option class addValue(String) method now throws UnsupportedOperationException. 
- * OptionValidator is a newly added class. 
- * Option's now have equals(Object) and hashCode() methods. 
- * The Option class also received two new methods, setDescription(String) and hasValueSeparator();boolean. 
+ * A major regression introduced in CLI 1.1 that prevented the usage of repeated options has been fixed.
+ * Several parser issues have been fixed, especially with the PosixParser.
+ * HelpFormatter now wraps the lines properly
+ * The ordering of the option in the help message can now be defined.
+ * Various API enhancements (improved exceptions, serializable classes)
 
-The jar should be API backwards compatible, though if you were calling addValue(String) then you won't be happy. Please let us know your use case if that is so. 
+Commons CLI 1.2 is binary compatible with the previous versions, except for
+the OptionValidator class that is no longer public.

 NEW FEATURES:
 
-  CLI-78 - Setting description of a Option. 
+  * The method getOptionProperties() in the CommandLine class was added
+    to retrieve easily the key/value pairs specified with options like
+    -Dkey1=value1 -Dkey2=value2.
+
+  * GnuParser now supports long options with an '=' sign
+    (ie. --foo=bar and -foo=bar) (CLI-157)
+
+  * The ordering of options can be defined in help messages. (CLI-155)
