pull request adds support for deeper type inspections to allow for strong type guarantees and more type-based generation and features. The current PR is roughly feature parity and does not add more features -- the exception is adding generics to types when found (NOT when found on classes to generate). \r\n\r\nThe following changes were made: \r\n\r\n* Utilized Guava's `TypeToken<>` to fully introspect the classes being loaded and utilize this information to do better generation\r\n* Added consistent ordering to properties based on the property name then the original member\r\n* Cleaned up some unneeded code after the switch\r\n* Added consistent \"empty line\" spacing -- there is no spaces on empty lines after generation\r\n* Added more predicate prefixes\r\n* Replaced usages of `line.separator` with `\\n` because it causes issues on windows vs. unix\r\n* Updated tests to match any changes made\r\n\r\nI'm looking for insight into what should be done to have this merge, or if it's even wanted. 😄 \r\n\r\nThis closes #92. This also adds the required information to solve #57, and #51, I think.
