However, in the generic case we can't assume that `getData()` simply returns `data`.\n\nThe problem in my case is that I have is that I am trying to use the generator on a (rather large) third-party code base (which is what has uncovered some of these esoteric issues). If it were my own code I would simply modify it so that the conflict didn't exist. And I assume that if I am having this problem other potential users of the generator may be as well.\n\nGiven that I don't know whether the field and the getter serve the same function or if they have different purposes, I thought it best to leave power in the hands of the test developer to choose which they wish to run their assertions against by providing separate assertion methods for each.\n\nHowever, I also acknowledge that this introduces complications and is not a very common case (even in the code I'm working on it only happens once), so perhaps simply omitting the field assertion is the best solution for now as it avoids unnecessarily complicating the code. If a good case for my solution can be made it won't be difficult to add it in the future.\n\nI'll change my patch per your suggestion.\n","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj-generator/issues/comments/73994562/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"kriegfrj","id":7224087,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcyMjQwODc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7224087?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kriegfrj","html_url":"https://github.com/kriegfrj","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kriegfrj/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kriegfrj/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kriegfrj/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kriegfrj/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kriegfrj/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kriegfrj/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kriegfrj/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kriegfrj/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kriegfrj/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":236267114,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDIzNjI2NzExNA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj-generator/issues/events/236267114","actor":{"login":"kriegfrj","id":7224087,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcyMjQwODc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7224087?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kriegfrj","html_url":"https://github.com/kriegfrj","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kriegfrj/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kriegfrj/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kriegfrj/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kriegfrj/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kriegfrj/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kriegfrj/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kriegfrj/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kriegfrj/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kriegfrj/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"31727a220ec6e55f29850e5117163f3b287924fd","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kriegfrj/assertj-assertions-generator/commits/31727a220ec6e55f29850e5117163f3b287924fd","created_at":"2015-02-16T11:46:52Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"actor":{"login":"kriegfrj","id":7224087,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcyMjQwODc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7224087?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kriegfrj","html_url":"https://github.com/kriegfrj","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kriegfrj/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kriegfrj/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kriegfrj/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kriegfrj/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kriegfrj/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kriegfrj/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kriegfrj/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kriegfrj/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kriegfrj/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-02-16T11:49:31Z","updated_at":"2015-02-16T11:49:31Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj-generator/issues/42","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj-generator","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj-generator/issues/42/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj-generator/issues/42/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj-generator/issues/42/events","html_url":"https://github.com/assertj/assertj-generator/pull/42","id":57795096,"node_id":"MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0MjkzNjczOTQ=","number":42,"title":"Skip
