It would be nice to be able to rename the generated endpoint to reflect the fact that it's a mixin interface rather than a class with static methods.\n","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj-generator/issues/comments/214235489/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"aro-tech","id":16776209,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2Nzc2MjA5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16776209?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aro-tech","html_url":"https://github.com/aro-tech","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aro-tech/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aro-tech/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aro-tech/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aro-tech/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aro-tech/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aro-tech/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aro-tech/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aro-tech/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aro-tech/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":675893699,"node_id":"MDE1Ok1pbGVzdG9uZWRFdmVudDY3NTg5MzY5OQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj-generator/issues/events/675893699","actor":{"login":"joel-costigliola","id":382613,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4MjYxMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/382613?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola","html_url":"https://github.com/joel-costigliola","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"milestoned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2016-05-30T10:24:46Z","milestone":{"title":"2.1.0"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":675893788,"node_id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDY3NTg5Mzc4OA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj-generator/issues/events/675893788","actor":{"login":"joel-costigliola","id":382613,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4MjYxMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/382613?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola","html_url":"https://github.com/joel-costigliola","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2016-05-30T10:24:50Z","label":{"name":"enhancement","color":"84b6eb"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":717761577,"node_id":"MDE3OlJlbmFtZWRUaXRsZUV2ZW50NzE3NzYxNTc3","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj-generator/issues/events/717761577","actor":{"login":"joel-costigliola","id":382613,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4MjYxMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/382613?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola","html_url":"https://github.com/joel-costigliola","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/events{/privacy}","received_eve
