duplicate  this issue : https://github.com/joel-costigliola/assertj-assertions-generator-maven-plugin/issues/19 because the issue is on this project and not in the maven-plugin.\n\nThe problem is when you have some classes with same name but a differents references (packages), *Assertions.java didn't compile (due to some collisions)\n\nMoreover, there is only one assertThat method created. \n\nMaybe one fix could be to remove imports and always use the fully qualifier name, but it's a huge change for this project.\n\n_To reproduce this issue, you can copy a class into another package and try to generate assertions for both, *Assertions.java files will not compile._\n","closed_by":{"login":"joel-costigliola","id":382613,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4MjYxMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/382613?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola","html_url":"https://github.com/joel-costigliola","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj-generator/issues/28/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj-generator/issues/28/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
