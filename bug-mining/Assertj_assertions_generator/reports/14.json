the time being, inheritance is taken into account at generation time as assertions for inherited properties are generated.\n\nif you have a `Person` with a name and an `Employee` inheriting from `Person` with a company property then, the generator will create the following assertions : \n- `hasName in`PersonAssert` \n- `hasName in`EmployeeAssert`\n- `hasCompany` in `EmployeeAssert` \n\nThe idea here would be to generate only `hasName` in `Person` and set `EmployeeAssert` to inherit from `PersonAssert`.\n\nThe advantage would be that any modification in `PersonAssert` to be reflected to `EmployeeAssert` (for example if you had a new assertion that was not generated).\n\nWe might set a flag to choose between generating assertions for inherited properties or generating an hierarchy of assertions class.\n","closed_by":{"login":"joel-costigliola","id":382613,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4MjYxMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/382613?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola","html_url":"https://github.com/joel-costigliola","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj-generator/issues/2/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj-generator/issues/2/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
