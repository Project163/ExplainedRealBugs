At present the generator will generate an assertion method `hasData(...)` for both, which at best is confusing and at worst produces a compile error (if they both have the same type).\n\nI have run into a real-world example of this which produced a compiler error. Arguably it is not best coding practice, however I believe that we could (and should) handle it more gracefully.\n\nI thought of submitting a patch which renames the field assertion to (eg) `hasDataField()` in the case that it finds a clash. That fixes my immediate problem, however it is imperfect as it introduces other theoretical clash possibilities (eg, if you also had a method called `getDataField()`). I'm open to other suggestions.\n","closed_by":{"login":"joel-costigliola","id":382613,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4MjYxMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/382613?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola","html_url":"https://github.com/joel-costigliola","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj-generator/issues/39/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj-generator/issues/39/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
