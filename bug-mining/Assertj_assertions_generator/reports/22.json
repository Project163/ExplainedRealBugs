will have a lot of benefits: \n- avoid errors when two classes with the same name (but different package) are used\n- simplify code\n- avoid unused imports\n\nUnused imports happened when generating assertions for a `Collection` property or `Map`.\n\nEx : \n\n``` java\npublic interface AttributeValuesGetter {\n    public java.util.Map<test.AttributeSchema, java.util.Collection<test.AttributeValue>> getAttributeValuesMap();\n}\n```\n\nWe should probably try to detect any unused import at the latest step of assertion class
