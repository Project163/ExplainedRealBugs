The background is the Kubernetes model is very deeply nested. \n\nFor a complex model where you want to write assertions like:\n\n```\nassertThat(foo.getBar().getThing()).isNotNull()\n```\n\nthe problem is the getBar() could return null as could the getThing(). \n\nSo we wanna do this instead...\n\n```\nassertThat(foo).bar().thing().isNotNull();\n```\n\nwhere each property method `bar()` and `thing()` are kinda like the `hasBar()` function thats generated OOTB, only it returns the assertThat() of the value. So the last assertion - `.isNotNull()` could be anything really; `isEqualTo()` or whatever.\n\ne.g. we generate functions like this:\n\n```\nclass FooAssert ... {\n\n   public BarAssert bar() {\n      isNotNull();\n\n      return (BarAssert) assertThat(actual.getBar()).describedAs(toString() + \".bar\");\n  }\n}\n```\n\nI've managed to implement the above in our project using the extensible templates (thanks for that!) - but to do so I needed to add the above 2 properties to the templates. Actually as of writing only the 2nd one is required but figured I may as well submit a PR for both ;)\n","closed_by":{"login":"joel-costigliola","id":382613,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4MjYxMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/382613?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola","html_url":"https://github.com/joel-costigliola","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj-generator/issues/67/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj-generator/issues/67/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
