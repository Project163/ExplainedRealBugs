@joel-costigliola I've just made another patch to the PR to also add `${elementAssertType}` as an expression value so that we can generate navigation based List assert methods.\n\ne.g. here's my current version of \n\n```\n            <iterableAssertion>has_elements_assertion_template_for_iterable.txt</iterableAssertion>\n```\n\nwhich is:\n\n``` java\n\n  /**\n   * Navigates to the property ${property} so that assertions can be done on it\n   */\n  public NavigationListAssert<${elementType}, ${elementAssertType}> ${property_safe}() ${throws} {\n    isNotNull();\n\n    // return the assertion for the property\n    AssertFactory<${elementType}, ${elementAssertType}> assertFactory = new AssertFactory<${elementType}, ${elementAssertType}>() {\n      public ${elementAssertType} createAssert(${elementType} t) {\n        return (${elementAssertType}) assertThat(t);\n      }\n    };\n    NavigationListAssert<${elementType}, ${elementAssertType}> answer = new NavigationListAssert<${elementType}, ${elementAssertType}>(actual.get${Property}(), assertFactory);\n    answer.describedAs(io.fabric8.kubernetes.assertions.Assertions.joinDescription(this, \"${property}\"));\n    return answer;\n  }\n\n```\n\nwhich is used to generate the `items()` method in the above test case. The generated code is:\n\n``` java\n  /**\n   * Navigates to the property items so that assertions can be done on it\n   */\n  public NavigationListAssert<Pod, PodAssert> items()  {\n    isNotNull();\n\n    // return the assertion for the property\n    AssertFactory<Pod, PodAssert> assertFactory = new AssertFactory<Pod, PodAssert>() {\n      public PodAssert createAssert(Pod t) {\n        return (PodAssert) assertThat(t);\n      }\n    };\n    NavigationListAssert<Pod, PodAssert> answer = new NavigationListAssert<Pod, PodAssert>(actual.getItems(), assertFactory);\n    answer.describedAs(io.fabric8.kubernetes.assertions.Assertions.joinDescription(this, \"items\"));\n    return answer;\n  }\n```\n\nFor now I've added classes `NavigationListAssert`, `AssertFactory` and helper method `io.fabric8.kubernetes.assertions.Assertions.joinDescription()` to my project; I'm about to raise a PR against assertj-core to add those classes into the core library; so folks can use a version of the above template to get navigation based lists in their generated assert classes.\n\nIncidentally whats nice about `NavigationListAssert` (which extends `ListAssert<T>`) is its got all the previously generated methods as before all in a single wrapper class so we generate only 1 method for a list property rather than 4  or 5; plus we add `first()`, `last()`, `item(index)` methods too along with all the methods from `ListAssert` being available too.\n","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj-generator/issues/comments/208763198/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"jstrachan","id":30140,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwMTQw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/30140?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jstrachan","html_url":"https://github.com/jstrachan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jstrachan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jstrachan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jstrachan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jstrachan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jstrachan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jstrachan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jstrachan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jstrachan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jstrachan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":623701049,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50NjIzNzAxMDQ5","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj-generator/issues/events/623701049","actor":{"login":"PascalSchumacher","id":2707245,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3MDcyNDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2707245?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/PascalSchumacher","html_url":"https://github.com/PascalSchumacher","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PascalSchumacher/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PascalSchumacher/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PascalSchumacher/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PascalSchumacher/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PascalSchumacher/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PascalSchumacher/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PascalSchumacher/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PascalSchumacher/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PascalSchumacher/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2016-04-12T07:51:45Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":623701050,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDYyMzcwMTA1MA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj-generator/issues/events/623701050","actor":{"login":"PascalSchumacher","id":2707245,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3MDcyNDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2707245?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/PascalSchumacher","html_url":"https://github.com/PascalSchumacher","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PascalSchumacher/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PascalSchumacher/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PascalSchumacher/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PascalSchumacher/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PascalSchumacher/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PascalSchumacher/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PascalSchumacher/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PascalSchumacher/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PascalSchumacher/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2016-04-12T07:51:45Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":623701051,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50NjIzNzAxMDUx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj-generator/issues/events/623701051","actor":{"login":"joel-costigliola","id":382613,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4MjYxMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/382613?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola","html_url":"https://github.com/joel-costigliola","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/received_events

code or enter the debugger to figure out what was null! :)

this PR is merged and issue fixed https://github.com/joel-costigliola/assertj-assertions-generator/issues/67 along with the NavigationListAssert class in assertj-core: https://github.com/joel-costigliola/assertj-core/issues/641 it would be easy to switch the OOTB templates in the generator to use the 'navigation' model approach. \n\nSo that for every property of an object we generate exactly one navigation method that lets users chain assertions together; reusing all the methods from ListAssert and NavigationListAssert for iterable properties or the custom typed assertions for other properties. \n\nThis would result in much smaller code generated for the assertion classes and much more power. The only downside is some of the current methods would be a tad more verbose. \n\ne.g. for a generated assertion class with a name property the current generated code would be:\n\n``` java\n// current generated code\nassertThat(person).hasName(\"James\");\n\n// new minimal code\nassertThat(person).name().isEqualTo(\"James\");\nassertThat(person).name().contains(\"m\");\n...\n```\n\nDitto for iterable properties right now we generate a few methods which are mostly already included in ListAssert. e.g. all these assertion methods are available on any generated iterable property method:\nhttps://github.com/jstrachan/assertj-core/blob/7b1d079edeb5ac984cebbed77a65025718ee7673/src/test/java/org/assertj/core/navigation/ListNavigation_Test.java#L56-L62\n\nRemoving the old generated methods would break folks code I guess; so maybe we should add a flag to switch to the new more concise model?\n\nIf you are interested; here are the 2 new templates (which need minor tweaks to reuse the https://github.com/joel-costigliola/assertj-core/issues/641 code):\n- for general properties/fields:

imagine you've some generated assertion classes which are deeply nested like discussed [here](https://github.com/joel-costigliola/assertj-assertions-generator/issues/67) so you have some assertions like...\n\n``` java\nassertThat(foo).bar().whatnot().cheese().isNotNull(); \nassertThat(foo).bar().whatnot().beer().isEqualTo(\"Stella\");\nassertThat(foo).bar().whatnot().wine().isEqualTo(\"Shiraz\");\n```\n\nthere's some duplication. Now our IDEs can refactor those expressions to variables...\n\n``` java\nWhatnotAssert whatnot = assertThat(foo).bar().whatnot();\nwhatnot.cheese().isNotNull(); \nwhatnot.beer().isEqualTo(\"Stella\");\nwhatnot.wine().isEqualTo(\"Shiraz\");\n```\n\nbut I wonder if Java 8 lambdas could be used to make an XPath like variable/predicate chain via a single new method on AbstractAssert?\n\n``` java\nassertThat(foo).bar().whatnot().with(whatnot -> {\n  whatnot.cheese().isNotNull(); \n  whatnot.beer().isEqualTo(\"Stella\");\n  whatnot.wine().isEqualTo(\"Shiraz\");\n});\n```\n\nThe nice thing is the type inference to avoid the noise of the actual types of the assert classes; so the code feels cleaner yet is nice and DRY.\n\nNot 100% sure on the name of the function; used `with` could be `assert` or something? Basically it just invokes the lamda with the current assertion object really ;).\n\nThoughts?
