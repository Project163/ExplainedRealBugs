\n\nIf I generate the assertion for my following POJO : \n\n``` java\npublic class User {\n\n    private Long id;\n    private String login;\n    private boolean enabled;\n\n    public User() {\n        enabled = true;\n    }\n\n    public Long getId() {\n        return id;\n    }\n\n    public User setId(Long id) {\n        this.id = id;\n        return this;\n    }\n\n    public String getLogin() {\n        return login;\n    }\n\n    public User setLogin(String login) {\n        this.login = login;\n        return this;\n    }\n\n    public boolean isEnabled() {\n        return enabled;\n    }\n\n    public User setEnabled(Boolean enabled) {\n        this.enabled = enabled;\n        return this;\n    }\n}\n```\n\nall works fine, but if I use the Boolean object type instead of the primitive type boolean, assertions associated to the Boolean field aren't generated.\n\nThe file not working : \n\n``` java\npublic class User {\n\n    private Long id;\n    private String login;\n    private Boolean enabled;\n\n    public User() {\n        enabled = true;\n    }\n\n    public Long getId() {\n        return id;\n    }\n\n    public User setId(Long id) {\n        this.id = id;\n
