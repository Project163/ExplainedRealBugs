Looks like it is working after all! Must be some magic going on there that I didn't understand. :smile:\n\nI did note that there are some cases in the generated assertions where it does a null check on the property before doing the main check, and if it is null then it throws an `AssertionError` directly rather than calling `failWithMessage()`. Unless there is some more magic that I don't understand, I'm guessing that these will not honour the `as()` setting?\n","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj-generator/issues/comments/71007747/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"kriegfrj","id":7224087,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcyMjQwODc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7224087?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kriegfrj","html_url":"https://github.com/kriegfrj","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kriegfrj/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kriegfrj/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kriegfrj/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kriegfrj/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kriegfrj/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kriegfrj/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kriegfrj/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kriegfrj/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kriegfrj/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj-generator/issues/comments/71107526","html_url":"https://github.com/assertj/assertj-generator/issues/36#issuecomment-71107526","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/assertj/assertj-generator/issues/36","id":71107526,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDcxMTA3NTI2","user":{"login":"joel-costigliola","id":382613,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4MjYxMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/382613?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola","html_url":"https://github.com/joel-costigliola","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-costigliola/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-01-22T21:58:31Z","updated_at":"2015-01-22T21:58:31Z","body":"You're
