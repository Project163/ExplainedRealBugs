haven't done any experiment but I think that is due to your generic classes, at runtime generic types are lost, since the assertions generator introspects classes, it is not aware that it should deal with Double.\n\nIf you were to write your `OfDouble`without generics, it should works fine (I'm not saying you can or you should, your design probably uses generics).\n\nI'm gonna investigate the issue anyway to confirm my assumption and see if can find the correct type at runtime anyway (I have my doubts though it is possible).\n\nI have priority work to do on assertj-core 3.2.0 so I won't

pull request adds support for deeper type inspections to allow for strong type guarantees and more type-based generation and features. The current PR is roughly feature parity and does not add more features -- the exception is adding generics to types when found (NOT when found on classes to generate). \r\n\r\nThe following changes were made: \r\n\r\n* Utilized Guava's `TypeToken<>` to fully introspect the classes being loaded and utilize this information to do better generation\r\n* Added consistent ordering to properties based on the property name then the original member\r\n* Cleaned up some unneeded code after the switch\r\n* Added consistent \"empty line\" spacing -- there is no spaces on empty lines after generation\r\n* Added more predicate prefixes\r\n* Replaced usages of `line.separator` with `\\n` because it causes issues on windows vs. unix\r\n* Updated tests to match any changes made\r\n\r\nI'm looking for insight into what should be done to have this merge, or if it's even wanted. 😄 \r\n\r\nThis closes #92. This also adds the required information to solve #57, and #51, I think.
