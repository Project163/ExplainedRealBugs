Setting this option to a value such as 200 500 or 1000 tells the TCP stack how long the accept queue can be If this option is not configured then the backlog depends on OS setting.
 | bossCount | consumer (advanced) | 1 | int | When netty works on nio mode it uses default bossCount parameter from Netty which is 1. User can use this operation to override the default bossCount from Netty
 | bossGroup | consumer (advanced) |  | EventLoopGroup | Set the BossGroup which could be used for handling the new connection of the server side across the NettyEndpoint
-| channelGroup | consumer (advanced) |  | ChannelGroup | To use a explicit ChannelGroup.
 | disconnectOnNoReply | consumer (advanced) | true | boolean | If sync is enabled then this option dictates NettyConsumer if it should disconnect where there is no reply to send back.
 | exceptionHandler | consumer (advanced) |  | ExceptionHandler | To let the consumer use a custom ExceptionHandler. Notice if the option bridgeErrorHandler is enabled then this options is not in use. By default the consumer will deal with exceptions that will be logged at WARN/ERROR level and ignored.
 | nettyServerBootstrapFactory | consumer (advanced) |  | NettyServerBootstrapFactory | To use a custom NettyServerBootstrapFactory

 | useByteBuf | producer (advanced) | false | boolean | If the useByteBuf is true netty producer will turn the message body into ByteBuf before sending it out.
 | bootstrapConfiguration | advanced |  | NettyServerBootstrapConfiguration | To use a custom configured NettyServerBootstrapConfiguration for configuring this endpoint.

 | exchangePattern | advanced | InOnly | ExchangePattern | Sets the default exchange pattern when creating an exchange
 | nativeTransport | advanced | false | boolean | Whether to use native transport instead of NIO. Native transport takes advantage of the host operating system and is only supported on some platforms. You need to add the netty JAR for the host operating system you are using. See more details at: http://netty.io/wiki/native-transports.html
 | options | advanced |  | Map | Allows to configure additional netty options using option. as prefix. For example option.child.keepAlive=false to set the netty option child.keepAlive=false. See the Netty documentation for possible options that can be used.
