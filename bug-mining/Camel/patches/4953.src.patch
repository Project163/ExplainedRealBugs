 Besides that account you'll need a _test user_ account that has `Bulk API Hard Delete` permission. You can create one by going to _My Developer Account_ (link from [developer.salesforce.com](https://login.salesforce.com/?lt=de)). Under _Administer_ expand _Manage Users_  and select _Profiles_ find _System Administrator_ profile and select _Clone_. Use `System Administrator With Hard Delete` as the profile name, and after saving under _Administrative Permissions_ click edit and tick _Bulk API Hard Delete_ and save. Next, create a new user under _Administer_ expand _Manage Users_  and select _Users_ and then click on _New User_. Fill in the required fields, and select _Salesforce_ for _User License_ and newly created profile for _Profile_. You get two user _Salesforce_ licenses so the newly created user will put you at a maximum.

 You'll need to access a Merchandise record and run a `Test Report` in order for them to appear in _Recent Items_ and _Recent Reports_. Do this by accessing _Warehouse_ application from the menu in the top right, and selecting _Merchandise_ click _Go!_ (preselected is View: _All_) and click on the single Merchandise item available. Next go to Reports and select and run _Test Report_ from _Test Reports_. This is needed by the integration tests as they access recent items and recently run reports.
