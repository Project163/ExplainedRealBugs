+== Upgrading Camel 3.22.x to 3.22.3
+
+=== camel-file
+
+The `readLock=changed` with using `readLockMinAge` has been restored to same behaviour as previously in 3.x.
+
+For example using `readLockMinAge=5s` would pickup files that are older than 5 seconds from startup time.
+If you have many existing files on startup that are old, then Camel will now again be fast,
+and pickup these files immediately.
