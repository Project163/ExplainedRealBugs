@@ -4,6 +4,63 @@ This document is for helping you upgrade your Apache Camel application
 from Camel 4.x to 4.y. For example, if you are upgrading Camel 4.0 to 4.2, then you should follow the guides
 from both 4.0 to 4.1 and 4.1 to 4.2.
 
+== Upgrading from 4.10.3 to 4.10.4
+
+=== Java DSL
+
+When using Choice EIP then in some situations you may need to use `.endChoice()`
+to be able to either continue added more nodes to the current Choice EIP, or that you
+are working with nested Choice EIPs (choice inside choice), then you may also need to use `endChoice`
+to go back to the parent choice to continue from there.
+
+However, there has been some regressions from upgrading older Camel releases to 4.11, and therefore
+we have refactored `endChoice` to work more consistent.
+
+For example the following code
+
+[source,java]
+----
+from("direct:start")
+    .choice()
+        .when(header("foo").isGreaterThan(1))
+            .choice()
+                .when(header("foo").isGreaterThan(5))
+                    .to("mock:big")
+                .otherwise()
+                    .to("mock:med")
+            .endChoice()
+        .otherwise()
+            .to("mock:low")
+        .end();
+----
+
+Should now be
+
+[source,java]
+----
+from("direct:start")
+    .choice()
+        .when(header("foo").isGreaterThan(1))
+            .choice()
+                .when(header("foo").isGreaterThan(5))
+                    .to("mock:big")
+                .otherwise()
+                    .to("mock:med")
+            .end().endChoice()
+        .otherwise()
+            .to("mock:low")
+        .end();
+----
+
+Notice that the `endChoice` is changed to `end().endChoice()`. This is required to be consistent
+to end the current choice (inner) and then afterwards change the scope to be Choice EIP to be able to
+continue in the outer Choice. Otherwise the Java DSL cannot know the scope is Choice EIP and you would
+not be able to add the `otherwise` block to the outer Choice.
