+== camel:prepare-fatjar
+
+The `camel:prepare-fatjar` goal of the Camel Maven Plugin is used to prepare your Camel application
+for being packaged as a _fat jar_. The goal scans the Maven dependencies to discover Camel JARs and
+extract if they have type converters, which gets merged together into a single _uber_ file stored
+in `target/classes/META-INF/services/org/apache/camel/UberTypeConverterLoader`.
+
+This _uber_ loader file contains all the combined type converters the Camel application uses at runtime.
+They are merged together into this single file.
+
+This is needed as otherwise the _fat jar_ maven plugins (such as maven-assembly-plugin, or maven-shade-plugin)
+causes the `TypeConverterLoader` files to be overwritten in the assembled JAR which causes not all type converters
+to be loaded by Camel.
+
+The `UberTypeConverterLoader` ensures they all type converters gets loaded as this file contains all the known
+type converter files.
+
+To use this goal, you can add the following to your Camel application `pom.xml` file:
