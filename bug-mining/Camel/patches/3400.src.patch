      * The {@link ShutdownStrategy} supports preparing for shutdown using two steps.
      * First a regular preparation, where the given forced parameter will be <tt>false</tt>.
      * And if the shutdown times out, then the {@link ShutdownStrategy} performs a more aggressive
      * shutdown, calling this method a second time with <tt>true</tt> for the given forced parameter.
-     * <p/>
      * For example by graceful stopping any threads or the likes.
      * <p/>
+     * In addition a service can also be suspended (not stopped), and when this happens the parameter
+     * <tt>suspendOnly</tt> has the value <tt>true</tt>. This can be used to prepare the service
+     * for suspension, such as marking a worker thread to skip action.
+     * <p/>
      * For forced shutdown, then the service is expected to aggressively shutdown any child services, such
      * as thread pools etc. This is the last chance it has to perform such duties.
