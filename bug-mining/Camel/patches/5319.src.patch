-=== camel-servlet and camel-http-common
-HttpRegistry and DefaultHttpRegistry classes from camel-servlet are moved from camel-servlet into camel-http-common.
-HttpRegistryProvider is added and used in DefaultHttpRegistry instead of CamelServlet which is implementing HttpRegistryProvider
-since DefaultHttpRegistry is used in camel-resteasy component where CamelResteasy servlet also implementing HttpRegistryProvider.

-These changes had effects on camel-atmosphere-websocket and camel-servlet and also camel-resteasy.

-take this change into account.
