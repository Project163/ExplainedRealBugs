 | Name | Description | Default | Type
+| *allowAutoWired ConnectionFactory* (advanced) | Whether to auto-discover ConnectionFactory from the registry, if no connection factory has been configured. If only one instance of ConnectionFactory is found then it will be used. This is enabled by default. | false | boolean
+| *allowAutoWired DestinationResolver* (advanced) | Whether to auto-discover DestinationResolver from the registry, if no destination resolver has been configured. If only one instance of DestinationResolver is found then it will be used. This is enabled by default. | false | boolean
 | *configuration* (advanced) | To use a shared JMS configuration |  | JmsConfiguration
 | *acceptMessagesWhile Stopping* (consumer) | Specifies whether the consumer accept messages while it is stopping. You may consider enabling this option, if you start and stop JMS routes at runtime, while there are still messages enqueued on the queue. If this option is false, and you stop the JMS route, then messages may be rejected, and the JMS broker would have to attempt redeliveries, which yet again may be rejected, and eventually the message may be moved at a dead letter queue on the JMS broker. To avoid this its recommended to enable this option. | false | boolean
 | *allowReplyManagerQuick Stop* (consumer) | Whether the DefaultMessageListenerContainer used in the reply managers for request-reply messaging allow the DefaultMessageListenerContainer.runningAllowed flag to quick stop in case JmsConfiguration#isAcceptMessagesWhileStopping is enabled, and org.apache.camel.CamelContext is currently being stopped. This quick stop ability is enabled by default in the regular JMS consumers but to enable for reply managers you must enable this flag. | false | boolean
