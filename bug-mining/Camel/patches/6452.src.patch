 The `camel-spring-boot` dependency no longer includes `camel-spring-xml`. To use legacy Spring XML files `<beans>`
 with Camel on Spring Boot, then include the `camel-spring-boot-xml-starter` dependency.
 
+=== Graceful Shutdown
+
+Camel now shutdowns a bit later during Spring Boot shutdown. This allows Spring Boot graceful shutdown
+to complete first (stopping Spring Boot HTTP server gracefully),
+and then afterward Camel is doing its own xref:graceful-shutdown.adoc[].
+
+Technically `camel-spring` has changed `getPhase()` from returning `Integer.MAX_VALUE` to
+`Integer.MAX_VALUE - 2049`. This gives room for Spring Boot services to shut down first.

 The `uri` tags are now static instead of dynamic (by default), as potential too many tags generated due to URI with dynamic values.
