+# Camel Servlet HttpRegistry Blueprint example
+
+### Introduction
+
+This example shows how to use `camel-servlet` [HttpRegistry](https://github.com/apache/camel/blob/master/components/camel-servlet/src/main/java/org/apache/camel/component/servlet/HttpRegistry.java) so that a `CamelServlet` can serve multiple OSGi bundles.
+
+### Build
+
+You will need to compile this example first:
+
+    mvn install
+
+### Run
+
+To install Apache Camel in Karaf you type in the shell (we use version ${project.version}):
+
+    feature:repo-add camel ${project.version}
+    feature:install camel
+
+First you need to install the following features in Karaf/ServiceMix with:
+
+    feature:install camel-servlet
+    feature:install war
+
+Then you can install the example:
+
+    install -s mvn:org.apache.camel.example/camel-example-servlet-httpregistry-blueprint/${project.version}
+
+And you can see the application running by tailing the logs
+
+    log:tail
+
+And you can use <kbd>ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>c</kbd> to stop tailing the log.
+
+There is a servlet that supports the following operation:
+
+- POST /camel/services/hello - to echo the request body
+
+From the command shell you can use `curl` to post a request to the servlet as shown below:
+
+    curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: text/plain" -d "Hello World" http://localhost:8181/camel/services/hello
+
+
+### Configuration
+
+This example is implemented in XML DSL in the [src/main/resources/OSGI-INF/blueprint/camel-context.xml](src/main/resources/OSGI-INF/blueprint/camel-context.xml) file.
+
+
+### Forum, Help, etc
+
+If you hit problems please let us know on the Camel Forums:
+    <http://camel.apache.org/discussion-forums.html>
+
+Please help us make Apache Camel better - we appreciate any feedback you may
+have.  Enjoy!
