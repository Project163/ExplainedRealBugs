@@ -96,7 +96,7 @@ with the following path and query parameters:
 | *probeContentType* (consumer) | Whether to enable probing of the content type. If enable then the consumer uses link FilesprobeContentType(java.nio.file.Path) to determine the content-type of the file and store that as a header with key link ExchangeFILE_CONTENT_TYPE on the Message. | false | boolean
 | *processStrategy* (consumer) | A pluggable org.apache.camel.component.file.GenericFileProcessStrategy allowing you to implement your own readLock option or similar. Can also be used when special conditions must be met before a file can be consumed such as a special ready file exists. If this option is set then the readLock option does not apply. |  | GenericFileProcess Strategy<T>
 | *startingDirectoryMustExist* (consumer) | Whether the starting directory must exist. Mind that the autoCreate option is default enabled which means the starting directory is normally auto created if it doesn't exist. You can disable autoCreate and enable this to ensure the starting directory must exist. Will thrown an exception if the directory doesn't exist. | false | boolean
-| *fileExist* (producer) | What to do if a file already exists with the same name. Override which is the default replaces the existing file. Append - adds content to the existing file. Fail - throws a GenericFileOperationException indicating that there is already an existing file. Ignore - silently ignores the problem and does not override the existing file but assumes everything is okay. Move - option requires to use the moveExisting option to be configured as well. The option eagerDeleteTargetFile can be used to control what to do if an moving the file and there exists already an existing file otherwise causing the move operation to fail. The Move option will move any existing files before writing the target file. TryRename Camel is only applicable if tempFileName option is in use. This allows to try renaming the file from the temporary name to the actual name without doing any exists check.This check may be faster on some file systems and especially FTP servers. | Override | GenericFileExist

 | *flatten* (producer) | Flatten is used to flatten the file name path to strip any leading paths so it's just the file name. This allows you to consume recursively into sub-directories but when you eg write the files to another directory they will be written in a single directory. Setting this to true on the producer enforces that any file name in CamelFileName header will be stripped for any leading paths. | false | boolean
 | *moveExisting* (producer) | Expression (such as File Language) used to compute file name to use when fileExist=Move is configured. To move files into a backup subdirectory just enter backup. This option only supports the following File Language tokens: file:name file:name.ext file:name.noext file:onlyname file:onlyname.noext file:ext and file:parent. Notice the file:parent is not supported by the FTP component as the FTP component can only move any existing files to a relative directory based on current dir as base. |  | String
 | *tempFileName* (producer) | The same as tempPrefix option but offering a more fine grained control on the naming of the temporary filename as it uses the File Language. |  | String
