+Take care of the fact that Bindy uses CHARSET_NAME property or the CHARSET_NAME header as define in the
+Exchange interface to do a characterset conversion of the inputstream received for unmarshalling.
+In some producers (e.g. file-endpoint) you can define a characterset. The characterset conversion
+can already been done by this producer. Sometimes you need to remove this property or header from the
+exchange before sending it to the unmarshal. If you don't remove it the conversion might be done twice
+which might lead to unwanted results.
