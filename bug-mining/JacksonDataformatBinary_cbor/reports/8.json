I haven't done a full investigation of the cause since calls to `CBORGenerator::writeStartObject` are very stateful. Here is the offending function.\r\n\r\n```\r\n@Override\r\n// since 2.8\r\npublic final void writeStartObject(Object forValue) throws IOException {\r\n    _verifyValueWrite(\"start an object\");\r\n    JsonWriteContext ctxt = _writeContext.createChildObjectContext();\r\n    _writeContext = ctxt;\r\n    if (forValue != null) {\r\n        ctxt.setCurrentValue(forValue);\r\n    }\r\n    if (_elementCountsPtr > 0) {\r\n        _elementCounts[_elementCountsPtr++] = _currentRemainingElements;\r\n    }\r\n    _currentRemainingElements = INDEFINITE_LENGTH;\r\n    _writeByte(BYTE_OBJECT_INDEFINITE);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAn example error producing call has `_elementCountsPtr = 11` and `_elementCounts.length = 10`. My guess at a solution and my current workaround is to add a safety check like in `CBORGenerator::writeStartArray`. Here is that function.\r\n```\r\n@Override\r\npublic void writeStartArray(int elementsToWrite) throws IOException {\r\n    _verifyValueWrite(\"start an array\");\r\n    _writeContext = _writeContext.createChildArrayContext();\r\n    if (_elementCounts.length == _elementCountsPtr) { // initially, as well as if full\r\n        _elementCounts = Arrays.copyOf(_elementCounts, _elementCounts.length+10);\r\n    }\r\n    _elementCounts[_elementCountsPtr++] = _currentRemainingElements;\r\n    _currentRemainingElements = elementsToWrite;\r\n    _writeLengthMarker(PREFIX_TYPE_ARRAY, elementsToWrite);\r\n}\r\n```\r\nAs you can see, the function resizes the _elementCounts array when required. I don't know what kind of coding styles you want to employ, but I would change the offending section in every `writeStartArray` and `writeStartObject` overload to read:\r\n```\r\n    if (_elementCounts.length <= _elementCountsPtr) { // less than or equal to catch more bad cases\r\n        //use _elementCountsPtr for new size to guarantee the array is big enough for this call\r\n        _elementCounts = Arrays.copyOf(_elementCounts, _elementCountsPtr+10); \r\n    }\r\n    if (_elementCountsPtr > 0) { //guard for negative indexes\r\n        _elementCounts[_elementCountsPtr++] = _currentRemainingElements;\r\n    }\r\n    \r\n```\r\n\r\nSorry I couldn't be more helpful with regard to why it is happening. Though I'd be happy to make a pull request with my described solution. Let me know what you think.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder","html_url":"https://github.com/cowtowncoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-dataformats-binary/issues/62/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-dataformats-binary/issues/62/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
