However, Jackson writes BigDecimals as tagged arrays containing their scale and unscaled value. The difference being that the value of BigDecimal is unscaled value * 10^-scale, which means the scale is the opposite of the exponent e.\r\n\r\nThe spec gives an example how 273.15 should be represented:\r\n\r\n    C4             -- Tag 4\r\n       82          -- Array of length 2\r\n          21       -- -2\r\n          19 6AB3  -- 27315\r\n\r\nHere is the actual representation:\r\n\r\n    C4             -- Tag 4\r\n       82          -- Array of length 2\r\n          02       -- 2\r\n          19 6AB3  -- 27315","closed_by":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder","html_url":"https://github.com/cowtowncoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-dataformats-binary/issues/139/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-dataformats-binary/issues/139/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
