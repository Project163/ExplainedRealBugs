That is, elements contain binary data, not Strings. And there is no default deserialization from binary data into String.\r\n\r\nBut in case of reading as tree, `BinaryNode` can apparently be read as text -- `getText()` will coerce value into Base64 encoded String.\r\n\r\nNow.... at this point, it'd be unclear if this is a bug. But looking at difference between `StringDeserializer` (used for \"simple\" `String` valued properties), it too does actually allow exposing Binary data as Base64-encoded String. Whereas `StringCollectionDeserializer` does not. Same problem would occur with `StringArrayDeserializer`, as both ultimate delegate to `_parseString()` method of `StdDeserializer`.\r\n\r\nSo. I think this qualifies as a bug, but one that can only affect formats that have native binary data type. I'll file a bug in databind and hopefully fix it.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime I would probably suggest mapping value as `List<byte[]>` instead of `List<String>` to better match actual contents.\r\n\r\n\r\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-dataformats-binary/issues/comments/551200412/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder","html_url":"https://github.com/cowtowncoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"actor":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder","html_url":"https://github.com/cowtowncoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-11-07T18:24:56Z","updated_at":"2019-11-07T18:24:56Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/2535","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/2535/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/2535/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/2535/events","html_url":"https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/2535","id":519435594,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU1MTk0MzU1OTQ=","number":2535,"title":"Allow

follow-up for https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-dataformats-binary/issues/188)\r\n\r\nSo: currently binary values (supported by some binary formats, but not textual formats like JSON or XML) can be coerced into `String` values (see `StringDeserializer.deserialize()` special case for `JsonToken.VALUE_EMBEDDED_OBJECT`); same is true for Tree Model based handling.\r\nThis is implemented by re-encoding binary as Base64 content.\r\nHowever, specialized String-value collection/array deserializers are missing this case: they use method \"_parseString()\" from `StdDeserializer`.\r\n\r\nGiven that default String handling does this, it makes sense to support same coercion for container cases.\r\n\r\nNote: testing probably needs to be done from format modules as JSON backend can not induce `VALUE_EMBEDDED_OBJECT` tokens (although testing handling of `TokenBuffer` might make sense -- maybe easiest still via binary codecs): for example, from cbor backend for which original issue was
