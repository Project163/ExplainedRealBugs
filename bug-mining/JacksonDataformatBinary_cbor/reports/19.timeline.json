for 2.12.2; 2 problems:\r\n\r\n1. Not verifying buffer boundary, matters for the specific case if the last byte implies existence one or more bytes of multi-byte UTF-8 character\r\n2. But also should verify UTF-8 encoding goodness: example case is broken (maybe it's Latin-1?); should fail earlier\r\n\r\nSlightly worried about (2) in a patch release (and hence no backport for 2.11) since while validation really should be done, no doubt some content exist where \"it used to 'work'\" (i.e. butchered occasionally mis-encoded character but no one noticed, or some validation removed that garbage later on), but we'll see.\r\nWill also file a follow-up issue for 2.13 since as of now validation of UTF-8 characters is inconsistent across code paths -- it shouldn't be, but it is. For 2.13 we can make things more strict more
