We at [Radix](https://www.radixdlt.com) are using CBOR. I just found strange behavior in encoding and decoding of this UTF string:\r\n`\"radix.particles.message\"`\r\n\r\nThe [Cbor playground cbor.me](http://cbor.me) encodes that into the byte string\r\n```\r\n77\r\n72616469782e7061727469636c65732e6d657373616765\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhich also both [SwiftCBOR](https://github.com/myfreeweb/SwiftCBOR) and [node-cbor](https://github.com/hildjj/node-cbor) do.\r\n\r\nBut Java Jacksson Cbor encodes it to:\r\n```\r\n7817\r\n72616469782e7061727469636c65732e6d657373616765\r\n```\r\n\r\nNotice the difference, the prefix `77` versus `7817`.\r\n\r\nThe interesting part is that both Cbor.me and SwiftCBOR **decodes**  `781772616469782e7061727469636c65732e6d657373616765` into the same UTF string: `\"radix.particles.message\"`.\r\n\r\nIn other words, two different byte strings decode into the same UTF string. \r\n\r\nIs that correct? \r\n\r\nAccording to the [RFC 7049](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7049), the major type is 3, i.e. `0b011` followed by the length of that string, which is 23 is decimal, which results in `0b10111 ` in binary, and `01110111` in hex is `77`. \r\n\r\nSo where does `7817` come from? And why does it correctly decode into the same UTF string?\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cbor/cbor.github.io/issues/49/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cbor/cbor.github.io/issues/49/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-dataformats-binary/issues/comments/491529580","html_url":"https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-dataformats-binary/issues/159#issuecomment-491529580","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-dataformats-binary/issues/159","id":491529580,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ5MTUyOTU4MA==","user":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder","html_url":"https://github.com/cowtowncoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-05-11T17:24:46Z","updated_at":"2019-05-11T17:24:46Z","body":"Hoping
