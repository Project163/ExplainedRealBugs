recently discovered that Jackson produces UTF strings on the non-shortest-possible format (non-canonical form ) sometimes.\r\n\r\nI first reported [this issue CBOR Github](https://github.com/cbor/cbor.github.io/issues/49) but realized that most other CBOR project is using canonical form where Jackson is not.\r\n\r\nIt would be great if you could support canonical encoding of strings :)
