the `invalid_out` test involving the simple value \"undefined\" (`0xf7`) some libraries like go-ipld-prime appear to fail, but that's because the programming language doesn't support undefined, and the decoder (dag-cbor or [neutral](https://github.com/fxamacker/cbor?tab=readme-ov-file#limitations)) is coercing undefined in the input to `nil` or `null` (`0xf6`). The same is happening in Rust with serde_ipld_dagcbor.\n\nThe test then fails because the encoder outputs `nil` without issue.\n\nHow to handle this is unclear.
