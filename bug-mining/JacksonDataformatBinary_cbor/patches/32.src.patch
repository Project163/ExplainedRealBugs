+
+Duncan. What bloody man is that? He can report,
+As seemeth by his plight, of the revolt
+The newest state. 
+Malcolm. This is the sergeant
+Who like a good and hardy soldier fought
+'Gainst my captivity. Hail, brave friend!
+Say to the king the knowledge of the broil
+As thou didst leave it. 
+Sergeant. Doubtful it stood;
+As two spent swimmers, that do cling together
+And choke their art. The merciless Macdonwald-
+Worthy to be a rebel, for to that
+The multiplying villanies of nature 
+Do swarm upon him-from the western isles
+Of kerns and gallowglasses is supplied;
+And fortune, on his damned quarrel smiling,
+Show'd like a rebel's whore: but all's too weak:
+For brave Macbeth-well he deserves that name- 
+Disdaining fortune, with his brandish'd steel,
+Which smoked with bloody execution,
+Like valour's minion carved out his passage
+Till he faced the slave;
+Which ne'er shook hands, nor bade farewell to him, 
+Till he unseam'd him from the nave to the chaps,
+And fix'd his head upon our battlements.
+Duncan. O valiant cousin! worthy gentleman!
+Sergeant. As whence the sun 'gins his reflection
+Shipwrecking storms and direful thunders break, 
+So from that spring whence comfort seem'd to come
+Discomfort swells. Mark, king of Scotland, mark:
+No sooner justice had with valour arm'd
+Compell'd these skipping kerns to trust their heels,
+But the Norweyan lord surveying vantage, 
+With furbish'd arms and new supplies of men
+Began a fresh assault.
+Duncan. Dismay'd not this
+Our captains, Macbeth and Banquo?
+Sergeant. Yes; 
+As sparrows eagles, or the hare the lion.
+If I say sooth, I must report they were
+As cannons overcharged with double cracks, so they
+Doubly redoubled strokes upon the foe:
+Except they meant to bathe in reeking wounds, 
+Or memorise another Golgotha,
+I cannot tell.
+But I am faint, my gashes cry for help.
+Duncan. So well thy words become thee as thy wounds;
+They smack of honour both. Go get him surgeons. 
+[Exit Sergeant, attended]
+Who comes here?
+[Enter ROSS]
+
+Malcolm. The worthy thane of Ross.
+Lennox. What a haste looks through his eyes! So should he look 
+That seems to speak things strange.
+Ross. God save the king!
+Duncan. Whence camest thou, worthy thane?
+Ross. From Fife, great king;
+Where the Norweyan banners flout the sky 
+And fan our people cold. Norway himself,
+With terrible numbers,
+Assisted by that most disloyal traitor
+The thane of Cawdor, began a dismal conflict;
+Till that Bellona's bridegroom, lapp'd in proof, 
+Confronted him with self-comparisons,
+Point against point rebellious, arm 'gainst arm.
+Curbing his lavish spirit: and, to conclude,
+The victory fell on us.
+Duncan. Great happiness! 
+Ross. That now
+Sweno, the Norways' king, craves composition:
+Nor would we deign him burial of his men
+Till he disbursed at Saint Colme's inch
+Ten thousand dollars to our general use. 
+Duncan. No more that thane of Cawdor shall deceive
+Our bosom interest: go pronounce his present death,
+And with his former title greet Macbeth.
+Ross. I'll see it done.
+Duncan. What he hath lost noble Macbeth hath won.

+Act I, Scene

+
+---
+[Thunder. Enter the three Witches]
+
+First Witch. Where hast thou been, sister?
+Second Witch. Killing swine.
+Third Witch. Sister, where thou? 
+First Witch. A sailor's wife had chestnuts in her lap,
+And munch'd, and munch'd, and munch'd:-
+'Give me,' quoth I:
+'Aroint thee, witch!' the rump-fed ronyon cries.
+Her husband's to Aleppo gone, master o' the Tiger: 
+Buty in a sieve I'll thither sail,
+And, like a rat without a tail,
+I'll do, I'll do, and I'll do.
+Second Witch. I'll give thee a wind.
+First Witch. Thou'rt kind. 
+Third Witch. And I another.
+First Witch. I myself have all the other,
+And the very ports they blow,
+All the quarters that they know
+I' the shipman's card. 
+I will drain him dry as hay:
+Sleep shall neither night nor day
+Hang upon his pent-house lid;
+He shall live a man forbid:
+Weary se'nnights nine times nine 
+Shall he dwindle, peak and pine:
+Though his bark cannot be lost,
+Yet it shall be tempest-tost.
+Look what I have.
+Second Witch. Show me, show me. 
+First Witch. Here I have a pilot's thumb,
+Wreck'd as homeward he did come.
+[Drum within]
+
+Third Witch. A drum, a drum!
+Macbeth doth come. 
+All. The weird sisters, hand in hand,
+Posters of the sea and land,
+Thus do go about, about:
+Thrice to thine and thrice to mine
+And thrice again, to make up nine. 
+Peace! the charm's wound up.
+[Enter MACBETH and BANQUO]
+
+Macbeth. So foul and fair a day I have not seen.
+Banquo. How far is't call'd to Forres? What are these
+So wither'd and so wild in their attire, 
+That look not like the inhabitants o' the earth,
+And yet are on't? Live you? or are you aught
+That man may question? You seem to understand me,
+By each at once her chappy finger laying
+Upon her skinny lips: you should be women, 
+And yet your beards forbid me to interpret
+That you are so.
+Macbeth. Speak, if you can: what are you?
+First Witch. All hail, Macbeth! hail to thee, thane of Glamis!
+Second Witch. All hail, Macbeth, hail to thee, thane of Cawdor! 
+Third Witch. All hail, Macbeth, thou shalt be king hereafter!
+Banquo. Good sir, why do you start; and seem to fear
+Things that do sound so fair? I' the name of truth,
+Are ye fantastical, or that indeed
+Which outwardly ye show? My noble partner 
+You greet with present grace and great prediction
+Of noble having and of royal hope,
+That he seems rapt withal: to me you speak not.
+If you can look into the seeds of time,
+And say which grain will grow and which will not, 
+Speak then to me, who neither beg nor fear
+Your favours nor your hate.
+First Witch. Hail!
+Second Witch. Hail!
+Third Witch. Hail! 
+First Witch. Lesser than Macbeth, and greater.
+Second Witch. Not so happy, yet much happier.
+Third Witch. Thou shalt get kings, though thou be none:
+So all hail, Macbeth and Banquo!
+First Witch. Banquo and Macbeth, all hail! 
+Macbeth. Stay, you imperfect speakers, tell me more:
+By Sinel's death I know I am thane of Glamis;
+But how of Cawdor? the thane of Cawdor lives,
+A prosperous gentleman; and to be king
+Stands not within the prospect of belief, 
+No more than to be Cawdor. Say from whence
+You owe this strange intelligence? or why
+Upon this blasted heath you stop our way
+With such prophetic greeting? Speak, I charge you.
+[Witches vanish]
+
+Banquo. The earth hath bubbles, as the water has,
+And these are of them. Whither are they vanish'd?
+Macbeth. Into the air; and what seem'd corporal melted
+As breath into the wind. Would they had stay'd!
+Banquo. Were such things here as we do speak about? 
+Or have we eaten on the insane root
+That takes the reason prisoner?
+Macbeth. Your children shall be kings.
+Banquo. You shall be king.
+Macbeth. And thane of Cawdor too: went it not so? 
+Banquo. To the selfsame tune and words. Who's here?
+[Enter ROSS and ANGUS]
+
+Ross. The king hath happily received, Macbeth,
+The news of thy success; and when he reads
+Thy personal venture in the rebels' fight, 
+His wonders and his praises do contend
+Which should be thine or his: silenced with that,
+In viewing o'er the rest o' the selfsame day,
+He finds thee in the stout Norweyan ranks,
+Nothing afeard of what thyself didst make, 
+Strange images of death. As thick as hail
+Came post with post; and every one did bear
+Thy praises in his kingdom's great defence,
+And pour'd them down before him.
+Angus. We are sent 
+To give thee from our royal master thanks;
+Only to herald thee into his sight,
+Not pay thee.
+Ross. And, for an eary	nest of a greater honour,
+He bade me, from him, call thee thane of Cawdor: 
+In which addition, hail, most worthy thane!
+For it is thine.
+Banquo. What, can the devil speak true?
+Macbeth. The thane of Cawdor lives: why do you dress me
+In borrow'd robes? 
+Angus. Who was the thane lives yet;
+But under heavy judgment bears that life
+Which he deserves to lose. Whether he was combined
+With those of Norway, or did line the rebel
+With hidden help and vantage, or that with both 
+He labour'd in his country's wreck, I know not;
+But treasons capital, confess'd and proved,
+Have overthrown him.
+Macbeth. [Aside] Glamis, and thane of Cawdor!
+The greatest is behind. 
+[To ROSS and ANGUS]
+Thanks for your pains.
+[To BANQUO]
+Do you not hope your children shall be kings,
+When those that gave the thane of Cawdor to me 
+Promised no less to them?
+Banquo. That trusted home
+Might yet enkindle you unto the crown,
+Besides the thane of Cawdor. But 'tis strange:
+And oftentimes, to win us to our harm, 
+The instruments of darkness tell us truths,
+Win us with honest trifles, to betray's
+In deepest consequence.
+Cousins, a word, I pray you.
+Macbeth. [Aside]. Two truths are told, 
+As happy prologues to the swelling act
+Of the imperial theme.-I thank you, gentlemen.
+[Aside] This supernatural soliciting]
+Cannot be ill, cannot be good: if ill,
+Why hath it given me earnest of success, 
+Commencing in a truth? I am thane of Cawdor:
+If good, why do I yield to that suggestion
+Whose horrid image doth unfix my hair
+And make my seated heart knock at my ribs,
+Against the use of nature? Present fears 
+Are less than horrible imaginings:
+My thought, whose murder yet is but fantastical,
+Shakes so my single state of man that function
+Is smother'd in surmise, and nothing is
+But what is not. 
+Banquo. Look, how our partner's rapt.
+Macbeth. [Aside] If chance will have me king, why, chance may crown me,
+Without my stir.
+Banquo. New horrors come upon him,
+Like our strange garments, cleave not to their mould 
+But with the aid of use.
+Macbeth. [Aside] Come what come may,
+Time and the hour runs through the roughest day.
+Banquo. Worthy Macbeth, we stay upon your leisure.
+Macbeth. Give me your favour: my dull brain was wrought 
+With things forgotten. Kind gentlemen, your pains
+Are register'd where every day I turn
+The leaf to read them. Let us toward the king.
+Think upon what hath chanced, and, at more time,
+The interim having weigh'd it, let us speak 
+Our free hearts each to other.
+Banquo. Very gladly.
+Macbeth. Till then, enough. Come, friends.

+Do you not hope your children shall be kings,
+When those that gave the thane of Cawdor to me 
+Promised no less to them?
+Banquo. That trusted home
+Might yet enkindle you unto the crown,
+Besides the thane of Cawdor. But 'tis strange:
+And oftentimes, to win us to our harm, 
+The instruments of darkness tell us truths,
+Win us with honest trifles, to betray's
+In deepest consequence.
+Cousins, a word, I pray you.
+Macbeth. [Aside]. Two truths are told, 
+As happy prologues to the swelling act
+Of the imperial theme.-I thank you, gentlemen.
+[Aside] This supernatural soliciting]
+Cannot be ill, cannot be good: if ill,
+Why hath it given me earnest of success, 
+Commencing in a truth? I am thane of Cawdor:
+If good, why do I yield to that suggestion
+Whose horrid image doth unfix my hair
+And make my seated heart knock at my ribs,
+Against the use of nature? Present fears 
+Are less than horrible imaginings:
+My thought, whose murder yet is but fantastical,
+Shakes so my single state of man that function
+Is smother'd in surmise, and nothing is
+But what is not. 
+Banquo. Look, how our partner's rapt.
+Macbeth. [Aside] If chance will have me king, why, chance may crown me,
+Without my stir.
+Banquo. New horrors come upon him,
+Like our strange garments, cleave not to their mould 
+But with the aid of use.
+Macbeth. [Aside] Come what come may,
+Time and the hour runs through the roughest day.
+Banquo. Worthy Macbeth, we stay upon your leisure.
+Macbeth. Give me your favour: my dull brain was wrought 
+With things forgotten. Kind gentlemen, your pains
+Are register'd where every day I turn
+The leaf to read them. Let us toward the king.
+Think upon what hath chanced, and, at more time,
+The interim having weigh'd it, let us speak 
+Our free hearts each to other.
+Banquo. Very gladly.
+Macbeth. Till then, enough. Come, friends.

+Act I, Scene  
+
+A desert place.
+---
+
+First Witch. When shall we three meet again
+In thunder, lightning, or in rain?
+Second Witch. When the hurlyburly's done,
+When the battle's lost and won. 
+Third Witch. That will be ere the set of sun.
+First Witch. Where the place?
+Second Witch. Upon the heath.
+Third Witch. There to meet with Macbeth.
+First Witch. I come, Graymalkin! 
+Second Witch. Paddock calls.
+Third Witch. Anon.
+All. Fair is foul, and foul is fair:
+Hover through the fog and filthy air.
+
+---
+Act I, Scene  
+
+A camp near Forres.
+---
+
+Duncan. What bloody man is that? He can report,
+As seemeth by his plight, of the revolt
+The newest state. 
+Malcolm. This is the sergeant
+Who like a good and hardy soldier fought
+'Gainst my captivity. Hail, brave friend!
+Say to the king the knowledge of the broil
+As thou didst leave it. 
+Sergeant. Doubtful it stood;
+As two spent swimmers, that do cling together
+And choke their art. The merciless Macdonwald-
+Worthy to be a rebel, for to that
+The multiplying villanies of nature 
+Do swarm upon him-from the western isles
+Of kerns and gallowglasses is supplied;
+And fortune, on his damned quarrel smiling,
+Show'd like a rebel's whore: but all's too weak:
+For brave Macbeth-well he deserves that name- 
+Disdaining fortune, with his brandish'd steel,
+Which smoked with bloody execution,
+Like valour's minion carved out his passage
+Till he faced the slave;
+Which ne'er shook hands, nor bade farewell to him, 
+Till he unseam'd him from the nave to the chaps,
+And fix'd his head upon our battlements.
+Duncan. O valiant cousin! worthy gentleman!
+Sergeant. As whence the sun 'gins his reflection
+Shipwrecking storms and direful thunders break, 
+So from that spring whence comfort seem'd to come
+Discomfort swells. Mark, king of Scotland, mark:
+No sooner justice had with valour arm'd
+Compell'd these skipping kerns to trust their heels,
+But the Norweyan lord surveying vantage, 
+With furbish'd arms and new supplies of men
+Began a fresh assault.
+Duncan. Dismay'd not this
+Our captains, Macbeth and Banquo?
+Sergeant. Yes; 
+As sparrows eagles, or the hare the lion.
+If I say sooth, I must report they were
+As cannons overcharged with double cracks, so they
+Doubly redoubled strokes upon the foe:
+Except they meant to bathe in reeking wounds, 
+Or memorise another Golgotha,
+I cannot tell.
+But I am faint, my gashes cry for help.
+Duncan. So well thy words become thee as thy wounds;
+They smack of honour both. Go get him surgeons. 
+[Exit Sergeant, attended]
+Who comes here?
+[Enter ROSS]
+
+Malcolm. The worthy thane of Ross.
+Lennox. What a haste looks through his eyes! So should he look 
+That seems to speak things strange.
+Ross. God save the king!
+Duncan. Whence camest thou, worthy thane?
+Ross. From Fife, great king;
+Where the Norweyan banners flout the sky 
+And fan our people cold. Norway himself,
+With terrible numbers,
+Assisted by that most disloyal traitor
+The thane of Cawdor, began a dismal conflict;
+Till that Bellona's bridegroom, lapp'd in proof, 
+Confronted him with self-comparisons,
+Point against point rebellious, arm 'gainst arm.
+Curbing his lavish spirit: and, to conclude,
+The victory fell on us.
+Duncan. Great happiness! 
+Ross. That now
+Sweno, the Norways' king, craves composition:
+Nor would we deign him burial of his men
+Till he disbursed at Saint Colme's inch
+Ten thousand dollars to our general use. 
+Duncan. No more that thane of Cawdor shall deceive
+Our bosom interest: go pronounce his present death,
+And with his former title greet Macbeth.
+Ross. I'll see it done.
+Duncan. What he hath lost noble Macbeth hath won. 
+[Exeunt]

+Act I, Scene  
+
+A heath near Forres.
+
+---
+[Thunder. Enter the three Witches]
+
+First Witch. Where hast thou been, sister?
+Second Witch. Killing swine.
+Third Witch. Sister, where thou? 
+First Witch. A sailor's wife had chestnuts in her lap,
+And munch'd, and munch'd, and munch'd:-
+'Give me,' quoth I:
+'Aroint thee, witch!' the rump-fed ronyon cries.
+Her husband's to Aleppo gone, master o' the Tiger: 
+But in a sieve I'll thither sail,
+And, like a rat without a tail,
+I'll do, I'll do, and I'll do.
+Second Witch. I'll give thee a wind.
+First Witch. Thou'rt kind. 
+Third Witch. And I another.
+First Witch. I myself have all the other,
+And the very ports they blow,
+All the quarters that they know
+I' the shipman's card. 
+I will drain him dry as hay:
+Sleep shall neither night nor day
+Hang upon his pent-house lid;
+He shall live a man forbid:
+Weary se'nnights nine times nine 
+Shall he dwindle, peak and pine:
+Though his bark cannot be lost,
+Yet it shall be tempest-tost.
+Look what I have.
+Second Witch. Show me, show me. 
+First Witch. Here I have a pilot's thumb,
+Wreck'd as homeward he did come.
+[Drum within]
+
+Third Witch. A drum, a drum!
+Macbeth doth come. 
+All. The weird sisters, hand in hand,
+Posters of the sea and land,
+Thus do go about, about:
+Thrice to thine and thrice to mine
+And thrice again, to make up nine. 
+Peace! the charm's wound up.
+[Enter MACBETH and BANQUO]
+
+Macbeth. So foul and fair a day I have not seen.
+Banquo. How far is't call'd to Forres? What are these
+So wither'd and so wild in their attire, 
+That look not like the inhabitants o' the earth,
+And yet are on't? Live you? or are you aught
+That man may question? You seem to understand me,
+By each at once her chappy finger laying
+Upon her skinny lips: you should be women, 
+And yet your beards forbid me to interpret
+That you are so.
+Macbeth. Speak, if you can: what are you?
+First Witch. All hail, Macbeth! hail to thee, thane of Glamis!
+Second Witch. All hail, Macbeth, hail to thee, thane of Cawdor! 
+Third Witch. All hail, Macbeth, thou shalt be king hereafter!
+Banquo. Good sir, why do you start; and seem to fear
+Things that do sound so fair? I' the name of truth,
+Are ye fantastical, or that indeed
+Which outwardly ye show? My noble partner 
+You greet with present grace and great prediction
+Of noble having and of royal hope,
+That he seems rapt withal: to me you speak not.
+If you can look into the seeds of time,
+And say which grain will grow and which will not, 
+Speak then to me, who neither beg nor fear
+Your favours nor your hate.
+First Witch. Hail!
+Second Witch. Hail!
+Third Witch. Hail! 
+First Witch. Lesser than Macbeth, and greater.
+Second Witch. Not so happy, yet much happier.
+Third Witch. Thou shalt get kings, though thou be none:
+So all hail, Macbeth and Banquo!
+First Witch. Banquo and Macbeth, all hail! 
+Macbeth. Stay, you imperfect speakers, tell me more:
+By Sinel's death I know I am thane of Glamis;
+But how of Cawdor? the thane of Cawdor lives,
+A prosperous gentleman; and to be king
+Stands not within the prospect of belief, 
+No more than to be Cawdor. Say from whence
+You owe this strange intelligence? or why
+Upon this blasted heath you stop our way
+With such prophetic greeting? Speak, I charge you.
+[Witches vanish]
+
+Banquo. The earth hath bubbles, as the water has,
+And these are of them. Whither are they vanish'd?
+Macbeth. Into the air; and what seem'd corporal melted
+As breath into the wind. Would they had stay'd!
+Banquo. Were such things here as we do speak about? 
+Or have we eaten on the insane root
+That takes the reason prisoner?
+Macbeth. Your children shall be kings.
+Banquo. You shall be king.
+Macbeth. And thane of Cawdor too: went it not so? 
+Banquo. To the selfsame tune and words. Who's here?
+[Enter ROSS and ANGUS]
+
+Ross. The king hath happily received, Macbeth,
+The news of thy success; and when he reads
+Thy personal venture in the rebels' fight, 
+His wonders and his praises do contend
+Which should be thine or his: silenced with that,
+In viewing o'er the rest o' the selfsame day,
+He finds thee in the stout Norweyan ranks,
+Nothing afeard of what thyself didst make, 
+Strange images of death. As thick as hail
+Came post with post; and every one did bear
+Thy praises in his kingdom's great defence,
+And pour'd them down before him.
+Angus. We are sent 
+To give thee from our royal master thanks;
+Only to herald thee into his sight,
+Not pay thee.
+Ross. And, for an earnest of a greater honour,
+He bade me, from him, call thee thane of Cawdor: 
+In which addition, hail, most worthy thane!
+For it is thine.
+Banquo. What, can the devil speak true?
+Macbeth. The thane of Cawdor lives: why do you dress me
+In borrow'd robes? 
+Angus. Who was the thane lives yet;
+But under heavy judgment bears that life
+Which he deserves to lose. Whether he was combined
+With those of Norway, or did line the rebel
+With hidden help and vantage, or that with both 
+He labour'd in his country's wreck, I know not;
+But treasons capital, confess'd and proved,
+Have overthrown him.
+Macbeth. [Aside] Glamis, and thane of Cawdor!
+The greatest is behind. 
+[To ROSS and ANGUS]
+Thanks for your pains.
+[To BANQUO]
+Do you not hope your children shall be kings,
+When those that gave the thane of Cawdor to me 
+Promised no less to them?
+Banquo. That trusted home
+Might yet enkindle you unto the crown,
+Besides the thane of Cawdor. But 'tis strange:
+And oftentimes, to win us to our harm, 
+The instruments of darkness tell us truths,
+Win us with honest trifles, to betray's
+In deepest consequence.
+Cousins, a word, I pray you.
+Macbeth. [Aside]. Two truths are told, 
+As happy prologues to the swelling act
+Of the imperial theme.-I thank you, gentlemen.
+[Aside] This supernatural soliciting]
+Cannot be ill, cannot be good: if ill,
+Why hath it given me earnest of success, 
+Commencing in a truth? I am thane of Cawdor:
