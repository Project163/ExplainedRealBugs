 Alternatively, since pylint emits a separate error for attributes that cannot be
 found in C extensions, ``c-extension-no-member``, you can disable this error for
 your project.

+If something is generated dynamically, pylint won't be able to understand the code
+from your library (c-extension or not). You can then specify generated attributes
+with the ``generated-members`` option. For example if ``cv2.LINE_AA`` and
+``sphinx.generated_member`` create false positives for ``no-member``, you can do::
