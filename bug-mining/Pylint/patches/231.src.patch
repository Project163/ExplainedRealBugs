+Upgrading pylint
+================
+
+You should probably set the version of pylint in your development environment in order to
+choose when you actually upgrade pylint's warnings. pylint is following semver versioning.
+But we can't guarantee that the output between version will stays the same. What this means
+is that:
+
+.. include:: ../../development_guide/contributor_guide/patch_release.rst
+
+You can expect less messages if you set the minor and upgrade to a new patch version.
+But still, if you enable ``useless-suppression`` it still means you can get a new
+``useless-suppression`` when a false positive that you disabled is now fixed. Also,
+if a library you're using was upgraded and is understood better or worse than the
+previous one, you could get new messages too.
+
+.. include:: ../../development_guide/contributor_guide/minor_release.rst
+
+You can expect a lot more change in output, the main one being new checks.
+
+.. include:: ../../development_guide/contributor_guide/major_release.rst
+
+You could have to change the command you're launching or the plugin and
+editor integration you're using.
