 .. Note::
 
     ``my_plugin`` refers to a module called ``my_plugin.py``.
-    This module can be made available to pylint by putting this
-    module's parent directory in your ``PYTHONPATH``
-    environment variable or by adding the ``my_plugin.py``
-    file to the ``pylint/checkers`` directory if running from source.
+    The preferred way of making this plugin available to pylint is
+    by installing it as a package. This can be done either from a packaging index like
+    ``PyPI`` or by installing it from a local source such as with ``pip install``.
+
+    Alternatively, the plugin module can be made available to pylint by
+    putting this module's parent directory in your ``PYTHONPATH``
+    environment variable.
+
+    If your pylint config has an ``init-hook`` that modifies
+    ``sys.path`` to include the module's parent directory, this
+    will also work, but only if either:
+
+    * the ``init-hook`` and the ``load-plugins`` list are both
+      defined in a configuration file, or...
+    * the ``init-hook`` is passed as a command-line argument and
+      the ``load-plugins`` list is in the configuration file
+
+    So, you cannot load a custom plugin by modifying ``sys.path`` if you
+    supply the ``init-hook`` in a configuration file, but pass the module name
+    in via ``--load-plugins`` on the command line.
+    This is because pylint loads plugins specified on command
+    line before loading any configuration from other sources.
