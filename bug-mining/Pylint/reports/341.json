This is awesome, since you will see the warnings/errors in the summary of your last run and directly in the `Files changed` tab in pull requests (PRs). As an example, consider this image:\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://github.com/pylint-dev/pylint/assets/37160523/cb71a9de-4e60-4485-b12a-b6f6f26eab3f\" width=\"400px\"/>\r\n\r\nRuboCop (the linter/formatter for Ruby code) has an [**\"GitHub Actions Formatter\"**](https://docs.rubocop.org/rubocop/formatters.html#github-actions-formatter) directly included:\r\n\r\n> Useful for GitHub Actions.
