While `Needs design proposal` signals that we appreciate somebody else to propose something that we can respond to, `Needs decision` just signals that a maintainer has some more smaller choices to make before a contributor can start working on it.\r\n\r\n`Needs decision`: a maintainer needs to make decisions\r\n`Needs design proposal`: we're looking for a suggestion on how to solve this to which a maintainer can then respond\r\n`Needs PR`: this design is finished and can be implemented.\r\n\r\nIdeally `Needs PR` leaves issues in such a state that a new contributor can read them once and start implementing without having to come back to the issue and asking follow-up questions. Stuff like test and edge cases, names, where to put the file etc. could all be helpful.\r\nThat's not to say every issue needs all of those, but the contributor shouldn't need to make too many decisions
