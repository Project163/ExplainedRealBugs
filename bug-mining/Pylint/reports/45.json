Run PyLint with output-format = json on any file that generates error or warning messages\r\n\r\n### Current behavior\r\nThe returned results have no \"msg_id\" field, so the caller cannot process the results based on the message type which is unique to the msg_id, as opposed to the actual message text.\r\n\r\nThe currently returned fields are:  message, line, module, path, symbol, type, column, obj\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\nInclude the msg_id field in the returned JSON dictionaries by default, just as the msg_id is returned by default in the other output-formats.    \r\n\r\nThe impact on existing user code should be minimal for those that are using normal JSON decoders as the additional field will be ignored as an unused field in the resultant dictionary.\r\n\r\nAdditional note:  It would be nice if the \"msg-template\" option could be used to control the fields being returned by the json output-format just like it does for the other output-formats, e.g.  msg-template = '{{ \"id\":{msg_id}, \"location\": {obj}, \"line\":{line}, \"msg\":{message}\" }}'\r\n\r\n\r\n### pylint --version output\r\n\r\nNo config file found, using default configuration\r\npylint 1.7.1,\r\nastroid 1.5.2\r\nPython 3.5.3 (v3.5.3:1880cb95a742, Jan 16 2017, 16:02:32) [MSC v.1900 64 bit (AMD64)]\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"PCManticore","id":448166,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0ODE2Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/448166?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/PCManticore","html_url":"https://github.com/PCManticore","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PCManticore/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PCManticore/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PCManticore/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PCManticore/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PCManticore/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PCManticore/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PCManticore/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PCManticore/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PCManticore/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pylint-dev/pylint/issues/1512/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pylint-dev/pylint/issues/1512/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
