This differs from `missing-param-doc`, `missing-raises-doc`, and `missing-type-doc` which are not produced for functions without a docstring.\r\n\r\nSince `pylint.extensions.docparams` does not use the `no-docstring-rgx` or `docstring-min-length` options, producing these errors for missing docstrings is problematic.  It provides no way to configure pylint to warn about missing return/yield documentation only when documentation is required (e.g. ignoring undocumented private methods) which seems like a valuable use case.\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\n1. Create `.pylintrc` with the following content:\r\n```ini\r\n[MASTER]\r\nload-plugins = pylint.extensions.docparams\r\n\r\n[BASIC]\r\naccept-no-param-doc = no\r\naccept-no-raise-doc = no\r\naccept-no-return-doc = no\r\naccept-no-yields-doc = no\r\n```\r\n2. Create `fixture_docparams_missing.py` with the following content:\r\n```py\r\n\"\"\"Fixture for testing missing documentation in docparams.\"\"\"\r\n\r\ndef _private_func(param1):\r\n    if param1:\r\n        raise Exception('Example')\r\n    return param1\r\n\r\ndef _private_func2(param1):\r\n    yield param1\r\n```\r\n3.  Run `pylint fixture_docparams_missing.py`\r\n\r\n### Current behavior\r\n\r\n    ************* Module fixture_docparams_missing\r\n    fixture_docparams_missing.py:3:0: W9011: Missing return documentation (missing-return-doc)\r\n    fixture_docparams_missing.py:3:0: W9012: Missing return type documentation (missing-return-type-doc)\r\n    fixture_docparams_missing.py:8:0: W9013: Missing yield documentation (missing-yield-doc)\r\n    fixture_docparams_missing.py:8:0: W9014: Missing yield type documentation (missing-yield-type-doc)\r\n    \r\n    ------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n    Your code has been rated at 3.33/10 (previous run: 3.33/10, +0.00)\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\n\r\nNo errors (due to `missing-docstring` suppressed by default `no-docstring-rgx`).\r\n\r\nAlternatively, all `missing-*` error types produced by `pylint.extensions.docparams` and a configuration option to suppress the errors in a similar way to `no-docstring-rgx`.\r\n\r\n### pylint --version output\r\n\r\nFrom a local clone of 51e12f81:\r\n\r\n    __main__.py 2.3.0-dev1\r\n    astroid 2.1.0\r\n    Python 3.7.2+ (default, Feb  2 2019, 14:31:48) \r\n    [GCC 8.2.0]\r\n\r\nThanks for considering,\r\nKevin","closed_by":{"login":"hippo91","id":11694943,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNjk0OTQz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11694943?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hippo91","html_url":"https://github.com/hippo91","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hippo91/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hippo91/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hippo91/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hippo91/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hippo91/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hippo91/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hippo91/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hippo91/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hippo91/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pylint-dev/pylint/issues/2738/reactions","total_count":5,"+1":5,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pylint-dev/pylint/issues/2738/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
