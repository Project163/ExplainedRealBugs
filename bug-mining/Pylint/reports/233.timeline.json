Bug description\r\n\r\nWith some code like this:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n# pylint: disable=missing-module-docstring\r\n\r\nparts = [\"a\", \"b\", \"c\", \"d\"]\r\nfor i, part in enumerate(parts):\r\n    if i == 3:  # more complex condition actually\r\n        parts.insert(i, \"X\")\r\n    print(part, parts[i])\r\n```\r\n\r\n([real-world example](https://github.com/qutebrowser/qutebrowser/blob/1996c4d7e72bb3764cd4ea316f8cf84d4fc32dca/qutebrowser/completion/completer.py#L154-L165)), pylint claims that `parts[i]` could be replaced by `part` - but as running the file shows, that isn't actually the case:\r\n\r\n```\r\na a\r\nb b\r\nc c\r\nd X\r\nd d\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou might think that this is a bit unorthodox (and I might agree, should probably rewrite this...), but if I'm reading the [Python docs](https://docs.python.org/3.7/reference/compound_stmts.html#the-for-statement) right, the behavior is well-defined (emphasis mine):\r\n\r\n> There is a subtlety when the sequence is being modified by the loop (this can only occur for mutable sequences, e.g. lists). An internal counter is used to keep track of which item is used next, and this is incremented on each iteration. When this counter has reached the length of the sequence the loop terminates. This means that if the suite deletes the current (or a previous) item from the sequence, the next item will be skipped (since it gets the index of the current item which has already been treated). Likewise, **if the suite inserts an item in the sequence before the current item, the current item will be treated again the next time through the loop**.\r\n\r\ncc @timmartin who added the checker in
