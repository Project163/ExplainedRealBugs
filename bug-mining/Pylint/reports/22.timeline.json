pass\n```\n\nHowever. First of all, I don't know the Pylint codebase well enough know why this is either being skipped or it is marked as a pass; It shouldn't. I want to point a finger to the `pylintrc` file, but I won't be so brash. Running pylint without any arguments,  `pylint pylint/test/functional/unused_argument.py`, appears to confirm my point.\n#### pylint output\n\n```\nI:  1, 0: Locally disabling missing-docstring (C0111) (locally-disabled)\nI:  1, 0: Locally disabling too-few-public-methods (R0903) (locally-disabled)\nW:  3,23: Unused argument 'second' (unused-argument)\nW:  3,31: Unused argument '_not_used' (unused-argument)\nW:  3,16: Unused argument 'first' (unused-argument)\nW: 25,29: Unused argument 'aay' (unused-argument)\n```\n\nSecondly, my test would fix this broken test. With a little more knowledge on the unittest setup, I would like to break the test to demonstrate that `unused-arguments` are also fixed by my commit.\n### tox\n\nTests have been run using the vanilla `tox` command with all tests passing, except for `jython` because I have a setup issue.
