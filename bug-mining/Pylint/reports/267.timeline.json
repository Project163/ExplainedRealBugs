There are no real blockers in terms of PRs, just a number of PRs we/I would like to get in but haven't gotten around to reviewing. The issue with `astroid` is that most of the current maintainers of `pylint` are not as experienced with the internals of `astroid` so reviewing PRs and iterating on them takes considerably longer.\r\nWe're getting more and more experienced, but it takes some time.
