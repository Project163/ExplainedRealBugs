created a small `utils` function that checks whether the name appears in any of the `AssignName` nodes in the scope.\r\n\r\nThe updated test only throws an error for 2 of the 4 variables. Not quite sure what that is about and we might want to make another issue/PR to fix that. However, since the change did not break any of the tests the file is designed for I guessed it was okay for now. This PR does fix the original issue.\r\n\r\nThis closes #1375\r\nThis closes
