Bug description\n\nHere's a typical example of W0120 being raised:\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef f():\r\n    while True:\r\n        if condition:\r\n            pass\r\n    else:\r\n        pass\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd this code **doesn't** raise W0120 (correctly):\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef f():\r\n    while True:\r\n        if condition:\r\n            break\r\n    else:\r\n        pass\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut, this code is pretty much identical in function and it **does** raise W0120 (bug):\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef f():\r\n    while True:\r\n        if condition:\r\n            return\r\n    else:\r\n        pass\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe check for W0120 should check for both `break` and `return` in the while block.\n\n### Configuration\n\n_No response_\n\n### Command
