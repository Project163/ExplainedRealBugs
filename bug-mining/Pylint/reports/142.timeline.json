---------------------- |\r\n| ✓   | :hammer: Refactoring   |\r\n\r\n## Description\r\n\r\nThis PR has two related aims:\r\n1) Add typing to all `visit_...` and `leave_...` calls in the codebase\r\n2) Fix some outstanding mypy issues\r\nAs a result of doing the former the number of mypy issues increased so it seemed logical to take another look at some of the open issues (based on comments meant to ignore mypy). I did not add a changelog contribution.\r\n\r\nBefore merging there are a small number of calls for which I did not find documentation and therefore I could not add the type annotations. I think it would be best to add those before merging this, to make sure this PR catches all calls.\r\nThe missing annotations are for:\r\n~`visit_exec`~\r\n~`visit_default`~\r\n`visit_print`\r\n`visit_repr`\r\n`visit_package`\r\n`visit_instance`\r\n~`visit_project`~\r\nDoes any of the maintainers know the nodes passed into these calls? And if so, can you give me a list or add them

Bug description\r\n\r\nI have a test that runs a pytest session using [Pytester](https://docs.pytest.org/en/6.2.x/reference.html#pytester) and executes pylint through the pytest-pylint plugin. Under these circumstances I'm getting the following error:\r\n```\r\ntests/pytest_project/test_core.py::test_run_errors Unable to create directory /tmp/pytest-of-user/pytest-1/test_run_errors0/.cache/pylint\r\nUnable to create file /tmp/pytest-of-user/pytest-1/test_run_errors0/.cache/pylint/test_run_errors1.stats: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: '/tmp/pytest-of-user/pytest-1/test_run_errors0/.cache/pylint/test_run_errors1.stats'\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf I create the `.cache` folder manually it succeeds. However, it would be great if pylint could create the necessary parent folders are well when trying to create the `pylint` folder inside `XDG_CACHE_HOME`.\r\n\r\n### Command used\r\n\r\nPylint is
