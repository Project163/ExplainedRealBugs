Try to use `py_run` as described in the docstring here https://github.com/PyCQA/pylint/blob/master/pylint/epylint.py#L119\r\n2. For example using a script like \r\n```\r\nfrom pylint import epylint as lint\r\n\r\noutput, _ = lint.py_run(command_options='--version', return_std=True)\r\nprint(output.read())\r\n```\r\n3. Or emulate the behavior in the shell `$ python -c \"from pylint import epylint;epylint.Run()\" --version`\r\n\r\n### Current behavior\r\nPylint interprets `--version` as file and prints `--version does not exist`\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\nShould actually print the version. The same issue pertains other commands like `--generate-rcfile` that are passed to pylint without a file.\r\n\r\n### pylint --version output\r\nWell it depends how you call it :smiley:  .
