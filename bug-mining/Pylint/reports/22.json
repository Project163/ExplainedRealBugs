Have a \"dummy\" variable that has an underscore in it's root name.\n   - **Root Name:** The variable name without the dummy prefix, underscore (`_`).\n   - **Example:** root: `unused_var`, dummy-fied: `_unused_var`. \n2. Run code against pylint, it will complain that `_unused_var` is an `unused_variable` (or an `unused-argument`).\n\n_Note:_ Discovered when investigating https://github.com/PyCQA/pylint/issues/1057\n### Current behavior\n\nPylint will **not** ignore \"dummy\" variables (a variable that has been prefixed with an underscore) when they have an underscore (`_`) elsewhere in their name.\n#### Unused Argument\n\nPylint reports `[unused-argument] Unused argument '_never_used'` for:\n\n``` python\ndef test_unused_arg(_unused_arg):\n    \"\"\"_unused_arg should be ignored, but it isn't.\"\"\"\n    assert False\n```\n#### Unused Variable\n\nPylint reports `[unused-variable] Unused variable '_unused_var'` for:\n\n```\ndef test_unused_var():\n    \"\"\"_unused_var should be ignored, but it isn't.\"\"\"\n    _unused_var = True\n    assert False\n```\n### Expected behavior\n\nAll \"dummy\" variables should be ignored. The problems comes down the default regular express for `dummy-variables-rgx`.\n\n**Current default setting:**\n\n```\ndummy-variables-rgx=(_+[a-zA-Z0-9]*?$)|dummy\n```\n\n**Proposed change:**\nThe proposed change, simply, adds an underscore.\n\n```\ndummy-variables-rgx=(_+[a-zA-Z0-9_]*?$)|dummy\n```\n### pylint --version output\n\n```\npylint 1.6.4,\n$ pylint --version\nastroid 1.4.7\nPython 2.7.11 (default, Mar 15 2016, 09:47:58)\n[GCC 4.2.1 Compatible Apple LLVM 7.0.2 (clang-700.1.81)]\n```\n","closed_by":{"login":"PCManticore","id":448166,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0ODE2Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/448166?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/PCManticore","html_url":"https://github.com/PCManticore","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PCManticore/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PCManticore/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PCManticore/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PCManticore/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PCManticore/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PCManticore/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PCManticore/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PCManticore/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PCManticore/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pylint-dev/pylint/issues/1058/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pylint-dev/pylint/issues/1058/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
