toyed with the idea of adjusting the scoring such that larger amounts of issues result in a score that becomes closer and closer to 0 while keeping scores rated 5 and above by the current algorithm the same.  I've arrived at [10( (x^a + 1)^(1/a) - x)](https://www.desmos.com/calculator/1frsbnwoid), loosely based on how Minkowski distance works, where x is the density of issues and a is a taper factor.  4 seems to be a good value for a.\r\n\r\nI guess a function like this could be added\r\n```py\r\ndef taper_score(x, a):\r\n    \"\"\"Turns a value going from 0 to infinity into a score from 10 to 0\r\n\r\n    Starts off linear with the relation 10 - 10 * x and gradually turns\r\n    into an exponential fall off, with a sharpness determined by a.\r\n\r\n    Increasing the parameter a gives a sharper taper, and as a goes\r\n    to infinity this function converges to max(10 - 10 * x, 0).\r\n    \"\"\"\r\n    return 10 * (x ** a + 1) ** (1 / a) - 10 * x\r\n```\r\nAnd then update the scoring expression to\r\n```py\r\ntaper_score((5 * error + warning + refactor + convention) / statement, 4.0)\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut I don't really see a difference between your code being rated `0.1/10.0` instead of`-24/10.0`.

will result in a lower score.\r\n\r\n### Current behavior\r\n\r\nThe removal of the unused import will result in a lower score.\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\n\r\nRemoving a fault should result in an increased score. Unfortunately we rely on the number of statements as a factor which will affect the result in the aforementioned example as the number of statements decreased after fixing the issue.\r\n\r\n\r\n### pylint --version output\r\nAny version has this behaviour including 2.4.2\r\n\r\nRelated is https://github.com/PyCQA/pylint/issues/2399 which aims to remove the negative score as it's not very

Do folks really have CI pipelines where the passing scores is negative and a score 0.0 will unexpectedly pass?\r\n\r\nOne argument for doing this in v2.13.0 is that we merged #5521 -- now a run with a fatal error can score higher than a negative score.","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pylint-dev/pylint/issues/comments/999985291/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"jacobtylerwalls","id":38668450,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4NjY4NDUw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/38668450?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jacobtylerwalls","html_url":"https://github.com/jacobtylerwalls","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jacobtylerwalls/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jacobtylerwalls/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jacobtylerwalls/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jacobtylerwalls/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jacobtylerwalls/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jacobtylerwalls/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jacobtylerwalls/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jacobtylerwalls/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jacobtylerwalls/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":5808525176,"node_id":"UNLE_lADOAtdnV84U0O8qzwAAAAFaNw94","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pylint-dev/pylint/issues/events/5808525176","actor":{"login":"Pierre-Sassoulas","id":5493666,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0OTM2NjY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5493666?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pierre-Sassoulas","html_url":"https://github.com/Pierre-Sassoulas","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pierre-Sassoulas/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pierre-Sassoulas/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pierre-Sassoulas/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pierre-Sassoulas/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pierre-Sassoulas/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pierre-Sassoulas/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pierre-Sassoulas/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pierre-Sassoulas/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pierre-Sassoulas/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"unlabeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-12-23T08:10:21Z","label":{"name":"Breaking

This could affect more than the score and could also be the philosophy behind a kind of guide to what should be done next for a particular user instead of just dumping thousands of messages on their legacy code base. We made a pretty lengthy comments chain about the next step in gamification of pylint with @cdce8p in the last MR before a release and rather stupidly I did not create an issue with the discussion.

feature |\r\n\r\n## Description\r\n\r\nChange the default score formula to use a floor of 0. Negative scores are still supported, on an opt-in basis. Users can set `evaluation=` in their pylint rc to get the old behavior. (Or to get the new behavior if they have an old rc file!)\r\n\r\nCloses #2399 (*)\r\n\r\n(*) Of course, the issue could be kept open for further discussion, but at least the negative part is solved. Better defaults and gamification and nifty scoring formulas could tracked elsewhere (e.g. #3512 or #746).\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pylint-dev/pylint/issues/5595/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pylint-dev/pylint/issues/5595/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":5812814035,"node_id":"MIE_lADOAtdnV84U0O8qzwAAAAFaeIDT","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pylint-dev/pylint/issues/events/5812814035","actor":{"login":"Pierre-Sassoulas","id":5493666,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0OTM2NjY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5493666?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pierre-Sassoulas","html_url":"https://github.com/Pierre-Sassoulas","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pierre-Sassoulas/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pierre-Sassoulas/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pierre-Sassoulas/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pierre-Sassoulas/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pierre-Sassoulas/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pierre-Sassoulas/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pierre-Sassoulas/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pierre-Sassoulas/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pierre-Sassoulas/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"milestoned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-12-24T07:44:50Z","milestone":{"title":"2.13.0"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":5821774875,"node_id":"CE_lADOAtdnV84U0O8qzwAAAAFbATwb","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pylint-dev/pylint/issues/events/5821774875","actor":{"login":"Pierre-Sassoulas","id":5493666,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0OTM2NjY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5493666?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pierre-Sassoulas","html_url":"https://github.com/Pierre-Sassoulas","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pierre-Sassoulas/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pierre-Sassoulas/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pierre-Sassoulas/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pierre-Sassoulas/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pierre-Sassoulas/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pierre-Sassoulas/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pierre-Sassoulas/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pierre-Sassoulas/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pierre-Sassoulas/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-12-28T15:30:41Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
