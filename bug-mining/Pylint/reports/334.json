Question\n\nI'd like to treat messages like I0021 as warnings in my CI system so that the pylint_runner would return a non-zero exit code.\r\nI have enabled useless-suppression in .pylintrc and on the console I get the I0021 message printed properly.\r\nBut the pylint_runner still returns 0 as exit code so that the CI job does not detect this as a warning/info/error.\r\nIs there a way to let the pylint_runner return non-zero for e.g. enabled I0021 messages?\r\nThanks in advance for any help\n\n### Documentation for future user\n\nCould be added e.g. here : https://pylint.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user_guide/messages/information/useless-suppression.html#useless-suppression-i0021\r\nOr more generic somewhere where the informational messages like I00xx are explained\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No
