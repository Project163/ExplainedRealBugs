The errors are:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nE1101: Instance of 'ExtensionIndex' has no 'tz' member (no-member)\r\nE1101: Instance of 'Index' has no 'tz' member (no-member)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is a bug since `date_range` returns a [`DatetimeIndex`](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.date_range.html) object, which have a [`tz`](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.DatetimeIndex.tz.html) attribute.\r\n\r\n#### Reproduction steps\r\n\r\nCreate a script `index_tz_member.py` with the following lines:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nimport pandas as pd\r\n\r\ndays = pd.date_range(\"2021-08-01\", \"2021-08-31\")\r\nassert days.tz is None\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis bug does not appear if using `pandas==1.2.4`.\r\n\r\nThis bug seems related to https://github.com/PyCQA/pylint/issues/3344\r\n\r\n### Configuration\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Command used\r\n\r\n```shell\r\npylint index_tz_member.py\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Pylint output\r\n\r\n```shell\r\nE1101: Instance of 'ExtensionIndex' has no 'tz' member (no-member)\r\nE1101: Instance of 'Index' has no 'tz' member (no-member)\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\n\r\nNo error being raised by pylint.\r\n\r\n### Pylint version\r\n\r\n```shell\r\npylint 2.10.2\r\nastroid 2.7.2\r\nPython 3.8.10 (default, Jun  2 2021, 10:49:15)\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### OS / Environment\r\n\r\nUbuntu 20.04\r\n\r\n### Additional dependencies\r\n\r\npandas==1.3.2","closed_by":{"login":"clavedeluna","id":112832187,"node_id":"U_kgDOBrmuuw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/112832187?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clavedeluna","html_url":"https://github.com/clavedeluna","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clavedeluna/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clavedeluna/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clavedeluna/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clavedeluna/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clavedeluna/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clavedeluna/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clavedeluna/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clavedeluna/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clavedeluna/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pylint-dev/pylint/issues/4910/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pylint-dev/pylint/issues/4910/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
