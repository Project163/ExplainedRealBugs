seems that when astroid visits the tuple node `key, (name, validate)`, the `newnode` which is produced has `elts` which contain only `name` and `validate` elements (and the key is missing).\r\n\r\nPossibly this is due to recursion on this line where the `visit` method recurses into the `visit_tuple` method again and overwrites the `newnode.elts` which at this point contains the `key` object:\r\nhttps://github.com/PyCQA/astroid/blob/main/astroid/rebuilder.py#L2208\r\n\r\n`elts` assigned here:

properties within ``if`` blocks.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat's New in astroid 2.12.0?\r\n=============================\r\nRelease date: 2022-07-09\r\n\r\n* Fix signal has no ``connect`` member for PySide2 5.15.2+ and PySide6\r\n\r\n  Closes #4040, #5378\r\n\r\n* ``astroid`` now requires Python 3.7.2 to run.\r\n\r\n* Avoid setting a Call as a base for classes created using ``six.with_metaclass()``.\r\n\r\n  Refs PyCQA/pylint#5935\r\n\r\n* Fix detection of builtins on ``PyPy`` 3.9.\r\n\r\n* Fix ``re`` brain on Python ``3.11``.
