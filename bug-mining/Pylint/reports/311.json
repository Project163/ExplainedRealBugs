Current problem\n\nWhen writing a function, you can defeat the point of a PEP 570 positional-only argument (to the left of `/`) if:\r\n- it has a default\r\n- later, there is a variadic positional-or-keyword argument e.g. `**kwargs`\r\n\r\n**GOOD** example (adapted from PEP 570, \"[Semantic Corner Case](https://peps.python.org/pep-0570/#semantic-corner-case)\"):\r\n```python\r\ndef foo(name, /, **kwds):\r\n    return name\r\n```\r\nSee that name is actually positional-only:\r\n```python\r\n>>> foo(name=\"Jacob\")\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n  File \"<stdin>\", line 1, in <module>\r\nTypeError: foo() missing 1 required positional argument: 'name'\r\n```\r\n\r\n**BAD** example:\r\n```python\r\ndef foo(name=\"Sarah\", /, **kwds):\r\n    return name\r\n```\r\n\r\nSee that name is completely ignored:\r\n```python\r\n>>> foo(name=\"Jacob\")\r\n'Sarah'\r\n```\n\n### Desired solution\n\nI suggest a new warning e.g. `defeated-positional-only-argument`\n\n### Additional context\n\nInspired by #8555 \r\n\r\n[PEP 570](https://peps.python.org/pep-0570)","closed_by":{"login":"mbyrnepr2","id":31762852,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxNzYyODUy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/31762852?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbyrnepr2","html_url":"https://github.com/mbyrnepr2","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbyrnepr2/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbyrnepr2/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbyrnepr2/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbyrnepr2/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbyrnepr2/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbyrnepr2/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbyrnepr2/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbyrnepr2/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbyrnepr2/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pylint-dev/pylint/issues/8558/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pylint-dev/pylint/issues/8558/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
