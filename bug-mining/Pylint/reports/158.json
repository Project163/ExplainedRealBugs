Configuration\n\n_No response_\n\n### Command used\n\n```shell\npylint uninitialized_variable_test.py\n```\n\n\n### Pylint output\n\n```shell\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nYour code has been rated at 10.00/10 (previous run: -45.00/10, +55.00)\n```\n\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nShould get an undefined variable error in the same cases in which one would get the error without the variable having been declared but not assigned, OR it should produce a used-before-assignment error.\n\n### Pylint version\n\n```shell\npylint 2.11.1\r\nastroid 2.8.2\r\nPython 3.9.5 (default, Jul 19 2021, 01:21:38) \r\n[GCC 5.4.0 20160609]\n```\n\n\n### OS / Environment\n\nUbuntu 16.04\n\n### Additional dependencies\n\n_No
