 Hi there! Thank you for discovering and submitting an issue.\r\n\r\n  Before you submit this, make sure that the issue doesn't already exist\r\n  or if it is not closed.\r\n\r\n  Is your issue fixed on the preview release?:\r\n    pip install pylint astroid --pre -U\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\n1. Follow the [Documentation](https://pylint.readthedocs.io/en/latest/development_guide/contribute.html#repository) to set up pre-commit hooks\r\n2. Install the requirements defined in ``requirements_test_pre_commit.txt``\r\n3.

This issue would have probably been detected a lot earlier if this is really a bug?\r\n* It seems like I _need_ to install ``pylint`` via ``pip``, as the pre-commit hook tries to run ``pylint`` (and not e.g. ``python -m pylint`` so that it would just use the current state of the local repository). Am I supposed to install ``pylint`` itself into my local development virtual environment? That does not seem clean, I doubt that is the intended way? However, this would apparently be the only solution to get it to work together with VS code and its Git plugin.","closed_by":{"login":"Pierre-Sassoulas","id":5493666,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0OTM2NjY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5493666?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pierre-Sassoulas","html_url":"https://github.com/Pierre-Sassoulas","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pierre-Sassoulas/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pierre-Sassoulas/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pierre-Sassoulas/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pierre-Sassoulas/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pierre-Sassoulas/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pierre-Sassoulas/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pierre-Sassoulas/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pierre-Sassoulas/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pierre-Sassoulas/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pylint-dev/pylint/issues/4306/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pylint-dev/pylint/issues/4306/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
