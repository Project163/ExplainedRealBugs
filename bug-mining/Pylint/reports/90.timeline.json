Description\r\n\r\nBefore that, we had to use strings in a TOML configuration file, like\r\nthis:\r\n\r\n```toml\r\nenable = \"use-symbolic-message-instead,useless-suppression\"\r\njobs = \"10\"\r\nsuggestion-mode = \"no\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nTOML supports rich types like list, integer and boolean. They make for\r\na more readable and less error-prone file. We can now express the same\r\nconfiguration like this:\r\n\r\n```toml\r\nenable = [\r\n    \"use-symbolic-message-instead\",\r\n    \"useless-suppression\",\r\n]\r\njobs = 10\r\nsuggestion-mode = false\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Type of Changes\r\n|   | Type |\r\n| ------------- | ------------- |\r\n| ✓  | :bug: Bug fix  |\r\n\r\n\r\n## Related Issue\r\n\r\nCloses #3538 \r\n\r\n## Tests\r\n\r\nPrevious tests were not quite right because they used `MagicMock`, which happily says yes to, well, whatever you throw at it, including `magic_mocked_thing.called_with(\"anything\", \"really\")`. ;)\r\n\r\n\r\n## Alternative\r\n\r\nI aimed for the least invasive change, but I think that we may be trying too hard to keep using ConfigParser. Here we read TOML files (with rich types such as list), then convert back to strings to shoehorn the values into ConfigParser, then we deserialize again to rich types for final use. I feel like we may want to get rid of ConfigParser.
