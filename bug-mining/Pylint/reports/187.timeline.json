      |\r\n\r\n## Description\r\n\r\n**Before**\r\nIn Pylint 2.13.0 (unreleased) we are starting to be more confident in emitting `used-before-assignment` by making control flow inferences. (See e.g. #5384) We started cautiously, just checking direct parents of statements in try blocks to find out if that was the same `TryExcept` ancestor that was the parent of the node being visited in the except block. This left out possibly failing statements in the try block indented under `if`/`with`, etc.\r\n\r\n**Now**\r\n@DanielNoord suggested using `get_node_first_ancestor_of_type()` to be able to leapfrog over `if` and `with` statements to arrive at the relevant try ancestor. With this PR, we can now emit `used-before-assignment` even when the possibly failing statements in a try block are inside if/with statements.\r\n\r\nOne refactor commit and one behavior change commit.\r\n\r\nCloses #4045\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pylint-dev/pylint/issues/5582/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pylint-dev/pylint/issues/5582/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":5802399812,"node_id":"REFE_lADOAtdnV84vWCq1zwAAAAFZ2ZhE","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pylint-dev/pylint/issues/events/5802399812","actor":{"login":"jacobtylerwalls","id":38668450,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4NjY4NDUw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/38668450?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jacobtylerwalls","html_url":"https://github.com/jacobtylerwalls","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jacobtylerwalls/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jacobtylerwalls/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jacobtylerwalls/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jacobtylerwalls/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jacobtylerwalls/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jacobtylerwalls/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jacobtylerwalls/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jacobtylerwalls/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jacobtylerwalls/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"d16730b1f7a2a783c3ef7f9b1c70d604f40aa7a9","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jacobtylerwalls/pylint/commits/d16730b1f7a2a783c3ef7f9b1c70d604f40aa7a9","created_at":"2021-12-22T03:27:34Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":5868396754,"node_id":"CE_lADOAtdnV84vWCq1zwAAAAFdyKDS","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pylint-dev/pylint/issues/events/5868396754","actor":{"login":"Pierre-Sassoulas","id":5493666,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0OTM2NjY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5493666?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pierre-Sassoulas","html_url":"https://github.com/Pierre-Sassoulas","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pierre-Sassoulas/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pierre-Sassoulas/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pierre-Sassoulas/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pierre-Sassoulas/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pierre-Sassoulas/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pierre-Sassoulas/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pierre-Sassoulas/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pierre-Sassoulas/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pierre-Sassoulas/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-01-10T19:48:15Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":5868396976,"node_id":"REFE_lADOAtdnV84vWCq1zwAAAAFdyKGw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pylint-dev/pylint/issues/events/5868396976","actor":{"login":"Pierre-Sassoulas","id":5493666,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0OTM2NjY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5493666?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pierre-Sassoulas","html_url":"https://github.com/Pierre-Sassoulas","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pierre-Sassoulas/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pierre-Sassoulas/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pierre-Sassoulas/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pierre-Sassoulas/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pierre-Sassoulas/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pierre-Sassoulas/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pierre-Sassoulas/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pierre-Sassoulas/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pierre-Sassoulas/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"83a4b8bdfcf31bc1f690de77794d9268a3c2d5ca","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pylint-dev/pylint/commits/83a4b8bdfcf31bc1f690de77794d9268a3c2d5ca","created_at":"2022-01-10T19:48:17Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pylint-dev/pylint/issues/comments/1040797623","html_url":"https://github.com/pylint-dev/pylint/issues/4045#issuecomment-1040797623","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pylint-dev/pylint/issues/4045","id":1040797623,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAtdnV84-CU-3","user":{"login":"markmark206","id":218696,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxODY5Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/218696?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":

Bug description\n\nThis is related to (but not exactly duplicated by) what is described in https://github.com/PyCQA/pylint/issues/4913 and https://github.com/PyCQA/pylint/issues/4045 .\r\n\r\nHere is an example where a variable is initialized inside a try block, and is used in the except, before it had a chance to be initialized.\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ cat use_before_assignment.py\r\n```\r\n```python\r\ndef compute() -> int:\r\n    raise ValueError(\"bad chickens\")\r\n\r\ndef count_chickens():\r\n    try:\r\n        chicken_count = compute()\r\n    except ValueError:\r\n        print(chicken_count)\r\n\r\ncount_chickens()\r\n```\r\n\r\nif i run this code, i get an error -- as i would expect. \r\n\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ python use_before_assignment.py\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n  File \"/Users/markgenba/src/genba/use_before_assignment.py\", line 6, in count_chickens\r\n    chicken_count = compute()\r\n  File \"/Users/markgenba/src/genba/use_before_assignment.py\", line 2, in compute\r\n    raise ValueError(\"bad chickens\")\r\nValueError: bad chickens\r\n\r\nDuring handling of the above exception, another exception occurred:\r\n\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n  File \"/Users/markgenba/src/genba/use_before_assignment.py\", line 10, in <module>\r\n    count_chickens()\r\n  File

assignment\r\n```\r\n\r\nhowever, pylint doesn't see a problem with the code:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ pylint -d missing-module-docstring,missing-function-docstring use_before_assignment.py\r\n\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nYour code has been rated at 10.00/10 (previous run: 10.00/10, +0.00)\r\n```\n\n### Configuration\n\n_No response_\n\n### Command used\n\n```shell\npylint -d missing-module-docstring,missing-function-docstring use_before_assignment.py\n```\n\n\n### Pylint output\n\n```shell\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nYour code has been rated at 10.00/10 (previous run: 10.00/10, +0.00)\n```\n\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nI would expect pylint to report `used-before-assignment` in the line in the except block where we use the variable that was never initialized: \r\n\r\n```python\r\n        print(chicken_count)\r\n```\r\n\n\n### Pylint version\n\n```shell\npylint 2.12.2\r\nastroid 2.9.3\r\nPython 3.9.9 (v3.9.9:ccb0e6a345, Nov 15 2021, 13:06:05)\r\n[Clang 13.0.0
