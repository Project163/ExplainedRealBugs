This means that, as in my case, it fails to import the custom checker as it cannot find it in the path.\r\nThis first attempt at importing, _crucially_, is the only time that pylint tries to call `register`. It will never attempt to register a plugin module of the same name twice, adding their names to a set of ones it has tried, it seems. This means that, even though having the module in a pylintrc file _would work on its own_, specifying it once in the file and once in commandline _will not work_.\r\n\r\nThe reason the module is always being _imported_ though, is that later on, pylint loops through the set of plugin names and attempts to load those modules again. This time, it looks for the `load_configuration` function. I don't define this in my case, so nothing happens, but by this time the current directory _has_ been added to the `sys.path` list, by some init-hook code I have for an unrelated reason, so the module is imported without any trouble by astroid.\r\n\r\nPutting a breakpoint in makes this work in 2 ways:\r\n1. The act of putting a breakpoint in _apparently_ adds the current working directory into the syspath, something I did not know.\r\n2. It _seems_ that the init-hook runs in time for the sys path to be updated for when I cont/step out of the breakpoint ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯\r\n\r\n## Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n1. Create custom checker in current directory.\r\n3. Run `pylint`, supplying `--load_plugins` on command line\r\n4. Observe that your checker is imported but not registered.\r\n5. Add a pylintrc file, where you add your plugin to the `load_plugins` configuration item, and an init-hook to add the current directory to sys.path.\r\n6. Run `pylint`, with no command line plugin arguments\r\n7. Observe that everything works as you expect\r\n\r\n## Happy to Help!\r\n\r\nI'm happy to investigate further, and to contribute documentation, or code, to work around this, but I'd want to make sure I was doing something that was Pylint Approved™️ rather than waste your time with a PR that \"solves\" the \"problem\" in a way that the maintainers would never go for. I don't do enough open source, so here is as good a place to start as any 😄

@daogilvie Thanks for the thorough investigation. I have one question about this though: why can't you install the plugin like a package? As far as I know, running plugins from the current working directory is not something we support. Plugins should be installed like a package (either from a packaging index like `PyPi` or locally using `pip install .`). That way plugins can be discovered in the order that the code is currently doing so.\r\n> \r\n> Is there something that is limiting you from installing the plugin as a package?\r\n\r\nHi @DanielNoord! Nope, there is nothing at all that prevents me from doing that; I just didn't quite realise how much of a strict line that was. The lint is for a specific project, and has little general value outside of it, so was to live in the monorepo for the project. I could adapt the CI toolchain, or install it as another module, or any number of things 😄 \r\n\r\n Re-reading the \"[How to Write a Custom Checker](https://pylint.pycqa.org/en/latest/development_guide/how_tos/custom_checkers.html)\" page again, I see that under [Debugging a Checker](https://pylint.pycqa.org/en/latest/development_guide/how_tos/custom_checkers.html#debugging-a-checker) it does briefly mention installing it as a requirement for testing, and there is a note callout that says you can edit PYTHONPATH or put the file in the checkers folder in the pylint source.\r\nWould it be an acceptable outcome to make this specific thing clearer in the docs? I can open a PR to suggest some wording?\r\n\r\nTo be clear, the confusion I have is that my `init-hook` _adds_ the directory I'm using to the PYTHONPATH: that is literally what I use it for, and is the most common usage according to pylint's own docs. Given that, my expectation was that pylint _should_ be able to load the plugin.\r\nIf this is explicitly not a combination that is supported it is not really a major issue for me; I opened this issue precisely because I thought I was missing something obvious! 😄
