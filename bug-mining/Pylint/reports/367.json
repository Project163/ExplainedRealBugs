For some messages the short message that is displayed is not enough to make explicit what needs to be changed or what is considered wrong.\r\nWith the closure of #5527 and the merge of #5934 we have now set up a system that allows us to do so!\r\nWe have also received the okay from @vald-phoenix to base this additional documentation on their wonderful [pylint-errors](https://github.com/vald-phoenix/pylint-errors) project.\r\n\r\nHowever, now **we need some community help to write this documentation**. If you'd like to help out and help future users of `pylint` understand what `pylint` is telling them, please continue reading.\r\n<details>\r\nTwo examples of how the new documentation is supposed to look like can be seen [here](https://pylint.pycqa.org/en/latest/messages/error/yield-inside-async-function.html) and [here](https://pylint.pycqa.org/en/latest/messages/convention/empty-docstring.html).\r\n\r\nHow to create such pages? The process is quite straightforward.\r\nWithin the `doc/data/messages` directory you can find various subdirectories. These are the letters of the alphabet. Within these directories you will find directories for each message that `pylint` can emit. These directories contain the data from which these pages are build.\r\n\r\nTo help build a new page:\r\n\r\n1. Create a new directory for the message you are working on. For example `doc/data/messages/a/abstract-class-instantiated`.\r\n2. Look at the page for the message in the `pylint-errors` repo. For example [here](https://github.com/vald-phoenix/pylint-errors/blob/master/plerr/errors/basic/E0110.md). If the message is not documented yet you will need to come up with examples yourself.\r\n3. Create a `good.py` document in which you include a short code example that shows of good code that won't trigger the message. You can base this on `pylint-error`.\r\n4. Create a `bad.py` document in which you include a short bad code example. **On the line that is supposed to emit the message please add a `# [abstract-class-instantiated]` comment.** See these [examples](https://github.com/PyCQA/pylint/blob/main/doc/data/messages/y/yield-inside-async-function/bad.py).\r\n5. If necessary create a `pylintrc` file. Here you can include configuration options for `pylint` like loading of optional checkers. See `doc/data/messages/c/confusing-consecutive-elif/pylintrc` for example.\r\n6. If necessary create a `details.rst` file. Here you can place additional details in .rst format that will be displayed on the page. Note that some of the details included on the `pylint-error` pages are already included in our `Message` or `Description` sections.\r\n7. If necessary create a `related.rst` file. Here you can place .rst style links to external sources that are relevant for the message. Generally we do not include the links to `Test Cases` and the `Issue Tracker` that `pylint-error` provides as they can break easily.\r\n8. If you're basing yourself on the work in the `pylint-errors` repo it is appreciated if you add the following line to your commits:\r\n`Co-authored-by: Vladyslav Krylasov <vladyslav.krylasov@gmail.com>` (or any of the other contributors to that project you're basing yourself on!\r\n9. To make sure the code examples are correct, you can run `pytest doc/test_messages_documentation.py`.\r\n10. Create a PR. A changelog entry is not necessary :)\r\n\r\nTwo examples of how to do this can be found in #5934.\r\n\r\nTo make this work somewhat manageable please do not add more than 5 messages in one PR, as otherwise it will be impossible to review the changes correctly.\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n**The big list of messages without any documentation:**\r\nAs of the 2023-09-09.\r\n\r\n- [x] i/invalid-character-carriage-return #9042\r\n- [x] i/invalid-character-nul #9042\r\n- [x] t/typevar-name-incorrect-variance (need a more detailed explanation by a core maintainer)\r\n- [x] c/c-extension-no-member (This one is going to be hard to trigger, not for beginner)\r\n\r\nRelated pull requests:\r\n#5992, #5994, #5995, #6016, #5993, #5996, #6150, #5997, #6026, #6086, #6000, #6088, #6021, #6002, #6090, #6164, #6166, #6020, #6104, #6103, #6167, #6105, #6106, #6107, #6156, #6157, #6131, #6009, #6139, #6083, #6092, #6200, #6203, #6204, #6237, #6159, #6243, #6250, #6115, #6248, #6249, #6339, #6341, #6342, #6343, #6340, #6344, #6345, #6262, #6263, #6264, #6265, #6080, #6079, #6206, #6245, #6205, #6158, #6114, #6114, #6201, #6160, #6149, #6238, #6152, #6153, #6133, #6244, #6230, #6232, #6151, #6247, #6132, #6239, #6240, #6472, #6699, #6679, #6460, #6697, #6630, #6637, #6698, #6472, #6586, #6541, #6472, #6669, #6618, #6690, #6619, #6620, #6621, #6659, #6576, #6574, #6540, #6700, #6590, #6701, #6591, #6583, #6562, #6585 #9042 \r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/pylint-dev/pylint/issues/7897\r\n\r\n(List of related pull request is not exhaustive)","closed_by":{"login":"jacobtylerwalls","id":38668450,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4NjY4NDUw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/38668450?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jacobtylerwalls","html_url":"https://github.com/jacobtylerwalls","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jacobtylerwalls/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jacobtylerwalls/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jacobtylerwalls/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jacobtylerwalls/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jacobtylerwalls/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jacobtylerwalls/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jacobtylerwalls/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jacobtylerwalls/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jacobtylerwalls/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pylint-dev/pylint/issues/5953/reactions","total_count":6,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":6,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pylint-dev/pylint/issues/5953/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
