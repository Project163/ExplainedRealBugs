is a slightly different issue from what @mteiste has seen with #4272 . My issue is with all sections and options defined in `setup.cfg` are processed/loaded, even if those sections are for other tools and unknown to `pylint`.\r\n\r\nThis has the effect of setting pylint's ignore to `D107,D400,D401`.\r\n\r\nGoing through the code, it feels like the problem is somewhere in [option_manager_mixin.py](https://github.com/PyCQA/pylint/blob/c7ac7c0ec339e9a8d105ccac0e59e65cacb79272/pylint/config/option_manager_mixin.py), either at `read_config_line` line [298:299](https://github.com/PyCQA/pylint/blob/c7ac7c0ec339e9a8d105ccac0e59e65cacb79272/pylint/config/option_manager_mixin.py#L298:L299) or at `load_config_file` line [312](https://github.com/PyCQA/pylint/blob/c7ac7c0ec339e9a8d105ccac0e59e65cacb79272/pylint/config/option_manager_mixin.py#L312).\r\n\r\nApparently, Toml files are not affected because the logic is set to read from `content[\"tool\"][\"pylint\"]`.  But for `setup.cfg` there's no `try / except` block, iterating through every section:\r\n\r\n```\r\nif sect.startswith(\"pylint.\"):\r\n\tsect = sect[len(\"pylint.\") :]\r\nif not sect.isupper() and values:\r\n\tparser._sections[sect.upper()] = values\r\n```\r\n\r\nI think `pylint` should filtered / excluded any section that's not part of any pylint group -> `self._mygroups`.\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\nGiven a config file `setup.cfg`\r\n\r\n```\r\n[pylint.master]\r\nignore = migrations\r\n\r\n[flake8]\r\nignore = D107,D400,D401\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Current behavior\r\n\r\nResult of `pylint --generate-rcfile | grep -A2 'ignore='`:\r\n\r\n```\r\nignore=D107,\r\n       D400,\r\n       D401\r\n```\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\n\r\nResult of `pylint --generate-rcfile | grep -A2 'ignore='`:\r\n\r\n```\r\nignore=migrations\r\n```\r\n\r\n### pylint --version output\r\n\r\nResult of `pylint --version` output:\r\n\r\n```\r\npylint 2.7.4\r\nastroid 2.5.3\r\nPython 3.8.5 (default, Sep  3 2020, 21:29:08) [MSC v.1916 64 bit (AMD64)]\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Workaround\r\n\r\nI had to monkey patch https://github.com/PyCQA/pylint/blob/master/pylint/config/option_manager_mixin.py#L308 with\r\n```\r\n        if section not in self._mygroups:\r\n            continue\r\n```\r\n\r\nResulting in:\r\n\r\n```\r\ndef load_config_file(self):\r\n    \"\"\"Dispatch values previously read from a configuration file to each\r\n    options provider)\"\"\"\r\n    parser = self.cfgfile_parser\r\n    for section in parser.sections():\r\n        if section not in self._mygroups:\r\n            continue\r\n        for option, value in parser.items(section):\r\n            try:\r\n                self.global_set_option(option, value)\r\n            except (KeyError, optparse.OptionError):\r\n                continue\r\n```\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pylint-dev/pylint/issues/4371/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pylint-dev/pylint/issues/4371/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":6439907230,"node_id":"REFE_lADOAtdnV84yccIczwAAAAF_2S-e","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pylint-dev/pylint/issues/events/6439907230","actor":{"login":"Pierre-Sassoulas","id":5493666,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0OTM2NjY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5493666?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pierre-Sassoulas","html_url":"https://github.com/Pierre-Sassoulas","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pierre-Sassoulas/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pierre-Sassoulas/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pierre-Sassoulas/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pierre-Sassoulas/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pierre-Sassoulas/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pierre-Sassoulas/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pierre-Sassoulas/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pierre-Sassoulas/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pierre-Sassoulas/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"7f22d2d36b6f820708663e079625c8caf326a545","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Pierre-Sassoulas/pylint/commits/7f22d2d36b6f820708663e079625c8caf326a545","created_at":"2022-04-15T10:45:12Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"actor":{"login":"Pierre-Sassoulas","id":5493666,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0OTM2NjY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5493666?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pierre-Sassoulas","html_url":"https://github.com/Pierre-Sassoulas","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pierre-Sassoulas/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pierre-Sassoulas/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pierre-Sassoulas/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pierre-Sassoulas/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pierre-Sassoulas/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pierre-Sassoulas/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pierre-Sassoulas/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pierre-Sassoulas/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pierre-Sassoulas/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-04-15T10:47:15Z","updated_at":"2022-04-15T10:47:15Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pylint-dev/pylint/issues/6335","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pylint-dev/pylint","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pylint-dev/pylint/issues/6335/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pylint-dev/pylint/issues/6335/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pylint-dev/pylint/issues/6335/events","html_url":"https://github.com/pylint-dev/pylint/pull/6335","id":1205483441,"node_id":"PR_kwDOAtdnV842STe6","number":6335,"title":"Regression
