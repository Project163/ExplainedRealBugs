experiencing this as well on all platforms I tested, Python 3.8 and 3.9, Linux and Windows, and with and without Pre-Commit. The culprit actually appears to be 56fdadb, a commit added directly to master only a few hours before release. The code, a check for a trivial nuisance under a specific run scenario and which did not include a test, assumes that the new home directory already exists, and is executed on file import, before it ever has a chance to be created, and thus crashes pylint. As such, it would appear that it will break running pylint on any machine that has previously run any prior version of Pylint.\r\n\r\nTo work around this until a non-broken version is out, you can delete the old pylint directory from the path specified, and the problem code is never triggered. Ideally, there really should be at least a minimal smoke test for running Pylint when a previous directory was found and the new directory is not yet present, which would have caught this bug. The simplest fix for the issue itself is guarding the block by an additional check for whether `PYLINT_HOME` exists; the only downside is a bit of extra spam in pre-commit on the first pylint run (which shouldn't be visible unless other errors occur)","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pylint-dev/pylint/issues/comments/903035848/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"CAM-Gerlach","id":17051931,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MDUxOTMx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17051931?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/CAM-Gerlach","html_url":"https://github.com/CAM-Gerlach","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CAM-Gerlach/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CAM-Gerlach/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CAM-Gerlach/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CAM-Gerlach/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CAM-Gerlach/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CAM-Gerlach/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CAM-Gerlach/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CAM-Gerlach/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CAM-Gerlach/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":5189263582,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDUxODkyNjM1ODI=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pylint-dev/pylint/issues/events/5189263582","actor":{"login":"AWhetter","id":3090295,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwOTAyOTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3090295?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AWhetter","html_url":"https://github.com/AWhetter","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AWhetter/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AWhetter/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AWhetter/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AWhetter/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AWhetter/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AWhetter/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AWhetter/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AWhetter/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AWhetter/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"0fa1795ff7710bd372ca41abe2a8742c05f5fbce","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AWhetter/pylint/commits/0fa1795ff7710bd372ca41abe2a8742c05f5fbce","created_at":"2021-08-21T02:11:50Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":5189269895,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDUxODkyNjk4OTU=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pylint-dev/pylint/issues/events/5189269895","actor":{"login":"AWhetter","id":3090295,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwOTAyOTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3090295?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AWhetter","html_url":"https://github.com/AWhetter","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AWhetter/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AWhetter/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AWhetter/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AWhetter/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AWhetter/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AWhetter/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AWhetter/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AWhetter/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AWhetter/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"0624dc87f6c31908b382b84d904f035614a15c5d","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/AWhetter/pylint/commits/0624dc87f6c31908b382b84d904f035614a15c5d","created_at":"2021-08-21T02:18:23Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"actor":{"login":"AWhetter","id":3090295,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwOTAyOTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3090295?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AWhetter","html_url":"https://github.com/AWhetter","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AWhetter/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AWhetter/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AWhetter/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AWhetter/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AWhetter/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AWhetter/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AWhetter/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AWhetter/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AWhetter/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-08-21T02:18:39Z","updated_at":"2021-08-21T02:18:39Z","source":{"type":"issue","
