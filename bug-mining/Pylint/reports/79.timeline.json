This will require slight modification to the commands given at\r\ncold.yeticold.com, disc.yeticold.com, warm.yeticold.com,\r\netc... (all of them).\r\n\r\nThe command would be:\r\npy ~/yeticold/initialize.py MODE\r\nwhere MODE is one of the following:\r\nYetiColdPrimary\r\nYetiColdSecondaryCreate\r\nYetiColdSecondaryRecover\r\nYetiHot\r\nYetiWarm\r\nBitcoinCoreOfflinePrimary\r\nBitcoinCoreOfflineSecondary\r\n\r\nInstead of having many files for different paths with substantially the\r\nsame code, all the common code was combined into a single script. The\r\ndifferences were added as switches based on an input argument to the\r\nscript.\r\n\r\nChanged apt-get to apt because apt is suited better for end users and\r\nhas a nice graphical progress bar.\r\n\r\nChanged unattended-upgrade to sudo apt upgrade so it spits out status\r\nupdates.\r\n\r\nError handling for the arguments was included. Where certain commands\r\ncould result in errors printed to the terminal, the stderr output was\r\npassed to /dev/null to keep the terminal free from worrisome errors that\r\nmean nothing to the user.\r\n\r\nThe system bash calls were also modernized with the latest recommended\r\npractice as of Py3.5. This means using subprocess.run wherever possible.\r\nPart of the proper use of this is to the returncode for success or\r\nfailure, and to explicitly check (or not check) for errors in the\r\nexecution of the command. In this case, all are false.\r\nThis is referenced in: https://github.com/PyCQA/pylint/issues/2848\r\n\r\nAlso included are pauses in script execution to allow time for the flask\r\nwebserver to fully load before loading the first html page. This removes\r\nthe need for the user to manually reload the webpage (this comes across\r\nas a broken user experience).\r\n\r\nFinally, originally the many scripts all had the\r\n`snap install network-manager`. This was unnecessary and undesirable for\r\na couple reasons:\r\n1. Only the 2nd machine in YetiCold needs to have the network disabled.\r\n2. In Ubuntu 18 and 20, network-manager is already installed.\r\nThere is no need to install it with SNAP and doing so silently disables\r\nthe network and leaves the user wondering what's wrong. They would need\r\nto reboot in order for the network to work so the installation can\r\ncontinue.\r\n\r\nIn the future, this practice should be reconsidered for a different\r\napproach, even if manual with specific directions and warnings.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/JWWeatherman/yeticold/issues/74/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/JWWeatherman/yeticold/issues/74/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pylint-dev/pylint/issues/comments/684450345","html_url":"https://github.com/pylint-dev/pylint/issues/2848#issuecomment-684450345","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pylint-dev/pylint/issues/2848","id":684450345,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY4NDQ1MDM0NQ==","user":{"login":"sanyassh","id":55579780,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1NTc5Nzgw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55579780?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sanyassh","html_url":"https://github.com/sanyassh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sanyassh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sanyassh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sanyassh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sanyassh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sanyassh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sanyassh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sanyassh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sanyassh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sanyassh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-09-01T06:33:20Z","updated_at":"2020-09-01T06:33:54Z","body":"This feature conflicts with Pycharm check that says \"argument equals to default parameter value\".

Even when I'm ultimately wrong I certainly appreciate being listened to.\r\n\r\n> It isn't a rule book.\r\n\r\nYou're right of course, the Zen isn't gospel -- it's simply a concise and lighthearted way of highlighting certain design considerations. 🙂\r\n\r\nHowever — I do think those are the dominant considerations in this case. In particular, when I see `subprocess.run(args)` during code review, I want to know what happens if the process fails, because I have an internal mental linter that tells me \"warning: that function silently hides errors\". But if I'm tired I might not notice, and even if I do notice, I'd rather a robot have warned the developer about it in advance so it doesn't need to go through a human review cycle. \r\n\r\nAs you rightly point out,\r\n\r\n> Not every process means \"error\" when it exits non-zero.\r\n\r\nLikewise, not all exceptions raised are actually errors (`StopIteration` comes to mind). On the other hand, _very many_ processes do mean mean error when they exit nonzero. So if a subprocess call does silently suppress errors, the code can be clarified by saying \"I actually do intend to do this otherwise risky thing\". My preference would've been that `subprocess.run(check=True)` be the default, but that's not an option (for backward compatibility reasons). But we can write our calls to be either safe (`check=True`) or signposted (`check=False`) -- which, while verbose and unorthodox (passing the default value), is nonetheless the best option under the circumstances. \r\n\r\n","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pylint-dev/pylint/issues/comments/697132339/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"jtrakk","id":43392409,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzMzkyNDA5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/43392409?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtrakk","html_url":"https://github.com/jtrakk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtrakk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtrakk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtrakk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtrakk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtrakk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtrakk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtrakk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtrakk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jtrakk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pylint-dev/pylint/issues/comments/697832336","html_url":"https://github.com/pylint-dev/pylint/issues/2848#issuecomment-697832336","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pylint-dev/pylint/issues/2848","id":697832336,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY5NzgzMjMzNg==","user":{"login":"gpshead","id":68491,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4NDkx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/68491?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpshead","html_url":"https://github.com/gpshead","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpshead/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpshead/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpshead/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpshead/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpshead/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpshead/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpshead/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpshead/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gpshead/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-09-23T18:20:37Z","updated_at":"2020-09-23T18:20:37Z","body":"As a data point: In our internal codebase I see ~150 files passing an explicit `check=False` to `subprocess.run()` and <20 with a `# pylint: disable=subprocess-run-check` (out of thousands of subprocess.run calls, most written before pylint 2.4, roughly half of which seem to have `check=True`) so it seems to be having the intended effect.
