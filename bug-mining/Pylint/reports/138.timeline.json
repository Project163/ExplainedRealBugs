[here](https://github.com/DanielNoord/pylint/blob/main/tests/functional/d/dict_iter_missing_items.py).\r\n\r\n~I wasn't able to implement code for one false positive, but it is pretty estoric: https://github.com/pylint-dev/pylint/issues/3283. I would personally argue that adding this check as preview rule without supporting this specific use case is fine. I did add a \"test\" for it.~ This was implemented.\r\n\r\n## Test Plan\r\n\r\nFollowed the Contributing guide to create tests, hopefully I didn't miss any.\r\nAlso ran CI on my own fork and seemed to be all okay 😄 \r\n\r\n~Edit: the ecosystem check seems a bit all over the place? 😅~ All
