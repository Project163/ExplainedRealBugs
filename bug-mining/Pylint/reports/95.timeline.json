is a follow up to #1927, #2607, and #4072. In Python 3.9, TypedDict was changed from a class to a function with metaclass magic. This change caused worse problems initially (fixed by #4072), but now pylint gives a warning about too few public methods when subclassing TypedDict to create a new type as suggested in the documentation (https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html#typing.TypedDict). A work around is to use one of the alternate TypedDict syntax forms in which TypedDict is used as a function instead of a class.\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\nGiven a file `a.py`:\r\n```python\r\n\"Demo\"\r\nimport typing\r\n\r\n\r\nclass Coordinate(typing.TypedDict):\r\n    \"This is my type\"\r\n    x: float\r\n    y: float\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Current behavior\r\n\r\nResult of `pylint a.py`:\r\n```\r\n************* Module test\r\ntest.py:5:0: R0903: Too few public methods (0/2) (too-few-public-methods)\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nYour code has been rated at 7.50/10 (previous run: 7.50/10, +0.00)\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\n\r\nNo warnings.\r\n\r\n\r\n### pylint --version output\r\n\r\nResult of `pylint --version` output:\r\n```\r\npylint 2.7.2                                                                                  \r\nastroid 2.5.1                                                                                 \r\nPython 3.9.2\r\n```\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pylint-dev/pylint/issues/4180/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pylint-dev/pylint/issues/4180/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
