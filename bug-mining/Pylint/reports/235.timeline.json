I think `discussion` and `proposal` are a different stage than `needs decision`, _but we're getting into semantics._ For me `discussion` and `proposal` signal that there is ongoing exchange of arguments, whereas `needs decision` signals that the discussion has been exhausted and a maintainer just needs to say \"we're going to do this and that\".\r\nSo `discussion` and `proposal` don't necessarily resolve themselves in one release cycle.\r\n\r\nFor example, I don't mind keeping https://github.com/PyCQA/pylint/issues/5701 open a little longer. We won't implement it in `2.15` anyway so there is no rush. https://github.com/PyCQA/pylint/issues/5788 and https://github.com/PyCQA/pylint/issues/5940 on the other hand seem fairly straightforward and just need a final comment from a maintainer on what the next course of action is.\r\n\r\n> Btw slightly related but there's an issue with label suddenly showing `:emoticon:\">` in their short description, do you have an idea why ?\r\n\r\nI think Github might be testing searching on emojis in the label tab?

For me the main benefit of the colours is to quickly grab my attention for issues/PRs where I can be of help. You can easily ignore all colours of all other labels but over time as a maintainer/contributor you'll get used to needing to respond to ``#ffa500``.
