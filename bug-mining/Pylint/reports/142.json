Bug description\r\n\r\nWhen I run pylint for my code in fresh environment (in build server), pylint tells me that it's not able to create cache directory (and files) to ``%localappdata%\\pylint\\pylint\\Cache (Unable to create directory [full path]``).\r\n\r\nNevertheless I get the expected linting results written to a file.\r\n\r\nI was able to reproduce the issue in my environment by upgrading pylint to 2.10.2 and removing pylint folder from ``%localappdata% and .pylint.d folder from %userprofile%``\r\n\r\nIf I have .pylint.d folder in ``%userprofile%``, I'll get message, which tells that .pylint.d is obsolete and ``PYLINTHOME`` now points to ``%localappdata%\\pylint\\pylint\\Cache``. In that case the cache files are stored properly to ``PYLINTHOME``.\r\n\r\nEverything also works in the fresh environment if I create the cache folder ``%localappdata%`` before running pylint.\r\n\r\n### Command used\r\n\r\n```shell\r\npylint file.py\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Pylint output\r\n\r\n```shell\r\nUnable to create directory\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\n\r\nNo error messages\r\n\r\n### Pylint version\r\n\r\n```shell\r\npylint 2.10.2\r\nastroid 2.7.2\r\nPython 3.9.6 (tags/v3.9.6:db3ff76, Jun 28 2021, 15:26:21) [MSC v.1929 64 bit (AMD64)]\r\n```\r\n\r\n### OS / Environment\r\n\r\nWindows 10\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"Pierre-Sassoulas","id":5493666,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0OTM2NjY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5493666?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pierre-Sassoulas","html_url":"https://github.com/Pierre-Sassoulas","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pierre-Sassoulas/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pierre-Sassoulas/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pierre-Sassoulas/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pierre-Sassoulas/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pierre-Sassoulas/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pierre-Sassoulas/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pierre-Sassoulas/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pierre-Sassoulas/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pierre-Sassoulas/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pylint-dev/pylint/issues/4900/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pylint-dev/pylint/issues/4900/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
