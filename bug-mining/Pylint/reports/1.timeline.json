Usually `pylint` figures out a module's location by checking common paths, such as the standard library or the current directory in case it's a local import, and thus it does not have a knob to configure for specifying where to look for modules.\r\n\r\nIf this is related to having an `import-error`, there are multiple things you can try to figure out to see if `pylint` is correct when emitting that error or not:\r\n\r\n- if the module is a C extension, `pylint` won't be capable to find it and load it accordingly. You can pass `--extension-pkg-whitelist=<module name>` to `pylint` to force it to load and import a C extension\r\n- if the module is a Python one, but it's in a non-standard location, there is not much you can do other than ignoring the module altogether, using `--ignored-modules=...`\r\n- if the module is in a standard location but the error is emitted on a submodule, you can check to see if that submodule does anything funky with dynamic features of Python such as import hooks and `globals()` modification\r\n\r\nHope this helps.","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pylint-dev/pylint/issues/comments/547779492/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"PCManticore","id":448166,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0ODE2Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/448166?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/PCManticore","html_url":"https://github.com/PCManticore","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PCManticore/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PCManticore/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PCManticore/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PCManticore/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PCManticore/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PCManticore/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PCManticore/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PCManticore/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PCManticore/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":2754938164,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50Mjc1NDkzODE2NA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pylint-dev/pylint/issues/events/2754938164","actor":{"login":"PCManticore","id":448166,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0ODE2Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/448166?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/PCManticore","html_url":"https://github.com/PCManticore","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PCManticore/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PCManticore/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PCManticore/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PCManticore/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PCManticore/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PCManticore/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PCManticore/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PCManticore/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PCManticore/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-10-30T07:57:04Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2754938172,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50Mjc1NDkzODE3Mg==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pylint-dev/pylint/issues/events/2754938172","actor":{"login":"SheepDomination","id":6827459,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4Mjc0NTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6827459?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SheepDomination","html_url":"https://github.com/SheepDomination","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SheepDomination/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SheepDomination/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SheepDomination/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SheepDomination/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SheepDomination/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SheepDomination/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SheepDomination/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SheepDomination/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SheepDomination/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-10-30T07:57:04Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2754938173,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDI3NTQ5MzgxNzM=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pylint-dev/pylint/issues/events/2754938173","actor":{"login":"SheepDomination","id":6827459,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4Mjc0NTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6827459?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SheepDomination","html_url":"https://github.com/SheepDomination","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SheepDomination/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SheepDomination/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SheepDomination/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SheepDomination/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SheepDomination/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SheepDomination/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SheepDomination/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SheepDomination/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SheepDomination/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false
