Question\n\nThe [Python team for VS Code](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-python) has been working on putting various tools we support behind [LSP](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/) and breaking them out into their own extensions This work is now far enough along that we wanted to share the extension prototypes for your tool with you and see if you had any interest in owning the extension or the Python-based LSP server backing it yourself?\r\n\r\nIf you don't want to take on that responsibility that's totally fine and understandable! If you want to leave the extension to us we would then publish the extension on the [VS Code Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/VSCode) ourselves. We also plan to publish the extension as open source and support the extension for as long as we felt it made sense to based on usage numbers. But due to the difficulty of migrating extension ownership, we wanted to ask early whether you wanted to own the extension from the start? If you did want to own the extension we would give you the code, help you publish to the VS Code Marketplace, and do anything else we can to help you be successful with this.\r\n\r\nWe have attached a zip file to this issue containing a prototype extension to give you an idea of what we are planning. You can download it, extract the `.vsix` file, and then [install the VSIX](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/extension-marketplace#_install-from-a-vsix) to try it out [python-pylint.zip](https://github.com/PyCQA/pylint/files/8051497/python-pylint.zip). This prototype version was built with python 3.10 and bundles pylint v2.12.2 (as fallback if nothing is found in your environment).\r\n\r\nTo be very clear, there's no pressure or expectations from us. We just want to make sure you as a project had an opportunity to own this extension instead of us from the get-go before the extension gained traction.\n\n### Documentation for future user\n\nNothing for now\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pylint-dev/pylint/issues/5796/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pylint-dev/pylint/issues/5796/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
