Current problem\n\nAs I was looking through the pylint code, I noticed that there were three TODO's that are about pylint version 2.16.\r\n\r\nI thought that it would be good to add that information as an issue\r\n\r\nThe TODO's and locations are:\r\n\r\n- \"pylint/checkers/variables.py\": # TODO: 2.16: Consider using RefactoringChecker._is_function_def_never_returning\r\n- \"pylint/reporters/json_reporter.py\": TODO: 2.16: Add a new JSONReporter handling abs-path, confidence and scores. (Ultimately all other breaking change related to json for 3.0)\r\n- \"script/fix_documentation.py\": # TODO: 2.16.0: Upgrade script for change in changelog\n\n### Desired solution\n\n1. The TODO's are fixed\r\n2. The TODO's have an issue that discuss them that are added to a miletone for a pylint version that is 2.16.x\r\n3. The TODO's are moved to be done in a later version\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_","closed_by":{"login":"Pierre-Sassoulas","id":5493666,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0OTM2NjY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5493666?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pierre-Sassoulas","html_url":"https://github.com/Pierre-Sassoulas","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pierre-Sassoulas/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pierre-Sassoulas/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pierre-Sassoulas/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pierre-Sassoulas/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pierre-Sassoulas/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pierre-Sassoulas/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pierre-Sassoulas/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pierre-Sassoulas/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pierre-Sassoulas/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pylint-dev/pylint/issues/8335/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pylint-dev/pylint/issues/8335/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
