Current problem\n\nI very much like `unspecified-encoding` for enforcing the encoding parameter when using `open`, however it does not seem to work with the more modern way of writing to files through `pathlib`, which also has an encoding argument.\r\n\r\nHere is an example\r\n```python\r\nfrom pathlib import Path\r\n\r\n\r\ndef open_test() -> None:\r\n    with open(\"some_file\") as open_file:\r\n        print(open_file.read())\r\n\r\n\r\ndef read_text_test() -> None:\r\n    print(Path(\"some_file\").read_text())\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen running the following command, only the `open` call without encoding will be detected by pylint.\r\n```\r\n$ pylint ./test_pylint_pathlib.py --disable missing-module-docstring --disable missing-function-docstring\r\n************* Module test_pylint_pathlib\r\ntest_pylint_pathlib.py:5:9: W1514: Using open without explicitly specifying an encoding (unspecified-encoding)\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nYour code has been rated at 8.33/10 (previous run: 8.33/10, +0.00)\r\n\r\n```\n\n### Desired solution\n\nI want calls to [`pathlib.Path.write_text()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pathlib.html#pathlib.Path.read_text) / [`pathlib.Path.read_text()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pathlib.html#pathlib.Path.read_text) to also be detected by pylint.\r\n\r\nBasically something like this as output of the code above:\r\n```\r\n$ pylint ./test_pylint_pathlib.py --disable missing-module-docstring --disable missing-function-docstring\r\n************* Module test_pylint_pathlib\r\ntest_pylint_pathlib.py:5:9: W1514: Using open without explicitly specifying an encoding (unspecified-encoding)\r\ntest_pylint_pathlib.py:10:28: W1514: Using read_text without explicitly specifying an encoding (unspecified-encoding)\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nYour code has been rated at 8.33/10 (previous run: 8.33/10, +0.00)\r\n\r\n```\n\n### Additional
