you for opening an issue.\n\nThe reason for 1) (the current constraint that the checker class must be taking the first 2 digits wasting 100 msgids even if it implements 4 messages in total, that I would personally be happy to get rid off) and 2) were discussed in #5275\n\nRegarding, 3), it could make sense for plugins and increase their msgids' pool. Allowing every letters in pylint itself is hard as there is an ordering of messages F > E > W > C > R, that could complicate things a lot if we change it and want to stay coherent. We could add some letters in pylint core after careful consideration but I don't see how \"D\" for documentation could elegantly insert itself in the current system as \"convention\" or \"refactor\" are higher level concepts.","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pylint-dev/pylint/issues/comments/2798863374/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"Pierre-Sassoulas","id":5493666,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0OTM2NjY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5493666?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pierre-Sassoulas","html_url":"https://github.com/Pierre-Sassoulas","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pierre-Sassoulas/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pierre-Sassoulas/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pierre-Sassoulas/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pierre-Sassoulas/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pierre-Sassoulas/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pierre-Sassoulas/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pierre-Sassoulas/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pierre-Sassoulas/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pierre-Sassoulas/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pylint-dev/pylint/issues/comments/2798915025","html_url":"https://github.com/pylint-dev/pylint/issues/10341#issuecomment-2798915025","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pylint-dev/pylint/issues/10341","id":2798915025,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAtdnV86m1A3R","user":{"login":"offbynull","id":6354978,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzNTQ5Nzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6354978?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/offbynull","html_url":"https://github.com/offbynull","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/offbynull/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/offbynull/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/offbynull/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/offbynull/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/offbynull/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/offbynull/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/offbynull/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/offbynull/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/offbynull/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-04-12T17:22:29Z","updated_at":"2025-04-12T17:22:29Z","body":"Thanks.
