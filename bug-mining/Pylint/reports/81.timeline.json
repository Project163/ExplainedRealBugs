Question\r\n\r\nThe ```logging-fstring-interpolation (W1203)``` warning [reads](http://pylint.pycqa.org/en/latest/technical_reference/features.html?highlight=w1203):\r\n\r\n```\r\n  | Use % formatting in logging functions and pass the % parameters as arguments \r\nUsed when a logging statement has a call form of \"logging.<logging method>\r\n(format_string.format(format_args...))\". Such calls should use % formatting instead, \r\nbut leave interpolation to the logging function by passing the parameters as arguments.\r\nThis message is emitted if f-string was used, and it can be disabled if you like.\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt's not clear to me from that paragraph if its recommended to still use the formatting operator in logging statements, or if f-strings should be used.  My understanding is the original intent of W1203 was to prefer the formatting operator over calls to `format()` as then the string interpolation is done lazily.  I'm guessing the same is true with f-strings correct?  Ie F-strings would not be evaluated lazily, so the same reasons for preferring the formatting operator over `.format()` with log statements apply, and as such the same warning is emitted when f-strings are used with log statements.\r\n\r\nIs that correct?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pylint-dev/pylint/issues/2354/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pylint-dev/pylint/issues/2354/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"actor":{"login":"pzelnip","id":414933,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQxNDkzMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/414933?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pzelnip","html_url":"https://github.com/pzelnip","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pzelnip/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pzelnip/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pzelnip/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pzelnip/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pzelnip/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pzelnip/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pzelnip/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pzelnip/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pzelnip/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-08-21T14:44:51Z","updated_at":"2018-08-21T14:44:51Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pylint-dev/pylint/issues/1788","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pylint-dev/pylint","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pylint-dev/pylint/issues/1788/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pylint-dev/pylint/issues/1788/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pylint-dev/pylint/issues/1788/events","html_url":"https://github.com/pylint-dev/pylint/issues/1788","id":283841279,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWUyODM4NDEyNzk=","number":1788,"title":"logging-format-interpolation

#3136 \r\nFixes #2388 \r\n\r\nThe `JobsList` class is a container and manager of requests for updates\r\nof the status of calculation jobs. For each request, it keeps a future\r\nthat it will update in bulk after retrieving the status of all the jobs\r\nthat it manages. This is necessary to ensure that multiple jobs use the\r\nsame update call to scheduler and not all individually, in order to not\r\noverload the scheduler.\r\n\r\nIf the scheduler update call excepts, all the futures were properly\r\nexcepted as well and the internal cache of outstanding requests would be\r\ncleared, before re-raising the exception. The excepted futures would\r\neach be caught by the exponential backoff mechanism and a new request to\r\nupdate the status would be scheduled. This would be registered with the\r\nsame `JobsList` instance, however, the next scheduler update would never\r\nbe called and so the futures would never be resolved, causing the\r\ncalculation jobs to \"hang\" indefinitely.\r\n\r\nThe problem lies in the `_ensure_updating` method. When a new request\r\ncomes in, this is the method that is called first to see if a scheduler\r\nupdate call has already been scheduled. If the case, a new one does not\r\nhave to be scheduled. This is based on whether the `_update_handle`\r\nattribute is defined. This attribute is properly reset after a scheduler\r\nupdate goes through successfully, in the `updating` coroutine after the\r\n`_update_job_info` yields. However, in the case of an exception in that\r\nlast method, the code path that resets the `_update_handle` is never\r\nreached because the exception is re-raised after the job requests cache\r\nis reset. The solution is simply to manually set `_update_handle` to\r\n`None` in the except clause.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/aiidateam/aiida-core/issues/3155/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/aiidateam/aiida-core/issues/3155/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pylint-dev/pylint/issues/comments/510605045","html_url":"https://github.com/pylint-dev/pylint/issues/2395#issuecomment-510605045","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pylint-dev/pylint/issues/2395","id":510605045,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUxMDYwNTA0NQ==","user":{"login":"earonesty","id":50769,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNzY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/50769?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/earonesty","html_url":"https://github.com/earonesty","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/earonesty/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/earonesty/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/earonesty/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/earonesty/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/earonesty/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/earonesty/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/earonesty/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/earonesty/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/earonesty/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-07-11T18:39:03Z","updated_at":"2019-07-11T18:39:03Z","body":"This is a per-project issue.   We're writing a filesystem.   There are certain points in the code where we have TRACE level logging.   These are hit millions of times and interpolation can kill performance.   Even DEBUG level f-strings can slaughter the functioning of low level code.   \r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the readability of f-strings should *generally* be preferred when the number of interpolations isn't significant.

Steps\r\n\r\n- [*] Add yourself to CONTRIBUTORS if you are a new contributor.\r\n- [*] Add a ChangeLog entry describing what your PR does.\r\n- [*] If it's a new feature or an important bug fix, add a What's New entry in `doc/whatsnew/<current release.rst>`.\r\n- [*] Write a good description on what the PR does.\r\n\r\n## Description\r\nThis PR allows users to choose f-strings as an option to format fstrings. To allow this, the `logging-fstring-interpolation` message has been merged into `logging-format-interpolation`, which now raises if any logging string formatting is found that does not match the type specified in the `logging-format-style` option. This option is also now allowed the new value `fstr`.\r\n\r\nDoing it this way, rather than adding a new message to disallow modulo formatting means that users can select only a single way of doing logging string formatting, which may not be desirable. I chose this because if you allow multiple ways of doing string formatting through different messages, it makes it impossible for the messages to give a recommendation on what formatting to change to.\r\n\r\n## Type of Changes\r\n|   | Type |\r\n| ------------- | ------------- |\r\n|    | :bug: Bug fix  |\r\n| ✓  | :sparkles: New feature |\r\n|    | :hammer: Refactoring  |\r\n|    | :scroll:
