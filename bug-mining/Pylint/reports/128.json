I'm trying to ignore a pylint error for a single line and I don't know how it should be done.\r\n\r\nExample use case:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n        if self._wrapper_class is not None:\r\n            data = self._wrapper_class(data)\r\n            [...]\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe `data = ...` line triggers a `not-callable` error I would like to mask.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure how to do that.\r\n\r\nThis triggers a `line-too-long` error, unless I also disable `line-too-long` in the line, which makes it even longer (in my real-life use case, data is a longer word and the line is more than 80 characters):\r\n\r\n```python\r\n        if self._wrapper_class is not None:\r\n            data = self._wrapper_class(data)  # pylint: disable=not-callable\r\n            [...]\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis disables the warning for the whole `if` context:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n        if self._wrapper_class is not None:\r\n            # pylint: disable=not-callable\r\n            data = self._wrapper_class(data)\r\n            [...]\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is functionally correct but a bit too verbose:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n        if self._wrapper_class is not None:\r\n            # pylint: disable=not-callable\r\n            data = self._wrapper_class(data)\r\n            # pylint: enable=not-callable\r\n            [...]\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis was discussed a while ago on [a mailing-list thread](http://python-projects.logilab.narkive.com/P3Cl687J/disabling-warning-for-one-long-line-only-potential-ppylint-bug).\r\n\r\nI guess this is bound to happen as long as the only way to disable a warning for a single line is to add a trailing pragma, especially since pylint supports disable by (long) name rather than (short) code.\r\n\r\nWouldn't it be handy to have some sort of ignore-for-next-statement pragma?\r\n\r\n```python\r\n        if self._wrapper_class is not None:\r\n            # pylint: disable-next=not-callable\r\n            data = self._wrapper_class(data)\r\n            [...]\r\n```","closed_by":{"login":"Pierre-Sassoulas","id":5493666,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0OTM2NjY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5493666?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pierre-Sassoulas","html_url":"https://github.com/Pierre-Sassoulas","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pierre-Sassoulas/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pierre-Sassoulas/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pierre-Sassoulas/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pierre-Sassoulas/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pierre-Sassoulas/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pierre-Sassoulas/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pierre-Sassoulas/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pierre-Sassoulas/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pierre-Sassoulas/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pylint-dev/pylint/issues/1682/reactions","total_count":11,"+1":11,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pylint-dev/pylint/issues/1682/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
