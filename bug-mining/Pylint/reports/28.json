Run pylint on the following code:\n   \n   ``` python\n   def func(num):\n       if num > 1:\n           if num > 2:\n               if num > 3:\n                   if num > 4:\n                       if num > 5:\n                           if num > 6:\n                               print('greater than four')\n   ```\n### Current behavior\n\nNo `too-many-nested-blocks` message appears in report.\n### Expected behavior\n\nI expect to see the line R:  2, 4: Too many nested blocks (6/5) (too-many-nested-blocks).\n\nNote: default level of max nesting is 5, and I haven't modified this. Adding any other block after this one, e.g. \n\n``` python\ndef func(num):\n    if num > 1:\n        if num > 2:\n            if num > 3:\n                if num > 4:\n                    if num > 5:\n                        if num > 6:\n                            print('greater than four')\n    if num == 0:\n        print('zero')\n```\n\nwill cause the message to appear.\n### pylint --version output\n\n```\nNo config file found, using default configuration\npylint 1.6.4,\nastroid 1.4.8\nPython 3.5.1 (v3.5.1:37a07cee5969, Dec  6 2015, 01:38:48) [MSC v.1900 32 bit (Intel)]\n```\n","closed_by":{"login":"PCManticore","id":448166,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0ODE2Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/448166?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/PCManticore","html_url":"https://github.com/PCManticore","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PCManticore/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PCManticore/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PCManticore/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PCManticore/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PCManticore/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PCManticore/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PCManticore/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PCManticore/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PCManticore/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pylint-dev/pylint/issues/1088/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pylint-dev/pylint/issues/1088/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
