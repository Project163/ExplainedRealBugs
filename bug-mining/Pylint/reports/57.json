Add this to a file called test.py\r\n```python\r\n''' Script to lint all code e.g. python '''\r\nimport os\r\nfrom pylint import epylint\r\n\r\ndef lint_pylint():\r\n    ''' Lint all python code with pylint '''\r\n    pylintrc = os.path.join(\"afolder\", \".pylintrc\")\r\n    epylint.py_run(f'afolder -j 0 --rcfile={pylintrc}')\r\n\r\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\r\n    lint_pylint()\r\n```\r\n2. Add a .pylintrc in a directory like: afolder/.pylintrc\r\n3. Run test.py\r\n\r\n### Current behavior\r\nIt cannot handle .pylintrc files on Windows not in the same folder as the command being run. You thus get an error like:\r\n```python\r\n(venv) ~\\Desktop\\projects\\test [master]> python .\\test.py\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n  File \"<string>\", line 1, in <module>\r\n  File \"C:\\Users\\Moo\\Desktop\\projects\\test\\venv\\lib\\site-packages\\pylint\\lint.py\", line 1301, in __init__\r\n    linter.read_config_file()\r\n  File \"C:\\Users\\Moo\\Desktop\\projects\\test\\venv\\lib\\site-packages\\pylint\\config.py\", line 646, in read_config_file\r\n    raise IOError(\"The config file {:s} doesn't exist!\".format(config_file))\r\nOSError: The config file afolder.pylintrc doesn't exist!\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\nFor it to work. The problem can be found in how shlex.split is invoked on Windows. The line here https://github.com/PyCQA/pylint/blob/9dd978aaed0daf852d8caed515b9e4e13f2dfcc7/pylint/epylint.py#L142 could be changed to:\r\n```python\r\noptions = shlex.split(command_options, posix='win' not in sys.platform)\r\n```\r\n\r\n### pylint --version output\r\n```powershell\r\n(venv) ~\\Desktop\\projects\\test [master]> pylint --version\r\nNo config file found, using default configuration\r\npylint 1.8.2,\r\nastroid 1.6.1\r\nPython 3.6.1 (v3.6.1:69c0db5, Mar 21 2017, 18:41:36) [MSC v.1900 64 bit (AMD64)\r\n```\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"PCManticore","id":448166,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0ODE2Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/448166?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/PCManticore","html_url":"https://github.com/PCManticore","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PCManticore/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PCManticore/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PCManticore/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PCManticore/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PCManticore/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PCManticore/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PCManticore/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PCManticore/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PCManticore/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pylint-dev/pylint/issues/1940/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pylint-dev/pylint/issues/1940/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
