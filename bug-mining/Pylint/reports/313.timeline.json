you for submitting a PR to pylint!\r\n\r\nTo ease the process of reviewing your PR, do make sure to complete the following boxes.\r\n\r\n- [ ] Document your change, if it is a non-trivial one.\r\n  - A maintainer might label the issue ``skip-news`` if the change does not need to be in the changelog.\r\n  - Otherwise, create a news fragment with ``towncrier create <IssueNumber>.<type>`` which will be\r\n    included in the changelog. ``<type>`` can be one of the types defined in `./towncrier.toml`.\r\n    If necessary you can write details or offer examples on how the new change is supposed to work.\r\n  - Generating the doc is done with ``tox -e docs``\r\n- [ ] Relate your change to an issue in the tracker if such an issue exists (Refs #1234, Closes #1234)\r\n- [ ] Write comprehensive commit messages and/or a good description of what the PR does.\r\n- [ ] Keep the change small, separate the consensual changes from the opinionated one.\r\n  Don't hesitate to open multiple PRs if the change requires it. If your review is so\r\n  big it requires to actually plan and allocate time to review, it's more likely\r\n  that it's going to go stale.\r\n- [ ] If you used multiple emails or multiple names when

|\r\n\r\n## Description\r\n\r\nPerhaps I should have created an issue for this, but:\r\n\r\nThis is my proposal to remove the import hell from `astroid` and the method assignment we do for the `inference.py` file.\r\nInstead of calling `node.infer()` we would now just call `infer_object(node)`.\r\nThis decouples the nodes and their meta-information from the actual `astroid` magic that needs and uses that information. Next steps would be to change calls in the `astroid` code base and remove `_infer` everywhere.\r\nThe migration in `pylint` seems rather straightforward as there are not that many calls to `infer()` actually.\r\n\r\nI haven't made a news fragment as I'd like to do this after we have finalised the internal transition.\r\n\r\nLet me know what you think guys!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pylint-dev/astroid/issues/2167/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pylint-dev/astroid/issues/2167/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":9449724250,"node_id":"CE_lADOAtdnV85n6PwkzwAAAAIzP1la","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pylint-dev/pylint/issues/events/9449724250","actor":{"login":"mbyrnepr2","id":31762852,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxNzYyODUy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/31762852?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbyrnepr2","html_url":"https://github.com/mbyrnepr2","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbyrnepr2/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbyrnepr2/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbyrnepr2/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbyrnepr2/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbyrnepr2/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbyrnepr2/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbyrnepr2/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbyrnepr2/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbyrnepr2/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2023-06-06T18:57:40Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":9449724543,"node_id":"REFE_lADOAtdnV85n6PwkzwAAAAIzP1p_","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pylint-dev/pylint/issues/events/9449724543","actor":{"login":"mbyrnepr2","id":31762852,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxNzYyODUy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/31762852?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbyrnepr2","html_url":"https://github.com/mbyrnepr2","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbyrnepr2/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbyrnepr2/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbyrnepr2/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbyrnepr2/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbyrnepr2/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbyrnepr2/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbyrnepr2/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbyrnepr2/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbyrnepr2/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"33d3f22b767e4d4c959a7619d6e3c9f7e617e092","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pylint-dev/pylint/commits/33d3f22b767e4d4c959a7619d6e3c9f7e617e092","created_at":"2023-06-06T18:57:42Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":9449727484,"node_id":"REFE_lADOAtdnV85n6PwkzwAAAAIzP2X8","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pylint-dev/pylint/issues/events/9449727484","actor":{"login":"github-actions[bot]","id":41898282,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90NDE4OTgyODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/15368?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/github-actions","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-actions%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"c9989c734dddb3b3dc54ae58cd21f228392a02ef","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pylint-dev/pylint/commits/c9989c734dddb3b3dc54ae58cd21f228392a02ef","created_at":"2023-06-06T18:58:01Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":9450036472,"node_id":"REFE_lADOAtdnV85n6PwkzwAAAAIzRBz4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pylint-dev/pylint/issues/events/9450036472","actor":{"login":"Pierre-Sassoulas","id":5493666,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0OTM2NjY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5493666?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pierre-Sassoulas","html_url":"https://github.com/Pierre-Sassoulas","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pierre-Sassoulas/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pierre-S
