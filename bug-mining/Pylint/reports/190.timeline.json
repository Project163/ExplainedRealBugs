So for instance, the ClassDef is built here [1] and it's using this [2] little helper function to get the docstring. Then the docstring is removed from the nodes body.\r\nSo, this means, that I can just add a new optional argument to the ClassDef constructor which is the original docstring node. This can be done quite similar for FunctionDef I guess. Since everything is optional, it should not break anything. Then in pylint we can just check, if the node has a doc_node attribute.

adds a new attribute `doc_node` to `ClassDef`, `FunctionDef`, `AsyncFunctionDef` and `Module`. This is needed, since some checks in pylint not only need the docstring as a string, but the node containing it.
