Current problem\n\nLiterals should be prioritized over calling their respective constructors because it is clearer. \r\nDemonstrations of new checks:\r\n```py\r\n\"\"\"Incorrect Code\"\"\"\r\nmylist = list((1, 2, 3, 4, 5))  # [use-list-literal]\r\nmytuple = tuple()  # [use-tuple-literal]\r\nmytuple2 = tuple(['foo', 'bar'])  # [use-tuple-literal]\r\nmydict = dict((('a', 1), ('b', 2)))  # [use-dict-literal]\r\nmyset = set(['py', 'lint'])  # [use-set-literal]\r\n```\r\nShould be (Correct code):\r\n```py\r\n\"\"\"Correct Code\"\"\"\r\nmylist = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] \r\nmytuple = ()\r\nmytuple2 = ('foo', 'bar')\r\nmydict = {'a': 1, 'b': 2}\r\nmyset = {'py', 'lint'}\r\n```\r\nFor both of the above pylint gives a rating of 10.0/10.0.\n\n### Desired solution\n\nI propose a couple new checks, or they could all be merged into a `use-literal` instead.\r\nThe list example and dict example should be part of [`use-list-literal`](https://pylint.pycqa.org/en/latest/messages/refactor/use-list-literal.html) and [`use-dict-literal`](https://pylint.pycqa.org/en/latest/messages/refactor/use-dict-literal.html), and the set and tuple examples could be `use-set-literal` and `use-tuple-literal`. I can see some argument against the tuple literal, as it could be confusing in some parentheses-dense situations, but the other checks would almost always (if not always) make things clearer.\n\n### Additional context\n\nSimilar to issue [#4365](https://github.com/PyCQA/pylint/issues/4365) but for `set`, `tuple`, and more complicated expressions.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pylint-dev/pylint/issues/6542/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pylint-dev/pylint/issues/6542/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"actor":{"login":"reidpr","id":1682574,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2ODI1NzQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1682574?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/reidpr","html_url":"https://github.com/reidpr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reidpr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reidpr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reidpr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reidpr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reidpr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reidpr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reidpr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reidpr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reidpr/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-03-22T21:09:57Z","updated_at":"2024-03-22T21:09:57Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hpc/charliecloud/issues/1876","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hpc/charliecloud","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hpc/charliecloud/issues/1876/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hpc/charliecloud/issues/1876/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hpc/charliecloud/issues/1876/events","html_url":"https://github.com/hpc/charliecloud/issues/1876","id":2203327957,"node_id":"I_kwDOAjzgdM6DVB3V","number":1876,"title":"tidy:
