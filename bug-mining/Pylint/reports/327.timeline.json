you for submitting a PR to pylint!\r\n\r\nTo ease the process of reviewing your PR, do make sure to complete the following boxes.\r\n\r\n- [ ] Document your change, if it is a non-trivial one.\r\n  - A maintainer might label the issue ``skip-news`` if the change does not need to be in the changelog.\r\n  - Otherwise, create a news fragment with ``towncrier create <IssueNumber>.<type>`` which will be\r\n    included in the changelog. ``<type>`` can be one of the types defined in `./towncrier.toml`.\r\n    If necessary you can write details or offer examples on how the new change is supposed to work.\r\n  - Generating the doc is done with ``tox -e docs``\r\n- [ ] Relate your change to an issue in the tracker if such an issue exists (Refs #1234, Closes #1234)\r\n- [ ] Write comprehensive

new in Pylint 3.0.0?\r\n---------------------------\r\nRelease date: 2023-10-02\r\n\r\n\r\nBreaking Changes\r\n----------------\r\n\r\n- Enabling or disabling individual messages will now take effect even if an\r\n  ``--enable=all`` or ``disable=all`` follows in the same configuration file\r\n  (or on the command line).\r\n\r\n  This means for the following example, ``fixme`` messages will now be emitted:\r\n\r\n  ```bash\r\n      pylint my_module --enable=fixme --disable=all\r\n  ```\r\n  To regain the prior behavior, remove the superfluous earlier option.\r\n\r\n  Closes #3696 \r\n\r\n- Remove support for launching pylint with Python 3.7.\r\n  Code that supports Python 3.7 can still be linted with the ``--py-version=3.7`` setting.\r\n\r\n  Refs #6306 \r\n\r\n- Disables placed in a ``try`` block now apply to the ``except`` block.\r\n  Previously, they only happened to do so in the presence of an ``else`` clause.\r\n\r\n  Refs #7767\r\n\r\n- `pyreverse` now uses a new default color palette that is more colorblind friendly.\r\n  The color scheme is taken from `Paul Tol's Notes <https://personal.sron.nl/~pault/>`_.\r\n  If you prefer other colors, you can use the `--color-palette` option to specify custom colors.\r\n\r\n  Closes #8251 \r\n\r\n- Everything related to the ``__implements__`` construct was removed. It was based on PEP245\r\n  that was proposed in 2001 and rejected in 2006.\r\n\r\n  The capability from pyreverse to take ``__implements__`` into account when generating diagrams\r\n  was also removed.\r\n\r\n  Refs #8404 \r\n\r\n- ``pyreverse``: Support for the ``.vcg`` output format (Visualization of Compiler Graphs) has been dropped.\r\n\r\n  Closes #8416 \r\n\r\n- The warning when the now useless old pylint cache directory (pylint.d) was\r\n  found was removed. The cache dir is documented in\r\n  `the FAQ <https://pylint.readthedocs.io/en/latest/faq.html#where-is-the-persistent-data-stored-to-compare-between-successive-runs>`_.\r\n\r\n  Refs #8462 \r\n\r\n- Following a deprecation period, ``pylint.config.PYLINTRC`` was removed.\r\n  Use the ``pylint.config.find_default_config_files`` generator instead.\r\n\r\n  Closes #8862 \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChanges requiring user actions\r\n------------------------------\r\n\r\n- The ``invalid-name`` message no longer checks for a minimum length of 3 characters by default.\r\n  (This was an unadvertised commingling of concerns between casing\r\n  and name length, and users regularly reported this to be surprising.)\r\n\r\n  If checking for a minimum length is still desired, it can be regained in two ways:\r\n\r\n  - If you are content with a ``disallowed-name`` message (instead of\r\n    ``invalid-name``), then simply add the option ``bad-names-rgxs=\"^..?$\"``,\r\n    which will fail 1-2 character-long names. (Ensure you enable\r\n    ``disallowed-name``.)\r\n\r\n  - If you would prefer an ``invalid-name`` message to be emitted, or would\r\n    prefer finer-grained control over the circumstances in which messages are\r\n    emitted (classes vs. methods, etc.), then avail yourself of the regex\r\n    options described\r\n    `here <https://pylint.readthedocs.io/en/stable/user_guide/configuration/all-options.html#main-checker>`_.\r\n    (In particular, take note of the commented out options in the \"example\r\n    configuration\" given at the bottom of the section.) The prior regexes can\r\n    be found in the\r\n    `pull request <https://github.com/pylint-dev/pylint/pull/8813>`_\r\n    that removed the length requirements.\r\n\r\n  Closes #2018 \r\n\r\n- The compare to empty string checker (``pylint.extensions.emptystring``) and the compare to\r\n  zero checker (``pylint.extensions.compare-to-zero``) have been removed and their checks are\r\n  now part of the implicit booleaness checker:\r\n\r\n  - ``compare-to-zero`` was renamed ``use-implicit-booleaness-not-comparison-to-zero`` and\r\n    ``compare-to-empty-string`` was renamed ``use-implicit-booleaness-not-comparison-to-string``\r\n    and they now need to be enabled explicitly.\r\n\r\n  - The ``pylint.extensions.emptystring`` and ``pylint.extensions.compare-to-zero`` extensions\r\n    no longer exist and need to be removed from the ``load-plugins`` option.\r\n\r\n  - Messages related to implicit booleaness were made more explicit and actionable.\r\n    This permits to make their likeness explicit and will provide better performance as they\r\n    share most of their conditions to be raised.\r\n\r\n  Closes #6871 \r\n\r\n- epylint was removed. It now lives at: https://github.com/emacsorphanage/pylint.\r\n\r\n  Refs #7737\r\n\r\n- The ``overgeneral-exceptions`` option now only takes fully qualified names\r\n  into account (``builtins.Exception`` not ``Exception``). If you overrode\r\n  this option, you need to use the fully qualified name now.\r\n\r\n  There's still a warning, but it will be removed in 3.1.0.\r\n\r\n  Refs #8411 \r\n\r\n- Following a deprecation period, it's no longer possible to use ``MASTER``\r\n  or ``master`` as configuration section in ``setup.cfg`` or ``tox.ini``. It's bad practice\r\n  to not start a section title with the tool name. Please use ``pylint.main`` instead.\r\n\r\n  Refs #8465\r\n\r\n- Package stats are now printed when running Pyreverse and a ``--verbose`` flag was added to get the original output with parsed modules. You might need to activate the verbose option if you want to keep the old output.\r\n\r\n  Closes #8973 \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNew Features\r\n------------\r\n\r\n- A new ``json2`` reporter has been added. It features a more enriched output that is\r\n  easier to parse and provides more info.\r\n\r\n  Compared to ``json`` the only changes are that messages are now under the ``\"messages\"``\r\n  key and that ``\"message-id\"`` now follows the camelCase convention and is renamed to\r\n  ``\"messageId\"``.\r\n  The new reporter also reports the \"score\" of the modules you linted as defined by the\r\n  ``evaluation`` option and provides statistics about the modules you linted.\r\n\r\n  We encourage users to use the new reporter as the ``json`` reporter will no longer\r\n  be maintained.\r\n\r\n  Closes #4741 \r\n\r\n- In Pyreverse package dependency diagrams, show when a module imports another only for type-checking.\r\n\r\n  Closes #8112 \r\n\r\n- Add new option (``--show-stdlib``, ``-L``) to ``pyreverse``.\r\n  This is similar to the behavior of ``--show-builtin`` in that standard library\r\n  modules are now not included by default, and this option will include them.\r\n\r\n  Closes #8181 \r\n\r\n- Add Pyreverse option to exclude standalone nodes from diagrams with `--no-standalone`.\r\n\r\n  Closes #8476\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNew Checks\r\n----------\r\n\r\n- Added ``DataclassChecker`` module and ``invalid-field-call`` checker to check for invalid dataclasses.field() usage.\r\n\r\n  Refs #5159 \r\n\r\n- Add ``return-in-finally`` to emit a message if a return statement was found in a finally clause.\r\n\r\n  Closes #8260 \r\n\r\n- Add a new checker ``kwarg-superseded-by-positional-arg`` to warn when a function is called with a keyword argument which shares a name with a positional-only parameter and the function contains a keyword variadic parameter dictionary. It may be surprising behaviour when the keyword argument is added to the keyword variadic parameter dictionary.\r\n\r\n  Closes #8558 \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExtensions\r\n----------\r\n\r\n- Add new ``prefer-typing-namedtuple`` message to the ``CodeStyleChecker`` to suggest\r\n  rewriting calls to ``collections.namedtuple`` as classes inheriting from ``typing.NamedTuple``\r\n  on Python 3.6+.\r\n\r\n  Requires ``load-plugins=pylint.extensions.code_style`` and ``enable=prefer-typing-namedtuple`` to be raised.\r\n\r\n  Closes #8660 \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFalse Positives Fixed\r\n---------------------\r\n\r\n- Extend concept of \"function ambiguity\" in ``safe_infer()`` from\r\n  differing number of function arguments to differing set of argument names.\r\n\r\n  Solves false positives in ``tensorflow``.\r\n\r\n  Closes #3613 \r\n\r\n- Fix `unused-argument` false positive when `__new__` does not use all the arguments of `__init__`.\r\n\r\n  Closes #3670 \r\n\r\n- Fix a false positive for ``invalid-name`` when a type-annotated class variable in an ``enum.Enum`` class has no assigned value.\r\n\r\n  Refs #7402 \r\n\r\n- Fix ``unused-import`` false positive for usage of ``six.with_metaclass``.\r\n\r\n  Closes #7506 \r\n\r\n- Fix false negatives and false positives for ``too-many-try-statements``,\r\n  ``too-complex``, and ``too-many-branches`` by correctly counting statements\r\n  under a ``try``.\r\n\r\n  Refs #7767 \r\n\r\n- When checking for unbalanced dict unpacking in for-loops, Pylint will now test whether the length of each value to be\r\n  unpacked matches the number of unpacking targets. Previously, Pylint would test the number of values for the loop\r\n  iteration, which would produce a false unbalanced-dict-unpacking warning.\r\n\r\n  Closes #8156\r\n\r\n- Fix false positive for ``used-before-assignment`` when usage and assignment\r\n  are guarded by the same test in different statements.\r\n\r\n  Closes #8167 \r\n\r\n- Adds ``asyncSetUp`` to the default ``defining-attr-methods`` list to silence\r\n  ``attribute-defined-outside-init`` warning when using\r\n  ``unittest.IsolatedAsyncioTestCase``.\r\n\r\n  Refs #8403 \r\n\r\n- `logging-not-lazy` is not longer emitted for explicitly concatenated string arguments.\r\n\r\n  Closes #8410 \r\n\r\n- Fix false positive for isinstance-second-argument-not-valid-type when union types contains None.\r\n\r\n  Closes #8424 \r\n\r\n- ``invalid-name`` now allows for integers in ``typealias`` names:\r\n  - now valid: ``Good2Name``, ``GoodName2``.\r\n  - still invalid: ``_1BadName``.\r\n\r\n  Closes #8485\r\n\r\n- No longer consider ``Union`` as type annotation as type alias for naming checks.\r\n\r\n  Closes #8487 \r\n\r\n- ``unnecessary-lambda`` no longer warns on lambdas which use its parameters in\r\n  their body (other than the final arguments), e.g.\r\n  ``lambda foo: (bar if foo else baz)(foo)``.\r\n\r\n  Closes #8496 \r\n\r\n- Fixed `unused-import` so that it observes the `dummy-variables-rgx` option.\r\n\r\n  Closes #8500 \r\n\r\n- `Union` typed variables without assignment are no longer treated as\r\n  `TypeAlias`.\r\n\r\n  Closes #8540\r\n\r\n- Allow parenthesized implicitly concatenated strings when `check-str-concat-over-line-jumps` is enabled.\r\n\r\n  Closes #8552. \r\n\r\n- Fix false positive for ``positional-only-arguments-expected`` when a function contains both a positional-only parameter that has a default value, and ``**kwargs``.\r\n\r\n  Closes #8555 \r\n\r\n- Fix false positive for ``keyword-arg-before-vararg`` when a positional-only parameter with a default value precedes ``*args``.\r\n\r\n  Closes #8570 \r\n\r\n- Fix false positive for ``arguments-differ`` when overriding `__init_subclass__`.\r\n\r\n  Closes #8919 \r\n\r\n- Fix a false positive for ``no-value-for-parameter`` when a staticmethod is called in a class body.\r\n\r\n  Closes #9036\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFalse Negatives Fixed\r\n---------------------\r\n\r\n- Emit ``used-before-assignment`` when calling module-level functions before definition.\r\n\r\n  Closes #1144 \r\n\r\n- Apply ``infer_kwarg_from_call()`` to more checks\r\n\r\n  These mostly solve false negatives for various checks,\r\n  save for one false positive for ``use-maxsplit-arg``.\r\n\r\n  Closes #7761 \r\n\r\n- `TypeAlias` variables defined in functions are now checked for `invalid-name` errors.\r\n\r\n  Closes #8536 \r\n\r\n- Fix false negative for ``no-value-for-parameter`` when a function, whose signature contains both a positional-only parameter ``name`` and also ``*kwargs``, is called with a keyword-argument for ``name``.\r\n\r\n  Closes #8559 \r\n\r\n- Fix a false negative for ``too-many-arguments`` by considering positional-only and keyword-only parameters.\r\n\r\n  Closes #8667 \r\n\r\n- Emit ``assignment-from-no-return`` for calls to builtin methods like ``dict.update()``.\r\n  Calls to ``list.sort()`` now raise ``assignment-from-no-return``\r\n  rather than ``assignment-from-none`` for consistency.\r\n\r\n  Closes #8714\r\n  Closes #8810 \r\n\r\n- ``consider-using-augmented-assign`` is now applied to dicts and lists as well.\r\n\r\n  Closes #8959\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOther Bug Fixes\r\n---------------\r\n\r\n- Support ``duplicate-code`` message when parallelizing with ``--jobs``.\r\n\r\n  Closes #374 \r\n\r\n- Support ``cyclic-import`` message when parallelizing with ``--jobs``.\r\n\r\n  Closes #4171 \r\n\r\n- ``--jobs`` can now be used with ``--load-plugins``.\r\n\r\n  This had regressed in astroid 2.5.0.\r\n\r\n  Closes #4874 \r\n\r\n- docparams extension considers type comments as type documentation.\r\n\r\n  Closes #6287\r\n\r\n- When parsing comma-separated lists of regular expressions in the config, ignore\r\n  commas that are inside braces since those indicate quantifiers, not delineation\r\n  between expressions.\r\n\r\n  Closes #7229 \r\n\r\n- The ``ignored-modules`` option will now be correctly taken into account for ``no-name-in-module``.\r\n\r\n  Closes #7578 \r\n\r\n- ``sys.argv`` is now always correctly considered as impossible to infer (instead of\r\n  using the actual values given to pylint).\r\n\r\n  Closes #7710 \r\n\r\n- Avoid duplicative warnings for unqualified exception names in the ``overgeneral-exceptions``\r\n  setting when running with ``--jobs``.\r\n\r\n  Closes #7774 \r\n\r\n- Don't show class fields more than once in Pyreverse diagrams.\r\n\r\n  Closes #8189 \r\n\r\n- Fix ``used-before-assignment`` false negative when TYPE_CHECKING imports\r\n  are used in multiple scopes.\r\n\r\n  Closes #8198 \r\n\r\n- ``--clear-cache-post-run`` now also clears LRU caches for pylint utilities\r\n  holding references to AST nodes.\r\n\r\n  Closes #8361 \r\n\r\n- Fix a crash when ``TYPE_CHECKING`` is used without importing it.\r\n\r\n  Closes #8434\r\n\r\n- Fix a ``used-before-assignment`` false positive when imports\r\n  are made under the ``TYPE_CHECKING`` else if branch.\r\n\r\n  Closes #8437 \r\n\r\n- Fix a regression of ``preferred-modules`` where a partial match was used instead of the required full match.\r\n\r\n  Closes #8453 \r\n\r\n- Fix a crash in pyreverse when \"/\" characters

the linter stats for messages relating\r\n  to the linter itself (e.g. ``unknown-option-value``), fixing\r\n  problems with score, fail-on, etc.\r\n\r\n  Closes #9059\r\n\r\n- Fix crash in refactoring

and #2079\r\n\r\n- Search for ``pyproject.toml`` recursively in parent directories up to a project or file system root.\r\n\r\n  Refs #7163, Closes #3289 \r\n\r\n- All code related to the optparse config parsing has been removed.\r\n\r\n  Refs #8405 \r\n\r\n- Pylint now supports python 3.12.\r\n\r\n  Refs #8718\r\n\r\n- Add a CITATION.cff file to the root of the repository containing the necessary metadata to cite Pylint.\r\n\r\n  Closes #8760\r\n\r\n- Renamed the \"unneeded-not\" error into \"unnecessary_negation\" to be clearer.\r\n\r\n  Closes #8789\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInternal Changes\r\n----------------\r\n\r\n- ``get_message_definition`` was removed from the base checker API. You can access\r\n  message definitions through the ``MessageStore``.\r\n\r\n  Refs #8401 \r\n\r\n- Everything related to the ``__implements__`` construct was removed. It was based on PEP245\r\n  that was proposed in 2001 and rejected in 2006.\r\n\r\n  All the classes inheriting ``Interface`` in ``pylint.interfaces`` were removed.\r\n  ``Checker`` should only inherit ``BaseChecker`` or any of the other checker types\r\n  from ``pylint.checkers``. ``Reporter`` should only inherit ``BaseReporter``.\r\n\r\n  Refs #8404 \r\n\r\n- ``modname`` and ``msg_store`` are now required to be given in ``FileState``.\r\n  ``collect_block_lines`` has also been removed. ``Pylinter.current_name``\r\n  cannot be null anymore.\r\n\r\n  Refs #8407 \r\n\r\n- ``Reporter.set_output`` was removed in favor of ``reporter.out = stream``.\r\n\r\n  Refs #8408 \r\n\r\n- A number of old utility functions and classes have been removed:\r\n\r\n  ``MapReduceMixin``: To make a checker reduce map data simply implement\r\n  ``get_map_data`` and ``reduce_map_data``.\r\n\r\n  ``is_inside_lambda``: Use ``utils.get_node_first_ancestor_of_type(x, nodes.Lambda)``\r\n\r\n  ``check_messages``: Use ``utils.only_required_for_messages``\r\n\r\n  ``is_class_subscriptable_pep585_with_postponed_evaluation_enabled``: Use\r\n  ``is_postponed_evaluation_enabled(node)`` and ``is_node_in_type_annotation_context(node)``\r\n\r\n  ``get_python_path``: assumption that there's always an __init__.py is not true since\r\n  python 3.3 and is causing problems, particularly with PEP 420. Use ``discover_package_path``\r\n  and pass source root(s).\r\n\r\n  ``fix_import_path``: Use ``augmented_sys_path`` and pass additional ``sys.path``\r\n  entries as an argument obtained from ``discover_package_path``.\r\n\r\n  ``get_global_option``: Use ``checker.linter.config`` to get all global options.\r\n\r\n  Related private objects have been removed as well.\r\n\r\n  Refs #8409 \r\n\r\n- ``colorize_ansi`` now only accepts a ``MessageStyle`` object.\r\n\r\n  Refs #8412 \r\n\r\n- Following a deprecation period, ``Pylinter.check`` now only works with sequences of strings, not strings.\r\n\r\n  Refs #8463 \r\n\r\n- Following a deprecation period, ``ColorizedTextReporter`` only accepts ``ColorMappingDict``.\r\n\r\n  Refs #8464\r\n\r\n- Following a deprecation period, ``MessageTest``'s ``end_line`` and ``end_col_offset``\r\n  must be accurate in functional tests (for python 3.8 or above on cpython, and for\r\n  python 3.9 or superior on pypy).\r\n\r\n  Refs #8466 \r\n\r\n- Following a deprecation period, the ``do_exit`` argument of the ``Run`` class (and of the ``_Run``\r\n  class in testutils) were removed.\r\n\r\n  Refs #8472 \r\n\r\n- Following a deprecation period, the ``py_version`` argument of the\r\n  ``MessageDefinition.may_be_emitted`` function is now required. The most likely solution\r\n  is to use 'linter.config.py_version' if you need to keep using this\r\n  function, or to use 'MessageDefinition.is_message_enabled' instead.\r\n\r\n  Refs #8473 \r\n\r\n- Following a deprecation period, the ``OutputLine`` class now requires\r\n  the right number of argument all the time. The functional output can be\r\n  regenerated automatically to achieve that easily.\r\n\r\n  Refs #8474 \r\n\r\n- Following a deprecation period, ``is_typing_guard``, ``is_node_in_typing_guarded_import_block`` and\r\n  ``is_node_in_guarded_import_block`` from ``pylint.utils`` were removed: use a combination of\r\n  ``is_sys_guard`` and ``in_type_checking_block`` instead.\r\n\r\n  Refs #8475 \r\n\r\n- Following a deprecation period, the ``location`` argument of the\r\n  ``Message`` class must now be a ``MessageLocationTuple``.\r\n\r\n  Refs #8477\r\n\r\n- Following a deprecation period, the ``check_single_file`` function of the\r\n  ``Pylinter`` is replaced by ``Pylinter.check_single_file_item``.\r\n\r\n  Refs #8478 \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPerformance Improvements\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\n- ``pylint`` runs (at least) ~5% faster after improvements to ``astroid``\r\n  that make better use of the inference cache.\r\n\r\n  Refs pylint-dev/astroid#529 \r\n\r\n- - Optimize ``is_trailing_comma()``.\r\n  - Cache ``class_is_abstract()``.\r\n\r\n  Refs #1954 \r\n\r\n- Exit immediately if all messages are disabled.\r\n\r\n  Closes #8715\r\n\r\n\r\nCloses #7607 ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pylint-dev/pylint/issues/9093/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pylint-dev/pylint/issues/9093/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
