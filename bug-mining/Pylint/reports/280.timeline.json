think we are starting to confuse things here. In your original post you pointed out an issue with this warning, which we should solve:\r\nNo longer emit this warning for `Enums` as they `self` is always one of their values which are Singletons and thus aren't affected by the issue this warning targets.\r\n\r\nThe rest of this discussion is taking this warning much broader. As far as I see it there is no intent of expanding this warning to also start checking other functions for redundant variables as that is simply too difficult. It just invites you to rewrite methods to no longer use `self` as that can unnecessarily prevent your instances from getting garbage collected. The example in the documentation shows how this could be achieved.\r\nI think scoping this issue to methods decreases the complexity and, while this issue shows it is certainly not perfect, makes it much more manageable and less prone to false positives.
