Given you have Python 2 specific syntax, the parser fails to parse the file, resulting in `syntax-error` not being emitted when you have the `--py3k` mode enabled.\r\n\r\nIdeally we should use a Python 2 specific parser, which we can actually expose via the `typed_ast` module that we use internally: https://github.com/PyCQA/astroid/blob/master/astroid/_ast.py#L26\r\n\r\nRegarding your question on two versions of `pylint`, the issue is that Pylint 2.X is incompatible in terms of code changes with Pylint 1.9.X.

issue is about adding the `pre-commit-hooks.yaml` file to pylint-1.9.5 version. \r\nI know this issue has been fixed in pylint-2.4.0 and above. \r\nHowever, we have a repo in our system that is still on python2 and the highest pylint version that is python2 compatible is 1.9.5. \r\nBefore you say 'you should migrate to python 3', this is exactly why we need this: pylint has the `pylint --py3k` option that will highlight any python2/3 compatibility problems in new code that is being committed, but this **must run on python 2** (otherwise it won't print out any errors, see https://github.com/PyCQA/pylint/issues/2956)\r\n\r\nThis is issue is about retroactively readding the `pre-commit-hooks.yaml` to version 1.9.5.\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\n1. Use pre-commit hooks in a python project specifying python2 language and pylint-1.9.5 version\r\n2. Configure a pre-commit hook such as \r\n```\r\n- repo: https://github.com/PyCQA/pylint\r\n    # latest py2 compatible version\r\n    rev: pylint-1.9.5\r\n    hooks:\r\n      - id: pylint\r\n        name: python2/3 compatibility\r\n        language: python\r\n        # need py2 for the py3 compatibility. If running on py3, check passes even with errors.\r\n        language_version: python2\r\n        args: [--py3k, -r=n, -f=parseable]\r\n        types: [python]\r\n```\r\n3. The `git commit` fails with \r\n```\r\nAn error has occurred: InvalidManifestError:\r\n=====> /Users/tommaso/.cache/pre-commit/repoayufqei0/.pre-commit-hooks.yaml does not exist\r\nCheck the log at /Users/tommaso/.cache/pre-commit/pre-commit.log\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Current behavior\r\n\r\nCannot use pylint-1.9.5 as a hook from another repo's `pre-commit-config.yaml`.\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\n\r\nShould be able to use pylint-1.9.5 as a hook from another repo's `pre-commit-config.yaml`\r\n\r\n### pylint --version output\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pylint-dev/pylint/issues/3485/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":1,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pylint-dev/pylint/issues/3485/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
