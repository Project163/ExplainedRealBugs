working on a bug affecting `pylint`, which uses `astroid`, which uses `typed_ast`:\r\nhttps://github.com/PyCQA/pylint/issues/2610\r\n\r\nWhat troubles me is the `.col_offset` value of a `Str` node containing a non-ASCII character with Latin1 encoding.\r\n\r\nHere is a minimal code example:\r\n```\r\n# coding: latin_1\r\nfrom typed_ast import ast3\r\nprint(ast3.parse(\"'a'+'A'\").body[0].value.right.col_offset)  # print: 4\r\nprint(ast3.parse(\"'à'+'A'\").body[0].value.right.col_offset)  # print: 5\r\n```\r\n\r\nFrom my understanding a \"`é`\" character as a length of 1 in Latin-1:\r\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO/IEC_8859-1#Code_page_layout\r\n\r\nHence, could someone help me understanding why the `.col_offset` is higher in
