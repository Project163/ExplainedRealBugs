https://github.com/PyCQA/pylint/issues/2761\r\n\r\nThis yields now `dict-iter-missing-items`\r\n\r\nif iterate with `mydict.keys()` it yields `consider-iterating-dictonary`\r\n\r\nso there is no way anymore to iterate such a dict without warning or error, with one exception, using items() and casting the values to something like `_` which is ugly, or not unpacking at all in the `for` line.\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\n\r\nRecognize if keys are tuples and dont throw this error\r\n\r\n### pylint --version output\r\n\r\npylint 2.4.4\r\nastroid 2.3.3\r\nPython 3.5.4
