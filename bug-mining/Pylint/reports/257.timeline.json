Current problem\r\n\r\nRight now the primer tests take more than double the time of the next slower tests. Also the CI configuration is duplicated between primer for stdlib and primer for external tests. The choice of repository to check is also arbitrary.\r\n\r\n### Desired solution\r\n\r\n- [x] #5425 > Burst the `primer-external` CI job into multiple jobs to cut down on CI run time\r\n- [x] #5425 >  Remove the duplication in the GitHub action configuration and move `primer` to its own workflow file\r\n- [ ] Clarify the criteria for choosing a repository and update the documentation\r\n- [ ] Remove repositories that are redundant or less useful considering what we already have\r\n- [x] Fixing dependency to a specific commit to be able to cache repository\r\n- [x] Caching of repository for primers\r\n- [x] Remove duplication in primer jobs by using a job template\r\n- [x] #5425 >  Only run when something changes in `pylint` internals or `primer` testutils\r\n- [x] Improve error message on crashes and fatal errors within the primer logs\r\n- [ ] Check and see if CI workflow file can be shortened/improved\r\n\r\n### Additional context\r\n\r\n#5173 ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pylint-dev/pylint/issues/5359/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pylint-dev/pylint/issues/5359/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
