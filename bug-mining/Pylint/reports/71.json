While the code that `try-except-raise` catches is should definitely be refactored, it doesn't actually cause any issues execution-wise (that I know of).\r\n\r\nBecause of this, I'd like to propose that the `try-except-raise` message get demoted to the warning or refactor level. I realize that there has already been a release with `try-except-raise` being considered an error, but I figured I'd propose it anyway since I couldn't find any documentation regarding what is considered a breaking change.\r\n\r\nIs this something that's possible? If so, I'd be more than happy to submit a PR to implement it.\r\n\r\nRelated:\r\n - Initial `try-except-raise` implementation: #1939 \r\n - Issues regarding catching subclasses: #2284, #2302\r\n - Proposed fix for the previous issues: #2308","closed_by":{"login":"PCManticore","id":448166,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0ODE2Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/448166?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/PCManticore","html_url":"https://github.com/PCManticore","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PCManticore/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PCManticore/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PCManticore/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PCManticore/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PCManticore/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PCManticore/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PCManticore/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PCManticore/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PCManticore/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pylint-dev/pylint/issues/2323/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pylint-dev/pylint/issues/2323/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
