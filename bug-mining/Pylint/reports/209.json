Unfortunately, the Github CI run doesn't finish in a reasonable time (i.e. default job timeout).\r\n\r\nThe codebase of the [Diofant](https://github.com/diofant/diofant/) is big, however I think that this check should be reasonably cheap (shouldn't involve AST parsing etc).  Unfortunately, it's not true and I think it's an issue for pylint.  At least, I would appreciate any workaround.\r\n\r\nAFAIR, same is true for 'mixed-line-endings', 'trailing-newlines' and 'trailing-whitespace' checkers.\n\n### Configuration\n\n```ini\nsee the project's pyproject.toml (on the PR's branch)\n```\n\n\n### Command used\n\n```shell\npylint diofant\n```\n\n\n### Pylint output\n\n```shell\nNothing (timeout)\n```\n\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nTests pass.\n\n### Pylint version\n\n```shell\npylint 2.12.2\r\nastroid 2.9.3\r\nPython 3.10.0+ (heads/3.10:045f205ba4, Nov  8 2021, 05:21:54) [GCC 10.2.1 20210110]\n```\n\n\n### OS / Environment\n\n_No response_\n\n### Additional dependencies\n\n_No response_","closed_by":{"login":"Pierre-Sassoulas","id":5493666,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0OTM2NjY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5493666?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pierre-Sassoulas","html_url":"https://github.com/Pierre-Sassoulas","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pierre-Sassoulas/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pierre-Sassoulas/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pierre-Sassoulas/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pierre-Sassoulas/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pierre-Sassoulas/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pierre-Sassoulas/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pierre-Sassoulas/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pierre-Sassoulas/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pierre-Sassoulas/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pylint-dev/pylint/issues/5724/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pylint-dev/pylint/issues/5724/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
