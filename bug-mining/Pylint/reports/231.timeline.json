### Question\r\n> Does Pylint follow any particular versioning scheme when it comes to adding new warning types?\r\n\r\nIn general, new checkers or extensive additions to existing checkers are only added in minor versions. So `2.x`.\r\nFor fixes that remove false positives or negatives we tend to use patch releases (`2.14.x`) as we consider those bug fixes.\r\n\r\n> What (at minimum) is considered to be \"public-interface\" of pylint?\r\n\r\nThis is a constant struggle for us. We tend to go with we believe is the \"standard\" within the Python ecosystem: any function, class or module that is underscored is considered private and can change at any time. All other stuff is \"public\" unless there is an explicit `__all__` variable. In that case `__all__` is determines what is and what isn't public.\r\n\r\n> Somewhere in the documentation, but I don't see any intuitive place for it.\r\n\r\nI agree that at some point we should probably document this. However, we are in the process of adding typing to our codebase and this has shown us a number of issues within our codebase that can only be changed by changing some APIs. These include attributes that are initialized/typed as being optional while they are not, methods that should be in class constructors, etc.\r\nUntil we are sure we have caught all such issues and can release a `3.0` I would be hesitant to document our API.\r\nDocumenting it more clearly from `3.0` onwards would be something that I think we should do!","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pylint-dev/pylint/issues/comments/1134952766/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"DanielNoord","id":13665637,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNjY1NjM3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13665637?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/DanielNoord","html_url":"https://github.com/DanielNoord","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DanielNoord/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DanielNoord/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DanielNoord/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DanielNoord/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DanielNoord/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DanielNoord/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DanielNoord/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DanielNoord/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DanielNoord/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":6663229142,"node_id":"LE_lADOAtdnV85KO54bzwAAAAGNKM7W","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pylint-dev/pylint/issues/events/6663229142","actor":{"login":"jacobtylerwalls","id":38668450,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4NjY4NDUw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/38668450?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jacobtylerwalls","html_url":"https://github.com/jacobtylerwalls","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jacobtylerwalls/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jacobtylerwalls/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jacobtylerwalls/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jacobtylerwalls/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jacobtylerwalls/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jacobtylerwalls/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jacobtylerwalls/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jacobtylerwalls/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jacobtylerwalls/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-05-23T18:10:38Z","label":{"name":"Documentation 📖","color":"d4c5f9"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pylint-dev/pylint/issues/comments/1135013362","html_url":"https://github.com/pylint-dev/pylint/issues/6676#issuecomment-1135013362","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pylint-dev/pylint/issues/6676","id":1135013362,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAtdnV85Dpu3y","user":{"login":"Pierre-Sassoulas","id":5493666,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0OTM2NjY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5493666?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pierre-Sassoulas","html_url":"https://github.com/Pierre-Sassoulas","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pierre-Sassoulas/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pierre-Sassoulas/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pierre-Sassoulas/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pierre-Sassoulas/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pierre-Sassoulas/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pierre-Sassoulas/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pierre-Sassoulas/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pierre-Sassoulas/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pierre-Sassoulas/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-05-23T18:39:07Z","updated_at":"2022-05-23T18:39:07Z","body":"[This](https://github.com/PyCQA/pylint/issues/1650#issuecomment-327223970) is still relevant:\r\n\r\n> Obviously we do not guarantee that linting output won't change.

I don't see myself increasing our maintenance burden threefold by declaring everything public when we document our API later on.

We also have a thousands little thing to do before being able to release 3.0 so if something make pylint a lot better at the cost of a little breaking change for maintainer... my vote will go in favor of a little breaking change instead of doing all the changes we need to do for 3.0.
