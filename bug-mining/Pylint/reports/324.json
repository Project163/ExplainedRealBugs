Pylint-3 barks with the warning about incorrect check for anomalous-backslash-in-string W1401. However, in the documentation for re.sub, it notes that '|' a special character and says \"To match a literal '|', use \\|, or enclose it inside a character class, as in [|]\". I checked and both '\\|' and '[|]' work with python 3.9 (running on rocky 9) but the former gives the above-mentioned warning while the latter passes pylint-3.\r\n\r\nI am using pylint-3 after whatever happened on 04aug23 per dates on documentation just got updated. Running dnf/yum doesn't say I need to update but I might be testing in the middle of a push\r\n\r\nI did not see it in GitHub issues\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nPaul\n\n### Configuration\n\n_No response_\n\n### Command used\n\n```shell\npylint-3\n```\n\n\n### Pylint output\n\n```shell\nCENSUS_household.py:2518:21: W1401: Anomalous backslash in string: '\\|'.
