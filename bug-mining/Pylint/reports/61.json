You want to document what an implementation of the method should return. So W9008 should not be raised.\r\n\r\nWith W9006 I'm less certain. Ideally we would make sure that the docstring documents that the method is abstract, but that may happen in the text so we can't reliably detect it. I think my preference here is that W9006 would not get raised and we allow the user to choose whether to include it or not?\r\n\r\n### pylint --version output\r\n\r\npylint 1.8.2, \r\nastroid 1.6.1\r\nPython 2.7.3 (default, Jul 18 2012, 12:27:09) \r\n[GCC 4.4.6]","closed_by":{"login":"AWhetter","id":3090295,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwOTAyOTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3090295?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AWhetter","html_url":"https://github.com/AWhetter","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AWhetter/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AWhetter/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AWhetter/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AWhetter/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AWhetter/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AWhetter/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AWhetter/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AWhetter/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AWhetter/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pylint-dev/pylint/issues/2044/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pylint-dev/pylint/issues/2044/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
