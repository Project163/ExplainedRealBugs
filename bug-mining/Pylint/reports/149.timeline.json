Do a check for the target_dir string existing before passing\r\n  it on for analysis.\r\n- Return None for DriverManager try-except calls when there is a\r\n  NoMatches exception. This modifies all instantiations of Stevedore's\r\n  DriverManager class.\r\n- Iterate over the dictionary using .items() rather than just the plain\r\n  dictionary.\r\n- Use \"with\" to open files and subprocess pipes. This may result in\r\n  certain errors not being raised, but it is hard to know at this\r\n  point.\r\n\r\nMinor changes:\r\n- Used the \"maxsplit\" argument in __main__.py as we only need the\r\n  first item.\r\n- Used [] rather than list() to initialize lists.\r\n- Specify encoding as 'utf-8' when opening files.\r\n- Update re-raises to explicitly state which exception they are\r\n  re-raising from using \"from\".\r\n- Use \"enumerate\" for looping through list's index while throwing\r\n  out the unused value.\r\n- Suppressed the \"useless-suppression\" message along with\r\n  \"too-many-branches\" suppression due to pylint bug:\r\n  https://github.com/PyCQA/pylint/issues/2366\r\n- Wraped some lines that were too long, except in the HTML format\r\n  file due to the need to keep the literal HTML formatting.\r\n- Updated the year on some modified files.\r\n\r\nSigned-off-by: Nisha K
