SUMMARY\r\n\r\nEnabling one of my all time favorite Pylint checks—`useless-suppression`. I'm not sure why it's not enabled by default, but it's a great check to ensure the code base includes no unnecessary `#pylint: disable=<check>` clutter due either to human error or evolving Pylint logic. \r\n\r\nThe one major caveat is there's a false positive with the `line-too-long` check (https://github.com/PyCQA/pylint/issues/4212) which we need to disable on a per line basis.\r\n\r\n###
