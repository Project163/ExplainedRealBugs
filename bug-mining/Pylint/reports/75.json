Depending on the number of imports/the location of the module this is my preferred way to explicitly import in a flexible way. Not sure how easy this would be to fix since it's import-contextual.\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\n1. Install pylint in a python3.5 virtualenv\r\n2. Generate an rcfile and set ignore-imports=yes\r\n3. Create a.py:\r\n```python\r\n'''a.py'''\r\nfrom os import (\r\n    path,\r\n    pipe,\r\n    popen,\r\n    abort,\r\n)\r\n\r\ndef do_something_else():\r\n    '''Print the dirs'''\r\n    print(dir(path))\r\n    print(dir(pipe))\r\n    print(dir(popen))\r\n    print(dir(abort))\r\n```\r\n\r\n4. Create b.py:\r\n```python\r\n'''b.py'''\r\nfrom os import (\r\n    path,\r\n    pipe,\r\n    popen,\r\n    abort,\r\n)\r\n\r\ndef do_something():\r\n    '''Print the types'''\r\n    print(type(path))\r\n    print(type(pipe))\r\n    print(type(popen))\r\n    print(type(abort))\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Current behavior\r\n\r\n```\r\n(venv)$ pylint a.py b.py\r\n************* Module b\r\nR:  1, 0: Similar lines in 2 files\r\n==a:2\r\n==b:2\r\n    path,\r\n    pipe,\r\n    popen,\r\n    abort,\r\n)\r\n (duplicate-code)\r\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nYour code has been rated at 9.17/10\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\n\r\n```\r\n(venv)$ pylint a.py b.py\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nYour code has been rated at 10.00/10\r\n```\r\n\r\n### pylint --version output\r\npylint 1.7.0, \r\nastroid 1.5.1\r\nPython 3.5.2 (default, Nov 17 2016, 17:05:23) \r\n[GCC 5.4.0 20160609]","closed_by":{"login":"PCManticore","id":448166,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0ODE2Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/448166?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/PCManticore","html_url":"https://github.com/PCManticore","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PCManticore/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PCManticore/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PCManticore/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PCManticore/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PCManticore/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PCManticore/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PCManticore/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PCManticore/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PCManticore/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pylint-dev/pylint/issues/1422/reactions","total_count":4,"+1":4,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pylint-dev/pylint/issues/1422/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
