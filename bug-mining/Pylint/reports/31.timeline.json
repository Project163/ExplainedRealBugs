Steps to reproduce\r\n1. Write a function with two arguments.\r\n2. Write a docstring using the Numpy convention marking the second argument as optional.\r\n\r\n#### Example\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef do_something(param, param2='all'):\r\n    \"\"\"Do something.\r\n\r\n    Parameters\r\n    ----------\r\n    param : str\r\n        Description.\r\n    param2 : str, optional\r\n        Description (the default is 'all').\r\n\r\n    Returns\r\n    -------\r\n    int\r\n        Description.\r\n\r\n    \"\"\"\r\n    print param, param2\r\n    return 1\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote that this is supposed to be a valid docstring in the Numpy style.\r\n\r\n### Current behavior\r\n```\r\n> pylint test.py\r\n************* Module test\r\nW:  4, 0: \"param2\" missing or differing in parameter documentation (missing-param-doc)\r\nW:  4, 0: \"param2\" missing or differing in parameter type documentation (missing-type-doc)\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf I remove the optional flag, the warnings disappear. The warning also happens when using anything other than a single word as parameter type (e.g., list of str) for `param2`. However, if I change `param` type description to optional or anything besides one word, the warning disappears again.\r\n\r\nThis problem does not occur when there is one argument. But if I add one or more arguments, different combinations of the above either succeed or don't.\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\nNo warning at all.\r\n\r\n### pylint --version output\r\n```\r\npylint 1.6.5,\r\nastroid 1.4.9\r\nPython 2.7.13 (v2.7.13:a06454b1afa1, Dec 17 2016, 20:53:40) [MSC v.1500 64 bit (AMD64)]\r\n```\r\nI'm on Windows 10 by the way.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pylint-dev/pylint/issues/1383/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pylint-dev/pylint/issues/1383/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
