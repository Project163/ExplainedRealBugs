It somewhat demotivating to run `pylint` over your project just to get a `-24/10.0` as a score, which would make `pylint` look like a super drastic tool, that's super nitpicky about everything.\r\n\r\nI think we could do a better job here at welcoming everyone to using `pylint`. Instead of having a `0-10` score, we could check if other tools are doing something different and see what works best in general.
