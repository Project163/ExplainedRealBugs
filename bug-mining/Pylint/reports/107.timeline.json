@Pierre-Sassoulas,\r\n\r\nThanks!! \r\n\r\nYou have helped me to diagnose the issue, I have updated the PR to use a context manager for all calls to `open()` and this has resolved the issue.\r\n\r\nThis might also help you diagnose the issue (if you still think there is one), for example the fixtures in the tests now look like:\r\n\r\n```\r\n@pytest.fixture\r\ndef qm_file():\r\n\r\n    with open(\"src/test/resources/example_qm_file.csv\") as qm_file_in:\r\n        qm_file = qm_file_in.read()\r\n\r\n    return qm_file\r\n```\r\n\r\nI am currently replacing the calls which open the test resource files in fixtures in this feature branch and it seems to get further and further, I will feedback if this turns out to be a red herring but it certainly looks to be resolving the
