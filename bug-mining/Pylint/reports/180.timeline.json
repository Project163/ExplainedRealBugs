issued when assigning to attributes.  With\r\n`__setattr__` defined, we cannot infer if it is an error to assign to an\r\nattribute, so we suppress the error.\r\n\r\nFix #3793\r\n\r\nI came across that same behaviour in Qiskit/qiskit-terra#7347, and found the old issue #3793 describing it.  That's marked \"high effort\" whereas this is a very simple patch, so apologies if I've missed some complicating circumstances
