Bug description\r\n\r\nTake the following function:\r\n\r\n```py\r\ndef echo(*args):\r\n    \"\"\"\r\n    Print the given arguments.\r\n    \"\"\"\r\n    print(*args)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe `args` parameter can be added to the docstring (in Sphinx style) in 3 ways:\r\n\r\n1. `:param args: Arguments to print.`\r\n    This works with sphinx and pylint 2.11.1 and earlier (before #5175).  With pylint 2.12.0 and later it causes the following errors\r\n   > echo.py:4:0: W9015: \"*args\" missing in parameter documentation (missing-param-doc)\r\n   > echo.py:4:0: W9017: \"args\" differing in parameter documentation (differing-param-doc)\r\n2. `:param *args: Arguments to print.`\r\n    This works with pylint, but causes the following error with sphinx:\r\n    > echo.py:docstring of echo.echo:3:Inline emphasis start-string without end-string.\r\n3. `:param \\*args: Arguments to print.`\r\n    This works with sphinx, but causes the following error with pylint:\r\n   > W1401: Anomalous backslash in string: '\\*'. String constant might be missing an r prefix. (anomalous-backslash-in-string)\r\n\r\n### Configuration\r\n\r\n```ini\r\n[MASTER]\r\nload-plugins=pylint.extensions.docparams\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Command used\r\n\r\n```shell\r\npylint echo.py\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Pylint output\r\n\r\nFor method 1 (with pylint 2.12.1):\r\n\r\n    echo.py:4:0: W9015: \"*args\" missing in parameter documentation (missing-param-doc)\r\n    echo.py:4:0: W9017: \"args\" differing in parameter documentation (differing-param-doc)\r\n\r\nFor method 2:\r\n\r\nNo errors.\r\n\r\nFor method 3:\r\n\r\n    echo.py:8:11: W1401: Anomalous backslash in string: '\\*'. String constant might be missing an r prefix. (anomalous-backslash-in-string)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\n\r\nI would expect pylint to accept the syntaxes that Sphinx does (1 and 3 from above).\r\n\r\nI'd prefer if pylint rejected syntaxes which Sphinx rejects (2 from above).  However, since Sphinx accepts asterisk-without-backslash for Google- and NumPy-style docstrings (as requested in #3733) if these can't be easily distinguished by pylint, it'd probably be preferable to accept them all.\r\n\r\nNote:  This issue has affected other linters and it was noted that sphinx.ext.napoleon (which adds support for NumPy and Google style docstrings) auto-escapes \\* at the beginning of arguments:  https://github.com/peterjc/flake8-rst-docstrings/issues/18#issuecomment-661040265  This is likely why those styles differ from Sphinx style in what is accepted.\r\n\r\n###

your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**\r\n\r\nIt is not clear to me how to document a star parameter of a variadic function and whether the parameter name should be prefixed with \\*, \\\\\\*, or nothing.  This is particularly true in Sphinx style, but also applies to Google and NumPy styles to some extent (\\*args and \\*\\*kwargs appear in [an example](https://sphinxcontrib-napoleon.readthedocs.io/en/latest/example_google.html), but it's not clear if that's the preferred or only syntax).  This has caused confusion for linters, such as:\r\n\r\n* peterjc/flake8-rst-docstrings#18\r\n* PyCQA/pylint#3733\r\n* PyCQA/pylint#5406\r\n\r\nIt appears that both no-prefix and backslash-star are accepted for Sphinx style, and that all three are accepted for Google and NumPy style (due to auto-escaping in sphinx.ext.napoleon as noted in https://github.com/peterjc/flake8-rst-docstrings/issues/18#issuecomment-661040265 ).  Is this correct?  Are any styles preferred?\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\n\r\nI had checked for examples in both [Describing code in Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/tutorial/describing-code.html#documenting-python-objects) or [The Python Domain](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/restructuredtext/domains.html#info-field-lists).  I'd recommend adding an example to both with the preferred style, and discussing other supported styles in The Python Domain.\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\n\r\nKeeping the status quo is always an option.  We can weigh the current ambiguity and confusion against the effort to write and maintain the docs.\r\n\r\nThanks for considering,\r\nKevin","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sphinx-doc/sphinx/issues/9893/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sphinx-doc/sphinx/issues/9893/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
