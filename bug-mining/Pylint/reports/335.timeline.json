be\r\n    included in the changelog. ``<type>`` can be one of the types defined in `./towncrier.toml`.\r\n    If necessary you can write details or offer examples on how the new change is supposed to work.\r\n  - Generating the doc is done with ``tox -e docs``\r\n- [ ] Relate your change to an issue in the tracker if such an issue exists (Refs #1234, Closes #1234)\r\n- [ ] Write comprehensive commit messages and/or a good description of what the PR does.\r\n- [ ] Keep the change small, separate the consensual changes from the opinionated one.\r\n  Don't hesitate to open multiple PRs if the change requires it. If your review is so\r\n  big it requires to actually plan and allocate time to review, it's more likely\r\n  that it's going to go stale.\r\n- [ ] If you used multiple emails or multiple names when contributing, add your mails\r\n      and preferred name in ``script/.contributors_aliases.json``\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## Type of Changes\r\n\r\n<!-- Leave the corresponding lines for the applicable type of change: -->\r\n\r\n|     | Type                   |\r\n| --- | ---------------------- |\r\n| ✓   | :bug: Bug fix          |\r\n\r\n## Description\r\nAdds clarification in the message for the wrong-import-order check.\r\n\r\nThe original message was confusing, especially when multiple imports were on a single line, because the entire import statement is listed twice in the message (`\"import X, Y, Z\" should be placed before \"import X, Y, Z\"`).\r\n\r\nChanges were made to extract the \"current\" import name and the \"out of order\" import names, and separate them by \"isort order\", so the user is able to clearly see what changes need to be made to address the problem.  For example, `standard import \"X\" should be placed before third order import \"Y\" and first order import \"Z\"`.\r\n\r\nNo functional tests were added, but the output for the wrong-import-order test was updated to reflect the new messages produced by the change.  The code has passed the full `tox` test suite as well as all `primer` tests and a documentation fragment added to explain the changes.\r\n\r\n<!-- If this PR fixes an issue, use the following to

new in Pylint 3.1.0?\r\n---------------------------\r\nRelease date: 2024-02-25\r\n\r\n\r\nNew Features\r\n------------\r\n\r\n- Skip ``consider-using-join`` check for non-empty separators if an ``suggest-join-with-non-empty-separator`` option is set to ``no``.\r\n\r\n  Closes #8701 \r\n\r\n- Discover ``.pyi`` files when linting.\r\n\r\n  These can be ignored with the ``ignore-patterns`` setting.\r\n\r\n  Closes #9097 \r\n\r\n- Check ``TypeAlias`` and ``TypeVar`` (PEP 695) nodes for ``invalid-name``.\r\n\r\n  Refs #9196 \r\n\r\n- Support for resolving external toml files named pylintrc.toml and .pylintrc.toml.\r\n\r\n  Closes #9228 \r\n\r\n- Check for `.clear`, `.discard`, `.pop` and `remove` methods being called on a set while it is being iterated over.\r\n\r\n  Closes #9334 \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNew Checks\r\n----------\r\n\r\n- New message `use-yield-from` added to the refactoring checker. This message is emitted when yielding from a loop can be replaced by `yield from`.\r\n\r\n  Closes #9229. \r\n\r\n- Added a ``deprecated-attribute`` message to check deprecated attributes in the stdlib.\r\n\r\n  Closes #8855 \r\n\r\n\r\nFalse Positives Fixed\r\n---------------------\r\n\r\n- Fixed false positive for ``inherit-non-class`` for generic Protocols.\r\n\r\n  Closes #9106\r\n\r\n- Exempt ``TypedDict`` from ``typing_extensions`` from ``too-many-ancestor`` checks.\r\n\r\n  Refs #9167 \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFalse Negatives Fixed\r\n---------------------\r\n\r\n- Extend broad-exception-raised and broad-exception-caught to except*.\r\n\r\n  Closes #8827 \r\n\r\n- Fix a false-negative for unnecessary if blocks using a different than expected ordering of arguments.\r\n\r\n  Closes #8947. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOther Bug Fixes\r\n---------------\r\n\r\n- Improve the message provided for wrong-import-order check.  Instead of the import statement (\"import x\"), the message now specifies the import that is out of order and which imports should come after it.  As reported in the issue, this is particularly helpful if there are multiple imports on a single line that do not follow the PEP8 convention.\r\n\r\n  The message will report imports as follows:\r\n  For \"import X\", it will report \"(standard/third party/first party/local) import X\"\r\n  For \"import X.Y\" and \"from X import Y\", it will report \"(standard/third party/first party/local) import X.Y\"\r\n  The import category is specified to provide explanation as to why pylint has issued the message and guidence to the developer on how to fix the problem.\r\n\r\n  Closes #8808 \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOther Changes\r\n-------------\r\n\r\n- Print how many files were checked in verbose mode.\r\n\r\n  Closes #8935 \r\n\r\n- Fix a crash when an enum class which is also decorated with a ``dataclasses.dataclass`` decorator is defined.\r\n\r\n  Closes #9100 \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInternal Changes\r\n----------------\r\n\r\n- Update astroid version to 3.1.0.\r\n\r\n  Refs #9457 \r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pylint-dev/pylint/issues/9461/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pylint-dev/pylint/issues/9461/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":11991144603,"node_id":"REFE_lADOAtdnV85qUvxkzwAAAALKulib","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pylint-dev/pylint/issues/events/11991144603","actor":{"login":"netbsd-srcmastr","id":27641251,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3NjQxMjUx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/27641251?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/netbsd-srcmastr","html_url":"https://github.com/netbsd-srcmastr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/netbsd-srcmastr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/netbsd-srcmastr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/netbsd-srcmastr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/netbsd-srcmastr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/netbsd-srcmastr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/netbsd-srcmastr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/netbsd-srcmastr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/netbsd-srcmastr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/netbsd-srcmastr/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"e20c625f3a6abe7f39e63816483dad6c7bb0d200","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/NetBSD/pkgsrc/commits/e20c625f3a6abe7f39e63816483dad6c7bb0d200","created_at":"2024-03-03T20:58:38Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
