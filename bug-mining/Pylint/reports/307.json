Bug description\r\n\r\n`keyword-arg-before-vararg` is emitted by Pylint for the following `a.py` where we have a positional-only parameter with a default value followed by `*args`:\r\n```python\r\ndef name(param1=True, /, *args): ...\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is a false positive because the `keyword-arg-before-vararg` checker exists to warn us about function signatures that can lead to `TypeError: name() got multiple values for argument \"param1\"` when this function would be called with the intention of passing an arbitrary number of *args together with a keyword-argument for `param1`.\r\nHowever, in this case, we have the following, since it isn't possible to pass a positional-only parameter as a keyword anyway:\r\n```python\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n  File \"/Users/markbyrne/programming/a.py\", line 3, in <module>\r\n    name1(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, param1=False)\r\nTypeError: name1() got some positional-only arguments passed as keyword arguments: 'param1'\r\n```\r\n\r\nI propose suppressing the warning in this situation.\r\n\r\n\r\nFor further context on `keyword-arg-before-vararg` see
