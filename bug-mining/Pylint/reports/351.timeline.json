Thanks for bearing with :pray:\r\n\r\n> I understand fixing this may not be on the roadmap, or may not be feasible given the design of astroid, but can we all agree that it is a false positive?\r\n\r\nIt would be a false positive for a linter that's control-flow aware. What if `SomeType.__init__()` calls `function1()` (edited to return something) and assigns the result to `.columns`? Or does that conditionally? Then it's no longer a false positive and pylint got it right. I know I'm changing your hypothetical, so whether we call it a false positive or not, I'm just trying to illuminate the attitude behind the original design we inherited. I agree with you that in the example you supplied here, the message is not helpful.\r\n\r\n***\r\nGiven that, I think you raise a really good usability point about pre-commit. I don't think we've documented anywhere that if you just run pre-commit on your git diff, you're going to get fewer pylint messages _for those specific files_ than you'd get if you linted your whole project. Linting the whole project is impractical for pre-commit, so maybe we need some sort of \"confidence\" level that can allow users to silence diagnostics like the one you've illustrated here.\r\n\r\nI'm open to that, and would be eager to see someone explore the feasibility. If you don't mind, I'd like to retitle the issue to focus this for a contributor who might want to take this up.
