First: Thanks for supporting and maintaining such a great ecosystem!\r\n\r\nMy question: I'm trying to make a simple checker around some custom formatting in log strings. I have followed every tutorial I can find from within the last few years, and naturally looked at the guide [in the documentation](https://pylint.pycqa.org/en/v2.14.5/development_guide/how_tos/custom_checkers.html).\r\n\r\nHowever, I am finding that the `register` function, described as the way to get your checker actually loaded into pylint, simply is not being called. The module is being loaded, for sure — I can see breakpoints in the top level of the module being hit, but not in the `register` function itself. I've tried setting the `--load-plugins` argument, I've tried using the `load_plugins` setting in pylintrc.\r\n\r\nIs there an additional step or constraint missing in the implementation of custom checkers from the docs? Or am I simply making a mistake?\r\n\r\nBelow is the code for my absolute bare-bones first attempt.\r\n\r\nStored in `testchecker.py`:\r\n```python\r\nfrom astroid import nodes\r\nfrom pylint.checkers import BaseChecker\r\n\r\nbreakpoint() # HIT!\r\n\r\nclass SimpleCheck(BaseChecker):\r\n    \"\"\"Simple\"\"\"\r\n    name = \"simple-test-check\"\r\n    msgs = {\r\n            \"W6900\": (\"Test\", \"test-check\", \"Just a test\")\r\n            }\r\n    options = ( (\"fake-option\", {\r\n                \"default\": False,\r\n                \"type\": \"yn\", # EDIT: bool here was not allowed\r\n                \"metavar\": \"<y or n>\",\r\n                \"help\": \"Some fake option\"}\r\n                ),\r\n            )\r\n\r\n    def visit_import(self, _: nodes.Import) -> None:\r\n        breakpoint() # NOT HIT!\r\n\r\ndef register(linter):\r\n    breakpoint() # NOT HIT!\r\n    linter.register_checker(SimpleCheck(linter))\r\n```\r\n\r\nMy file I am linting, `lintme.py`:\r\n```python\r\n\"\"\"MODULE DOCSTRING\"\"\"\r\nimport logging\r\n\r\nlogger = logging.getLogger(__name__)\r\n\r\nlogger.info(\"hello world\")\r\n```\r\nBoth files are in the same directory, in which I execute:\r\n```bash\r\npylint --load-plugins=testchecker lintme.py\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ pylint --version\r\npylint 2.14.5\r\nastroid 2.11.7\r\nPython 3.10.4 (main, May 19 2022, 08:51:27) [Clang 13.1.6 (clang-1316.0.21.2.5)]\r\n$ uname -a\r\nDarwin OVO4941L.ovoenergy.local 21.6.0 Darwin Kernel Version 21.6.0: Sat Jun 18 17:07:25 PDT 2022; root:xnu-8020.140.41~1/RELEASE_X86_64 x86_64\r\n```\r\n\r\nThanks again!\r\n\r\n### Documentation for future user\r\n\r\nI expect the guide to creating a custom checker to contain everything needed to do so, and to have a section highlighting common and easy mistakes (I'm assuming I have made such a mistake)\r\n\r\n### Additional context\r\n\r\nI have searched stack overflow and pre-existing issues on this repo, and not found anyone reporting this.\r\nThere is https://stackoverflow.com/questions/71590677/cant-load-custom-pylint-module, but they report getting an error about not finding the module, then succeeding by placing the module in the pylint source. This is not what I am experiencing.","closed_by":{"login":"DanielNoord","id":13665637,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNjY1NjM3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13665637?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/DanielNoord","html_url":"https://github.com/DanielNoord","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DanielNoord/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DanielNoord/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DanielNoord/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DanielNoord/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DanielNoord/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DanielNoord/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DanielNoord/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DanielNoord/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DanielNoord/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pylint-dev/pylint/issues/7264/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pylint-dev/pylint/issues/7264/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
