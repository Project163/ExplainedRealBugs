Labels like `work in progress`, `waiting on author` and `needs astroid update` now share the same colour so you know as a maintainer that such PRs don't require your attention. Similarly, `needs triage` and `needs review` are now bright yellow and stand out so as a maintainer your attention is immediately drawn to them.\r\nFor PRs I think this already improves the situation somewhat although further improvement are obviously possible.\r\n\r\nFor issues I'd like to also improve our triaging a bit. That's why I would introduce new `Needs PR` and `Needs decision` labels. We wouldn't need to label all existing issue, but can just use them as we encounter relevant cases.\r\n`Needs PR` would cover all cases where there is explicit approval or clear reason for implementation, such as with bug fixes. Notice that for new messages I would say that deciding on a message name would be a prerequisite for the label. \r\n`Needs decision` would cover all issues where a maintainer needs to make a decision, such as approving a message name. \r\n\r\nWe can note some of the labels down in our contributing guidelines and hopefully such explicit labels would help reduce the \"has this been fixed yet?\" comments.
