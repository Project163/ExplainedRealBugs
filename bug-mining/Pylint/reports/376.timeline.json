to complete the following boxes.\r\n\r\n- [x] Document your change, if it is a non-trivial one.\r\n  - A maintainer might label the issue ``skip-news`` if the change does not need to be in the changelog.\r\n  - Otherwise, create a news fragment with ``towncrier create <IssueNumber>.<type>`` which will be\r\n    included in the changelog. ``<type>`` can be one of the types defined in `./towncrier.toml`.\r\n    If necessary you can write details or offer examples on how the new change is supposed to work.\r\n  - Generating the doc is done with ``tox -e docs``\r\n- [x] Relate your change to an issue in the tracker if such an issue exists (Refs #1234, Closes #1234)\r\n- [x] Write comprehensive commit messages and/or a good description of what the PR does.\r\n- [x] Keep the change small, separate the consensual changes from the opinionated one.\r\n  Don't hesitate to open multiple PRs if the change requires it. If your review is so\r\n  big it requires to actually plan and allocate time to review, it's more likely\r\n  that it's going to go stale.\r\n- [x] If you used multiple emails or multiple names when contributing, add your mails\r\n      and preferred name in ``script/.contributors_aliases.json``\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## Type of Changes\r\n\r\n<!-- Leave the corresponding lines for the applicable type of

new in Pylint 4.0.0?\r\n---------------------------\r\nRelease date: 2025-10-12\r\n\r\n- Pylint now supports Python 3.14.\r\n\r\n- Pylint's inference engine (``astroid``) is now much more precise,\r\n  understanding implicit booleanness and ternary expressions. (Thanks @zenlyj!)\r\n\r\nConsider this example:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nclass Result:\r\n    errors: dict | None = None\r\n\r\nresult = Result()\r\nif result.errors:\r\n    result.errors[field_key]\r\n    # inference engine understands result.errors cannot be None\r\n    # pylint no longer raises unsubscriptable-object\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe required ``astroid`` version is now 4.0.0. See the [astroid changelog](https://pylint.readthedocs.io/projects/astroid/en/latest/changelog.html#what-s-new-in-astroid-4-0-0) for additional fixes, features, and performance improvements applicable to pylint.\r\n\r\n- Handling of ``invalid-name`` at the module level was patchy. Now,\r\n  module-level constants that are reassigned are treated as variables and checked\r\n  against ``--variable-rgx`` rather than ``--const-rgx``. Module-level lists,\r\n  sets, and objects can pass against either regex.\r\n\r\nHere, ``LIMIT`` is reassigned, so pylint only uses ``--variable-rgx``:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nLIMIT = 500  # [invalid-name]\r\nif sometimes:\r\n    LIMIT = 1  # [invalid-name]\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf this is undesired, refactor using *exclusive* assignment so that it is\r\nevident that this assignment happens only once:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nif sometimes:\r\n    LIMIT = 1\r\nelse:\r\n    LIMIT = 500  # exclusive assignment: uses const regex, no warning\r\n```\r\n\r\nLists, sets, and objects still pass against either ``const-rgx`` or ``variable-rgx``\r\neven if reassigned, but are no longer completely skipped:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nMY_LIST = []\r\nmy_list = []\r\nMy_List = []  # [invalid-name]\r\n```\r\n\r\nRemember to adjust the [regexes](https://pylint.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user_guide/messages/convention/invalid-name.html) and [allow lists](https://pylint.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user_guide/configuration/all-options.html#good-names) to your liking.\r\n\r\nBreaking Changes\r\n----------------\r\n\r\n- ``invalid-name`` now distinguishes module-level constants that are assigned only once\r\n  from those that are reassigned and now applies ``--variable-rgx`` to the latter. Values\r\n  other than literals (lists, sets, objects) can pass against either the constant or\r\n  variable regexes (e.g. \"LOGGER\" or \"logger\" but not \"LoGgEr\").\r\n\r\n  Remember that ``--good-names`` or ``--good-names-rgxs`` can be provided to explicitly\r\n  allow good names.\r\n\r\n  Closes #3585 \r\n\r\n- The unused ``pylintrc`` argument to ``PyLinter.__init__()`` is deprecated\r\n  and will be removed.\r\n\r\n  Refs #6052 \r\n\r\n- Commented out code blocks such as ``#    bar() # TODO: remove dead code`` will no longer emit ``fixme``.\r\n\r\n  Refs #9255 \r\n\r\n- ``pyreverse`` ``Run`` was changed to no longer call ``sys.exit()`` in its ``__init__``.\r\n  You should now call ``Run(args).run()`` which will return the exit code instead.\r\n  Having a class that always raised a ``SystemExit`` exception was considered a bug.\r\n\r\n  Normal usage of pyreverse through the CLI will not be affected by this change.\r\n\r\n  Refs #9689 \r\n\r\n- The ``suggestion-mode`` option was removed, as pylint now always emits user-friendly hints instead\r\n  of false-positive error messages. You should remove it from your conf if it's defined.\r\n\r\n  Refs #9962 \r\n\r\n- The ``async.py`` checker module has been renamed to ``async_checker.py`` since ``async`` is a Python keyword\r\n  and cannot be imported directly. This allows for better testing and extensibility of the async checker functionality.\r\n\r\n  Refs #10071 \r\n\r\n- The message-id of ``continue-in-finally`` was changed from ``E0116`` to ``W0136``. The warning is\r\n  now emitted for every Python version since it will raise a syntax warning in Python 3.14.\r\n  See `PEP 765 - Disallow return/break/continue that exit a finally block <https://peps.python.org/pep-0765/>`_.\r\n\r\n  Refs #10480 \r\n\r\n- Removed support for ``nmp.NaN`` alias for ``numpy.NaN`` being recognized in ':ref:`nan-comparison`'. Use ``np`` or ``numpy`` instead.\r\n\r\n  Refs #10583 \r\n\r\n- Version requirement for ``isort`` has been bumped to >=5.0.0.\r\n  The internal compatibility for older ``isort`` versions exposed via ``pylint.utils.IsortDriver`` has\r\n  been removed.\r\n\r\n  Refs #10637 \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNew Features\r\n------------\r\n\r\n- ``comparison-of-constants`` now uses the unicode from the ast instead of reformatting from\r\n   the node's values preventing some bad formatting due to ``utf-8`` limitation. The message now uses\r\n   ``\"`` instead of ``'`` to better work with what the python ast returns.\r\n\r\n  Refs #8736 \r\n\r\n- Enhanced pyreverse to properly distinguish between UML relationship types (association, aggregation, composition) based on object ownership semantics. Type annotations without assignment are now treated as associations, parameter assignments as aggregations, and object instantiation as compositions.\r\n\r\n  Closes #9045\r\n  Closes #9267\r\n\r\n- The ``fixme`` check can now search through docstrings as well as comments, by using\r\n  ``check-fixme-in-docstring = true`` in the ``[tool.pylint.miscellaneous]`` section.\r\n\r\n  Closes #9255 \r\n\r\n- The ``use-implicit-booleaness-not-x`` checks now distinguish between comparisons\r\n  used in boolean contexts and those that are not, enabling them to provide more accurate refactoring suggestions.\r\n\r\n  Closes #9353 \r\n\r\n- The verbose option now outputs the filenames of the files that have been checked.\r\n  Previously, it only included the number of checked and skipped files.\r\n\r\n  Closes #9357 \r\n\r\n- colorized reporter now colorizes messages/categories that have been configured as ``fail-on`` in red inverse.\r\n  This makes it easier to quickly find the errors that are causing pylint CI job failures.\r\n\r\n  Closes #9898 \r\n\r\n- Enhanced support for @property decorator in pyreverse to correctly display return types of annotated properties when generating class diagrams.\r\n\r\n  Closes #10057 \r\n\r\n- Add --max-depth option to pyreverse to control diagram complexity. A depth of 0 shows only top-level packages, 1 shows one level of subpackages, etc.\r\n  This helps manage visualization of large codebases by limiting the depth of displayed packages and classes.\r\n\r\n  Refs #10077 \r\n\r\n- Handle deferred evaluation of annotations in Python 3.14.\r\n\r\n  Closes #10149 \r\n\r\n- Enhanced pyreverse to properly detect aggregations for comprehensions (list, dict, set, generator).\r\n\r\n  Closes #10236 \r\n\r\n- ``pyreverse``: add support for colorized output when using output format ``mmd`` (MermaidJS) and ``html``.\r\n\r\n  Closes #10242\r\n\r\n- pypy 3.11 is now officially supported.\r\n\r\n  Refs #10287 \r\n\r\n- Add support for Python 3.14.\r\n\r\n  Refs #10467 \r\n\r\n- Add naming styles for ``ParamSpec`` and ``TypeVarTuple`` that align with the ``TypeVar`` style.\r\n\r\n  Refs #10541 \r\n\r\n\r\nNew Checks\r\n----------\r\n\r\n- Add ``match-statements`` checker and the following message:\r\n  ``bare-name-capture-pattern``.\r\n  This will emit an error message when a name capture pattern is used in a match statement which would make the remaining patterns unreachable.\r\n  This code is a SyntaxError at runtime.\r\n\r\n  Closes #7128 \r\n\r\n- Add new check ``async-context-manager-with-regular-with`` to detect async context managers used with regular ``with`` statements instead of ``async with``.\r\n\r\n  Refs #10408 \r\n\r\n- Add ``break-in-finally`` warning. Using ``break`` inside the ``finally`` clause\r\n  will raise a syntax warning in Python 3.14.\r\n  See `PEP 765 - Disallow return/break/continue that exit a finally block <https://peps.python.org/pep-0765/>`_.\r\n\r\n  Refs #10480 \r\n\r\n- Add new checks for invalid uses of class patterns in :keyword:`match`.\r\n\r\n  * :ref:`invalid-match-args-definition` is emitted if :py:data:`object.__match_args__` isn't a tuple of strings.\r\n  * :ref:`too-many-positional-sub-patterns` if there are more positional sub-patterns than specified in :py:data:`object.__match_args__`.\r\n  * :ref:`multiple-class-sub-patterns` if there are multiple sub-patterns for the same attribute.\r\n\r\n  Refs #10559\r\n\r\n- Add additional checks for suboptimal uses of class patterns in :keyword:`match`.\r\n\r\n  * :ref:`match-class-bind-self` is emitted if a name is bound to ``self`` instead of\r\n    using an ``as`` pattern.\r\n  * :ref:`match-class-positional-attributes` is emitted if a class pattern has positional\r\n    attributes when keywords could be used.\r\n\r\n  Refs #10586\r\n\r\n- Add a ``consider-math-not-float`` message. ``float(\"nan\")`` and ``float(\"inf\")`` are slower\r\n  than their counterpart ``math.inf`` and ``math.nan`` by a factor of 4 (notwithstanding\r\n  the initial import of math) and they are also not well typed when using mypy.\r\n  This check also catches typos in float calls as a side effect.\r\n\r\n  The :ref:`pylint.extensions.code_style` need to be activated for this check to work.\r\n\r\n  Refs #10621 \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFalse Positives Fixed\r\n---------------------\r\n\r\n- Fix a false positive for ``used-before-assignment`` when a variable defined under\r\n  an ``if`` and via a named expression (walrus operator) is used later when guarded\r\n  under the same ``if`` test.\r\n\r\n  Closes #10061 \r\n\r\n- Fix :ref:`no-name-in-module` for members of ``concurrent.futures`` with Python 3.14.\r\n\r\n  Closes #10632 \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFalse Negatives Fixed\r\n---------------------\r\n\r\n- Fix false negative for ``used-before-assignment`` when a ``TYPE_CHECKING`` import is used as a type annotation prior to erroneous usage.\r\n\r\n  Refs #8893 \r\n\r\n- Match cases are now counted as edges in the McCabe graph and will increase the complexity accordingly.\r\n\r\n  Refs #9667\r\n\r\n- Check module-level constants with type annotations for ``invalid-name``.\r\n  Remember to adjust ``const-naming-style`` or ``const-rgx`` to your liking.\r\n\r\n  Closes #9770 \r\n\r\n- Fix false negative where function-redefined (E0102) was not reported for functions with a leading underscore.\r\n\r\n  Closes #9894 \r\n\r\n- We now raise a ``logging-too-few-args`` for format string with no\r\n  interpolation arguments at all (i.e. for something like ``logging.debug(\"Awaiting process %s\")``\r\n  or ``logging.debug(\"Awaiting process {pid}\")``). Previously we did not raise for such case.\r\n\r\n  Closes #9999 \r\n\r\n- Fix false negative for ``used-before-assignment`` when a function is defined inside a ``TYPE_CHECKING`` guard block and used later.\r\n\r\n  Closes #10028 \r\n\r\n- Fix a false negative for ``possibly-used-before-assignment`` when a variable is conditionally defined\r\n  and later assigned to a type-annotated variable.\r\n\r\n  Closes #10421 \r\n\r\n- Fix false negative for ``deprecated-module`` when a ``__import__`` method is used instead of ``import`` sentence.\r\n\r\n  Refs #10453 \r\n\r\n- Count match cases for ``too-many-branches`` check.\r\n\r\n  Refs #10542 \r\n\r\n- Fix false-negative where :ref:`unused-import` was not reported for names referenced in a preceding ``global`` statement.\r\n\r\n  Refs #10633 \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOther Bug Fixes\r\n---------------\r\n\r\n- When displaying unicode with surrogates (or other potential ``UnicodeEncodeError``),\r\n  pylint will now display a '?' character (using ``encode(encoding=\"utf-8\", errors=\"replace\")``)\r\n  instead of crashing. The functional tests classes are also updated to handle this case.\r\n\r\n  Closes #8736 \r\n\r\n- Fixed unidiomatic-typecheck only checking left-hand side.\r\n\r\n  Closes #10217\r\n\r\n- Fix a crash caused by malformed format strings when using ``.format`` with keyword arguments.\r\n\r\n  Closes #10282 \r\n\r\n- Fix false positive ``inconsistent-return-statements`` when using ``quit()`` or ``exit()`` functions.\r\n\r\n  Closes #10508 \r\n\r\n- Fix a crash in :ref:`nested-min-max` when using ``builtins.min`` or ``builtins.max``\r\n  instead of ``min`` or ``max`` directly.\r\n\r\n  Closes #10626 \r\n\r\n- Fixed a crash in :ref:`unnecessary-dict-index-lookup` when the index of an enumerated list\r\n  was deleted inside a for loop.\r\n\r\n  Closes #10627 \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOther Changes\r\n-------------\r\n\r\n- Remove support for launching pylint with Python 3.9.\r\n  Code that supports Python 3.9 can still be linted with the ``--py-version=3.9`` setting.\r\n\r\n  Refs #10405\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInternal Changes\r\n----------------\r\n\r\n- Modified test framework to allow for different test output for different Python versions.\r\n\r\n  Refs #10382 ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pylint-dev/pylint/issues/10639/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":1,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pylint-dev/pylint/issues/10639/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":20249332349,"node_id":"REFE_lADOAtdnV87AANm7zwAAAAS29Ep9","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pylint-dev/pylint/issues/events/20249332349","actor":{"login":"luketainton","id":22561713,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNTYxNzEz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22561713?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/luketainton","html_url":"https://github.com/luketainton","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luketainton/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luketainton/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luketainton/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luketainton/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luketainton/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luketainton/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luketainton/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luketainton/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luketainton/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"d658a4c92ec0701e5d2caae3d1db0bd8c427abcb","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/luketainton/roboluke-tasks/commits/d658a4c92ec0701e5d2caae3d1db0bd8c427abcb","created_at":"2025-10-13T14:48:46Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":20250480728,"node_id":"REFE_lADOAtdnV87AANm7zwAAAAS3BdBY","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pylint-dev/pylint/issues/events/20250480728","actor":{"login":"luketainton","id":22561713,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNTYxNzEz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22561713?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/luketainton","html_url":"https://github.com/luketainton","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luketainton/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luketainton/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luketainton/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luketainton/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luketainton/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luketainton/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luketainton/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luketainton/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luketainton/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"0d25349582e2e47852bbe0f0b899a644cc943e6a","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/luketainton/epage/commits/0d25349582e2e47852bbe0f0b899a644cc943e6a","created_at":"2025-10-13T15:44:41Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
