If so, my apologies.\r\n\r\nI am running rocky9.2 (as in bug-for-bug copy of Linux Red Hat 9.2) and their installation is 3.9 (/bin/python3 is a symlink to /bin/python3.9). Their installation of pylint is 3.9 (/bin/pylint-3 is a symlink to /bin/pylint-3.9). Obviously, pylint-3 --version info of pylint 2.13.7 bears little or no relationship to their naming convention ... which appears to be focused on version matching everything to \"3.9\".\r\n\r\nRather than trying to install a second version of material in a local directory, I just decided to write you an example program.

You suggested \"(r'\\|', [...]\" which I appreciate but don't understand what the 'r' means. I have a workaround using '[|]' which I understand how it is being parsed.
