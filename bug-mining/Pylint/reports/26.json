For instance, something like this won't emit unused-variable:\n\n``` python\nbase, ext = os.path.splitext(...)\nif ext not in ...:\n    pass\n```\n\nWhile this is good by default, in some cases we need more control. We should add a new flag, something of `--global-unused` or sorts, that could check unused variables at the global level.\n","closed_by":{"login":"PCManticore","id":448166,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0ODE2Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/448166?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/PCManticore","html_url":"https://github.com/PCManticore","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PCManticore/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PCManticore/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PCManticore/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PCManticore/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PCManticore/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PCManticore/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PCManticore/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PCManticore/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PCManticore/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pylint-dev/pylint/issues/919/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pylint-dev/pylint/issues/919/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
