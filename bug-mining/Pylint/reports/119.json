From what I can tell (I don't do C or C++), this directory is storing data. \r\n\r\nThe problem with this is, quite simply, that data storage has a designated spot. The `$HOME/.local/share/<PROGRAM_NAME>` folder. This is a part of the [XDG Base Directory Specification](https://specifications.freedesktop.org/basedir-spec/basedir-spec-latest.html). A system that designates the folders for specific things like cached files (`$HOME/.cache/<PROGRAM_NAME>`), configuration files (`$HOME/.config/<PROGRAM_NAME>`), and data files (`$HOME/.local/share/<PROGRAM_NAME>`), among other things. The point is to keep user home directories clean and the user sane. \r\n\r\nThis should be pretty easy to implement. Simply change the variables/constants for where these files are made and stored to the appropriate directory. Simple as that, even for a large codebase (if it was done right).
