new in Pylint 3.2.0?\r\n---------------------------\r\nRelease date: 2024-05-14\r\n\r\n\r\nNew Features\r\n------------\r\n\r\n- Understand `six.PY2` and `six.PY3` for conditional imports.\r\n\r\n  Closes #3501\r\n\r\n- A new `github` reporter has been added. This reporter  returns the output of `pylint` in a format that\r\n  Github can use to automatically annotate code. Use it with `pylint --output-format=github` on your Github Workflows.\r\n\r\n  Closes #9443. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNew Checks\r\n----------\r\n\r\n- Add check ``possibly-used-before-assignment`` when relying on names after an ``if/else``\r\n  switch when one branch failed to define the name, raise, or return.\r\n\r\n  Closes #1727 \r\n\r\n- Checks for generators that use contextmanagers that don't handle cleanup properly.\r\n  Is meant to raise visibilty on the case that a generator is not fully exhausted and the contextmanager is not cleaned up properly.\r\n  A contextmanager must yield a non-constant value and not handle cleanup for GeneratorExit.\r\n  The using generator must attempt to use the yielded context value `with x() as y` and not just `with x()`.\r\n\r\n  Closes #2832\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFalse Negatives Fixed\r\n---------------------\r\n\r\n- If and Try nodes are now checked for useless return statements as well.\r\n\r\n  Closes #9449. \r\n\r\n- Fix false negative for ``property-with-parameters`` in the case of parameters which are ``positional-only``, ``keyword-only``, ``variadic positional`` or ``variadic keyword``.\r\n\r\n  Closes #9584 \r\n\r\n\r\nFalse Positives Fixed\r\n--------------------\r\n\r\n- pylint now understands the ``@overload`` decorator return values better.\r\n\r\n  Closes #4696\r\n  Refs #9606\r\n\r\nPerformance Improvements\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n- Ignored modules are now not checked at all, instead of being checked and then\r\n  ignored. This should speed up the analysis of large codebases which have\r\n  ignored modules.\r\n\r\n  Closes #9442 \r\n\r\n- ImportChecker's logic has been modified to avoid context files when possible. This makes it possible\r\n  to cache module searches on astroid and reduce execution times.\r\n\r\n  Refs #9310. \r\n\r\n- An internal check for ``trailing-comma-tuple`` being enabled for a file or not is now\r\n  done once per file instead of once for each token.\r\n\r\n  Refs #9608.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pylint-dev/pylint/issues/9619/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pylint-dev/pylint/issues/9619/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"actor":{"login":"Splines","id":37160523,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3MTYwNTIz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/37160523?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Splines","html_url":"https://github.com/Splines","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Splines/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Splines/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Splines/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Splines/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Splines/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Splines/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Splines/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Splines/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Splines/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-08-06T09:33:54Z","updated_at":"2024-08-06T09:33:54Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/resultwizard/ResultWizard/issues/53","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/resultwizard/ResultWizard","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/resultwizard/ResultWizard/issues/53/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/resultwizard/ResultWizard/issues/53/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/resultwizard/ResultWizard/issues/53/events","html_url":"https://github.com/resultwizard/ResultWizard/issues/53","id":2450414709,"node_id":"I_kwDOKkMDM86SDlx1","number":53,"title":"Upgrade
