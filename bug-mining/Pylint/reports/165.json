Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\nPylint the following code:\r\n```python3\r\nimport math\r\n\r\n\r\nclass Point:\r\n    def __init__(self, x: float, y: float):\r\n        self.x = x\r\n        self.y = y\r\n\r\n    def distance_to(self, other: Point) -> float:\r\n        x_diff = self.x - other.x\r\n        y_diff = self.y - other.y\r\n        return math.sqrt(x_diff ** 2 + y_diff ** 2)\r\n\r\n\r\ndef main() -> None:\r\n    origin = Point(0, 0)\r\n    pnt = Point(10, 15)\r\n    print(f\"Distance: {pnt.distance_to(origin)}\")\r\n\r\n\r\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\r\n    main()\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Current behavior\r\n\r\nPylint is perfectly happy:\r\n\r\n```\r\n(venv) [nturett@dev core]$ pylint test.py\r\n(venv) [nturett@dev core]$ \r\n```\r\n\r\nPython is not:\r\n\r\n```\r\n(venv) [nturett@dev core]$ python test.py\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n  File \"test.py\", line 4, in <module>\r\n    class Point:\r\n  File \"test.py\", line 9, in Point\r\n    def distance_to(self, other: Point) -> float:\r\nNameError: name 'Point' is not defined\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\n\r\nSince this code will apparently never run, I would expect that pylint would return an undefined-variable error, matching the interpreter's actions.\r\n\r\nInterestingly, if I change the line to include a misspelling, pylint catches it:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n    def distance_to(self, other: Piont) -> float:\r\n```\r\n\r\nyields:\r\n\r\n```\r\ntest.py:9:33: E0602: Undefined variable 'Piont' (undefined-variable)\r\n```\r\n\r\n### pylint --version output\r\n\r\n```\r\n(venv) [nturett@dev core]$ pylint --version\r\npylint 2.5.3\r\nastroid 2.4.2\r\nPython 3.7.8 (default, Jul 24 2020, 20:26:49) \r\n[GCC 7.3.1 20180712 (Red Hat 7.3.1-9)]\r\n```","closed_by":{"login":"DanielNoord","id":13665637,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNjY1NjM3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13665637?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/DanielNoord","html_url":"https://github.com/DanielNoord","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DanielNoord/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DanielNoord/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DanielNoord/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DanielNoord/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DanielNoord/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DanielNoord/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DanielNoord/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DanielNoord/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DanielNoord/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pylint-dev/pylint/issues/3771/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pylint-dev/pylint/issues/3771/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
