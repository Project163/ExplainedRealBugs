Question\n\nThe [Python team for VS Code](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-python) has been working on putting various tools we support behind [LSP](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/) and breaking them out into their own extensions This work is now far enough along that we wanted to share the extension prototypes for your tool with you and see if you had any interest in owning the extension or the Python-based LSP server backing it yourself?\r\n\r\nIf you don't want to take on that responsibility that's totally fine and understandable! If you want to leave the extension to us we would then publish the extension on the [VS Code Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/VSCode) ourselves. We also plan to publish the extension as open source and support the extension for as long as we felt it made sense to based on usage numbers. But due to the difficulty of migrating extension ownership, we wanted to ask early whether you wanted to own the extension from the start? If you did want to own the extension we would give you the code, help you publish to the VS Code Marketplace, and do anything else we can to help you be successful with this.\r\n\r\nWe have attached a zip file to this issue containing a prototype extension to give you an idea of what we are planning. You can download it, extract the `.vsix` file, and then [install the VSIX](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/extension-marketplace#_install-from-a-vsix) to try it out [python-pylint.zip](https://github.com/PyCQA/pylint/files/8051497/python-pylint.zip). This prototype version was built with python 3.10 and bundles pylint v2.12.2 (as fallback if nothing is found in your environment).\r\n\r\nTo be very clear, there's no pressure or expectations from us. We just want to make sure you as a project had an opportunity to own this extension instead of us from the get-go before the extension gained traction.\n\n### Documentation for future user\n\nNothing for now\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No

Current problem\n\nThe work on #5953 showed that specifically enabling just a single message is sometimes not working as expected.\r\nThis is due to either missing message declaration in a checkers ``msgs`` attribute or the incorrect usage of the ``@check_messages`` decorator.\r\nIdeally I would like to implement a new, optional checker aimed at Pylint core development and custom checker development.\r\nThis checker would focus on correct message declaration and handling. \r\nI already started working on it, but noticed that there is especially quite some problems with the ``@check_messages`` decorator. I totally understand that, because while being extensively used across all checker classes, there is not a single word on its purpose and effect in the documentation. Its docstring is also not really helpful, you have to dig deeper into the codebase to understand what it does.\n\n### Desired solution\n\nBefore continuing my work on the new checker, I want to address and clarify some questions about the intended use of ``@check_messages``. \r\nAfter that this issue can be closed with a PR that extends the documentation, and if necessary some code changes.\r\n\r\nA brief explanation on what ``@check_messages`` does:\r\nIt helps the ``ASTWalker`` decide whether a callback for the current node type should be called or not. \r\nThis is done by adding the list of messages passed in as a ``checks_messages`` attribute on method object.\r\nWhen a checker is added to the ``ASTWalker`` instance, it loops over all of its methods. Every method starting with ``visit_`` or ``leave_`` is now checked for the ``checks_messages`` attribute:\r\n* if the attribute does not exist, this method will be added to the list of callbacks\r\n* if it exists and at least one message of the ``checks_messages`` list is enabled, this method will be added to the list of callbacks\r\n* otherwise, it will not be added to the list of callbacks and will therefore **not** be executed\r\n\r\nEssentially this means:\r\n1. The main (and only) intent of the ``@check_messages`` decorator is to improve performance\r\n2. Placing the ``@check_messages`` decorator on any method which is not a \"top level callback\" (methods starting with ``visit_`` or ``leave_`` does not have any effect\r\n3. Forgetting to apply the ``@check_messages`` decorator has no negative functional consequences, it only affects performance (which, of course, is always an issue)\r\n4. Applying the decorator but forgetting to add messages that are emitted from this callback can lead to false negatives: if none of the messages actually included in the decorator are enabled, it will not be called\r\n5. Applying the decorator to a callback that not only emits messages but also does other things can have nasty side effects (false positives, false negatives, crashes)\r\n\r\n**What I want to gain a consensus on:**\r\n1. Do we want to keep the name ``check_messages``? I don't think it really conveys the effect it has on the decorated method.\r\n2. What shall we regard as best practice for this decorator? Should every callback be decorated and the list of messages must always be correct and consistent, or should we rather advise to use it only in cases where we expect a significant speedup when this callback is omitted?\r\n3. Do we want to keep the restriction that this decorator only has an effect on the \"top level callbacks\"? Seeing that a lot of those callbacks can emit quite a lot of messages and the logic for the checks is often split up into several subfunctions, it would be more flexible and also more robust (as it is easier to keep track of the messages that need to be included in the decorator) if one could apply it on the subfunctions rather than on the top level callback.\r\n\r\nLooking over the code base there are quite a lot of places where the decorator is not used correctly:\r\n* used with simply passing in all messages (which has the same effect as just omitting it): ``@check_messages(*MSGS)``\r\n* used on methods that are not a callback (which has no effect)\r\n* Used, but not including all messages possibly emitted by the callback\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pylint-dev/pylint/issues/6060/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pylint-dev/pylint/issues/6060/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
