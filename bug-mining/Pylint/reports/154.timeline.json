Must be passed if using the\r\n        authorization code grant. This must exactly match the redirect uri on\r\n        the client's settings page. Additionally, in order for ossapi to receive\r\n        authentication from this redirect uri, it must be a port on localhost.\r\n        So \"http://localhost:3914/\", \"http://localhost:727/\", etc are all valid\r\n        redirect uris. You can change your client's redirect uri from its\r\n        settings page.\r\n    scopes: List[str]\r\n        What scopes to request when authenticating.\r\n    grant: Grant or str\r\n        Which oauth grant (aka flow) to use when authenticating with the api.\r\n        Currently the api offers the client credentials (pass \"client\" for this\r\n        parameter) and authorization code (pass \"authorization\" for this\r\n        parameter) grants.\r\n        |br|\r\n        The authorization code grant requires user interaction to authenticate\r\n        the first time, but grants full access to the api. In contrast, the\r\n        client credentials grant does not require user interaction to\r\n        authenticate, but only grants guest user access to the api. This means\r\n        you will not be able to do things like download replays on the client\r\n        credentials grant.\r\n        |br|\r\n        If not passed, the grant will be automatically inferred as follows: if\r\n        ``redirect_uri`` is passed, use the authorization code grant. If\r\n        ``redirect_uri`` is not passed, use the client credentials grant.\r\n    strict: bool\r\n        Whether to run in \"strict\" mode. In strict mode, ossapi will raise an\r\n        exception if the api returns an attribute in a response which we didn't\r\n        expect to be there. This is useful for developers which want to catch\r\n        new attributes as they get added. More checks may be added in the future\r\n        for things which developers may want to be aware of, but normal users do\r\n        not want to have an exception raised for.\r\n        |br|\r\n        If you are not a developer, you are very unlikely to want to use this\r\n        parameter.\r\n    token_directory: str\r\n        If passed, the given directory will be used to store and retrieve token\r\n        files instead of locally wherever ossapi is installed.

Since python lacks a good\r\n        deserialization library, I've opted to use type annotations and type\r\n        annotations only to convert json to objects. A breakdown follows.\r\n\r\n        Every endpoint defines a base object, let's say it's a ``Score``. We\r\n        first instantiate this object with the json we received. This is easy to\r\n        do because (almost) all of our objects are dataclasses, which means we\r\n        can pass the json as ``Score(**json)`` and since the names of our fields\r\n        coincide with the names of the api json keys, everything works.\r\n\r\n        This populates all of the surface level members, but nested attributes\r\n        which are annotated as another dataclass object will still be dicts. So\r\n        we traverse down the tree of our base object's attributes (depth-first,\r\n        though I'm pretty sure BFS would work just as well), looking for any\r\n        attribute with a type annotation that we need to deal with. For\r\n        instance, ``Score`` has a ``beatmap`` attribute, which is annotated as\r\n        ``Optional[Beatmap]``. We ignore the optional annotation (since we're\r\n        looking at this attribute, we must have received data for it, so it's\r\n        nonnull) and then instantiate the ``beatmap`` attribute the same way\r\n        we instantiated the ``Score`` - with ``Beatmap(**json)``. Of course, the\r\n        variables will look different in the method (``type_(**value)``).\r\n\r\n        Finally, when traversing the attribute tree, we also look for attributes\r\n        which aren't dataclasses, but we still need to convert. For instance,\r\n        any attribute with an annotation of ``datetime`` or ``Mod`` we convert\r\n        to a ``datetime`` and ``Mod`` object respectively.\r\n\r\n        This code is arguably trying to be too smart for its own good, but I\r\n        think it's very elegant from the perspective of \"just add a dataclass\r\n        that mirrors the api's objects and everything works\". Will hopefully\r\n        make changing our dataclasses to account for breaking api changes in\r\n        the future trivial as well.\r\n\r\n        And if I'm being honest, it was an excuse to learn the internals of\r\n        python's typing system.\r\n        \"\"\"\r\n        # we want to get the annotations of inherited members as well, which is\r\n        # why we pass ``type(obj)`` instead of just ``obj``, which would only\r\n        # return annotations for attributes defined in ``obj`` and not its\r\n        # inherited attributes.\r\n        annotations = get_type_hints(type(obj))\r\n        override_annotations = obj.override_types()\r\n        annotations = {**annotations, **override_annotations}\r\n        self.log.debug(f\"resolving annotations for type {type(obj)}\")\r\n        for attr, value in obj.__dict__.items():\r\n            # we use this attribute later if we encounter an attribute which\r\n            # has been instantiated generically, but we don't need to do\r\n            # anything with it now.\r\n            if attr == \"__orig_class__\":\r\n                continue\r\n            type_ = annotations[attr]\r\n            # when we instantiate types, we explicitly fill in optional\r\n            # attributes with ``None``.
