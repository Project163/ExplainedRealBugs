Please describe\r\nSince python [3.7](https://docs.python.org/3.7/whatsnew/3.7.html) there is a new builtin [`breakpoint()`](https://docs.python.org/3.7/whatsnew/3.7.html#pep-553-built-in-breakpoint). Although there are environment variables you can set in production to make `breakpoint()` a no-op, the default behavior (unset) is to allow `breakpoint()`. Further, setting this flag makes it circuitous to use a breakpoint when you need one in a shell, or doing some debugging.\r\n\r\nHow often do you intentionally commit breakpoints into your packages? Projects? Production? Even in test environments its unusual.\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\nA new warning :)\r\n\r\n### Additional context\r\nFrom [PEP 553](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0553/#environment-variable) re: breakpoints:\r\n\r\n> Completely disabling all accidental breakpoint() calls pushed to production. This could be accomplished by setting PYTHONBREAKPOINT=0 in the execution environment. Another suggestion by reviewers of the PEP was to set PYTHONBREAKPOINT=sys.exit in this case.\r\n\r\n### Uncertain\r\n\r\nShould `sys.breakpointhook()` also be disallowed?","closed_by":{"login":"Pierre-Sassoulas","id":5493666,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0OTM2NjY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5493666?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pierre-Sassoulas","html_url":"https://github.com/Pierre-Sassoulas","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pierre-Sassoulas/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pierre-Sassoulas/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pierre-Sassoulas/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pierre-Sassoulas/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pierre-Sassoulas/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pierre-Sassoulas/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pierre-Sassoulas/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pierre-Sassoulas/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pierre-Sassoulas/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pylint-dev/pylint/issues/3692/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pylint-dev/pylint/issues/3692/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
