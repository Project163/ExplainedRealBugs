However, the check currently only seems to care about additional parameters if they are positional-or-keyword parameters. The check does not emit any violations for additional positional-only parameters, additional keyword-only parameters, additional variadic positional parameters, or additional variadic keyword parameters. This seems off to me: defining those additional parameters is just as strange/incorrect as defining additional positional-or-keyword parameters.\r\n\r\nTo illustrate, only the `a` property in the following example triggers an `R0206` violation, whereas I would expect `R0206` to be emitted on `a`, `b`, `c`, `d` and `e`:\r\n\r\n```py\r\nclass Foo:\r\n   @property\r\n   def a(self, arg):\r\n       return arg\r\n\r\n   @property\r\n   def b(self, arg, /):\r\n      return arg\r\n\r\n   @property\r\n   def c(self, *, arg):\r\n      return arg\r\n\r\n   @property\r\n   def d(self, *args):\r\n      return args\r\n\r\n   @property\r\n   def e(self, **kwargs):\r\n      return kwargs\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis means that `R0206` is not actually emitted on the motivating example originally given for this check in https://github.com/pylint-dev/pylint/issues/3006#issue-468017491, since that example has an additional variadic keyword parameter (`**kwargs`).\r\n\r\n\r\n### Command used\r\n\r\n```shell\r\npylint foo.py --disable=W0311,C0114,C0104,C0115,C0116,R0903\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Pylint output\r\n\r\n```\r\n************* Module foo\r\nfoo.py:3:3: R0206: Cannot have defined parameters for properties (property-with-parameters)\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Expected output\r\n\r\n```\r\n************* Module foo\r\nfoo.py:3:3: R0206: Cannot have defined parameters for properties (property-with-parameters)\r\nfoo.py:7:3: R0206: Cannot have defined parameters for properties (property-with-parameters)\r\nfoo.py:11:3: R0206: Cannot have defined parameters for properties (property-with-parameters)\r\nfoo.py:15:3: R0206: Cannot have defined parameters for properties (property-with-parameters)\r\nfoo.py:19:3: R0206: Cannot have defined parameters for properties (property-with-parameters)\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Pylint version\r\n\r\n```shell\r\npylint 3.1.0\r\nastroid 3.1.0\r\nPython 3.12.2 (main, Feb 15 2024, 19:30:27) [Clang 15.0.0 (clang-1500.1.0.2.5)]\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### OS / Environment\r\n\r\nMacOS\r\n\r\n### Additional dependencies\r\n\r\nNone","closed_by":{"login":"Pierre-Sassoulas","id":5493666,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0OTM2NjY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5493666?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pierre-Sassoulas","html_url":"https://github.com/Pierre-Sassoulas","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pierre-Sassoulas/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pierre-Sassoulas/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pierre-Sassoulas/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pierre-Sassoulas/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pierre-Sassoulas/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pierre-Sassoulas/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pierre-Sassoulas/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pierre-Sassoulas/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pierre-Sassoulas/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pylint-dev/pylint/issues/9584/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pylint-dev/pylint/issues/9584/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
