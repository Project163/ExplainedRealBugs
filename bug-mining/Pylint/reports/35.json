Steps to reproduce\r\nUse pylint on the following minimal code snippet:\r\n```python\r\nl = [1, 2, 3]\r\nlen(l) if l else 0\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Current behavior\r\n\r\nPylint issues the warning `len-as-condition` on the second line of the above code.\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\n\r\nSince `len` is not used as a condition in the above code I would not expect pylint to issue the
