Fixes #1681.\r\nIt only fixes the problem for directive *fixme*.\r\nThe problem here is that a message is added for commented lines beginning with ``#FIXME`` or ``#TODO`` or ``#XXX`` even if the ``#pylint disable=fixme`` is present.\r\nIn fact the astroid parser doesn't include the commented lines that are following the last module statement.\r\nThus the astroid module object can not inform pylint about the directives that are present in those extra lines.\r\nThe fix consists in manually anlysing those lines with different regexp and string manipulations.

disable=fixme`` directive.\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\n1.  Create a file named line_too_long.py\r\n2.  Paste into it the follwing code:\r\n```\r\n#pylint: disable=missing-docstring\r\n# This line is toooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo looooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooong\r\n\r\n# This line is toooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo looooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooong #pylint: disable=line-too-long\r\n\r\n# This line is toooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo looooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooong #pylint: disable=fixme\r\n\r\n#TODO: This line is toooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo looooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooong #pylint: disable=fixme\r\n\r\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\r\n    print('ok')\r\n```\r\n3. Launch pylint over line_too_long.py\r\n\r\n### Current behavior\r\n```\r\nNo config file found, using default configuration\r\n************* Module line_too_long\r\nC:  2, 0: Line too long (109/100)
