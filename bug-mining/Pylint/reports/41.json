### Steps to reproduce\r\nI can't actually reproduce this without my exact code, but the structure looks like:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom typing import Dict, NamedTuple, NewType, Set\r\n\r\nUserId = NewType('UserId', str)  # pylint: disable=invalid-name\r\nPlaceId = NewType('PlaceId', str)  # pylint: disable=invalid-name\r\n\r\n\r\nclass Bar(NamedTuple):\r\n    place: PlaceId\r\n    name: str\r\n\r\n\r\nclass Foo(NamedTuple):\r\n    user: Dict[UserId, Set[Bar]]\r\n```\r\n\r\nwithout the `disable=invalid-name` this succeeds fine, but with it I get:\r\n\r\n```\r\nTraceback (most recent
