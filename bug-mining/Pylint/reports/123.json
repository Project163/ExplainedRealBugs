Current problem\n\nThe project which actively uses Pylint can contain many disabling of Pylint checkers via the code comments:\r\nhttp://pylint.pycqa.org/en/latest/user_guide/message-control.html\r\n- this can significantly litter a code with tons of comments (Pylint, flake, mypy, etc., individually or all together)\r\n- this can hide actual code errors\r\n- slows down Pylint analysis\n\n### Desired solution\n\nIn my opinion, people disable checkers  via the code comments in the next common cases:\r\n- unsupported Pylint feature\r\n- broken Pylint feature (for example, regression after upgrade)\r\n\r\nI think it will be useful to have an option to check such disabling and report if disabling is no longer needed (only code comments).\r\n\r\nInspired by mypy's:\r\n> --warn-unused-ignores\r\nThis flag will make mypy report an error whenever your code uses a # type: ignore comment on a line that is not actually generating an error message.\r\n>\r\n> This flag, along with the --warn-redundant-casts flag, are both particularly useful when you are upgrading mypy. Previously, you may have needed to add casts or # type: ignore annotations to work around bugs in mypy or missing stubs for 3rd party libraries.\r\n>\r\n> These two flags let you discover cases where either workarounds are no longer necessary.\r\n\r\nhttps://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/command_line.html?highlight=unused-ignores#cmdoption-mypy-warn-unused-ignores\r\n\r\n\n\n### (Additional context)\n\n_No response_","closed_by":{"login":"Pierre-Sassoulas","id":5493666,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0OTM2NjY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5493666?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pierre-Sassoulas","html_url":"https://github.com/Pierre-Sassoulas","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pierre-Sassoulas/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pierre-Sassoulas/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pierre-Sassoulas/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pierre-Sassoulas/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pierre-Sassoulas/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pierre-Sassoulas/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pierre-Sassoulas/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pierre-Sassoulas/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pierre-Sassoulas/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pylint-dev/pylint/issues/4757/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pylint-dev/pylint/issues/4757/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
