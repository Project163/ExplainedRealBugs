you for submitting a PR to pylint!\r\n\r\nTo ease the process of reviewing your PR, do make sure to complete the following boxes.\r\n\r\n- [ ] Document your change, if it is a non-trivial one.\r\n  - A maintainer might label the issue ``skip-news`` if the change does not need to be in the changelog.\r\n  - Otherwise, create a news fragment with ``towncrier create <IssueNumber>.<type>`` which will be\r\n    included in the changelog. ``<type>`` can be one of the types defined in `./towncrier.toml`.\r\n    If necessary you can write details or offer examples on how the new change is supposed to work.\r\n  - Generating the doc is done with ``tox -e docs``\r\n- [ ] Relate your change to an issue in the tracker if such an issue exists (Refs #1234, Closes #1234)\r\n- [ ] Write comprehensive commit messages and/or a good description of what the PR does.\r\n- [ ] Keep the change small, separate the consensual changes from the opinionated one.\r\n  Don't hesitate to open multiple PRs if the change requires it. If your review is so\r\n  big it requires to actually plan and allocate time to review, it's more likely\r\n  that it's going to go stale.\r\n- [ ] If you used multiple emails or multiple names when

new in Pylint 3.1.0?\r\n---------------------------\r\nRelease date: 2024-02-25\r\n\r\n\r\nNew Features\r\n------------\r\n\r\n- Skip ``consider-using-join`` check for non-empty separators if an ``suggest-join-with-non-empty-separator`` option is set to ``no``.\r\n\r\n  Closes #8701 \r\n\r\n- Discover ``.pyi`` files when linting.\r\n\r\n  These can be ignored with the ``ignore-patterns`` setting.\r\n\r\n  Closes #9097 \r\n\r\n- Check ``TypeAlias`` and ``TypeVar`` (PEP 695) nodes for ``invalid-name``.\r\n\r\n  Refs #9196 \r\n\r\n- Support for resolving external toml files named pylintrc.toml and .pylintrc.toml.\r\n\r\n  Closes #9228 \r\n\r\n- Check for `.clear`, `.discard`, `.pop` and `remove` methods being called on a set while it is being iterated over.\r\n\r\n  Closes #9334 \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNew Checks\r\n----------\r\n\r\n- New message `use-yield-from` added to the refactoring checker. This message is emitted when yielding from a loop can be replaced by `yield from`.\r\n\r\n  Closes #9229. \r\n\r\n- Added a ``deprecated-attribute`` message to check deprecated attributes in the stdlib.\r\n\r\n  Closes #8855 \r\n\r\n\r\nFalse Positives Fixed\r\n---------------------\r\n\r\n- Fixed false positive for ``inherit-non-class`` for generic Protocols.\r\n\r\n  Closes #9106\r\n\r\n- Exempt ``TypedDict`` from ``typing_extensions`` from ``too-many-ancestor`` checks.\r\n\r\n  Refs #9167 \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFalse Negatives Fixed\r\n---------------------\r\n\r\n- Extend broad-exception-raised and broad-exception-caught to except*.\r\n\r\n  Closes #8827 \r\n\r\n- Fix a false-negative for unnecessary if blocks using a different than expected ordering of arguments.\r\n\r\n  Closes #8947. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOther Bug Fixes\r\n---------------\r\n\r\n- Improve the message provided for wrong-import-order check.  Instead of the import statement (\"import x\"), the message now specifies the import that is out of order and which imports should come after it.  As reported in the issue, this is particularly helpful if there are multiple imports on a single line that do not follow the PEP8 convention.\r\n\r\n  The message will report imports as follows:\r\n  For \"import X\", it will report \"(standard/third party/first party/local) import X\"\r\n  For \"import X.Y\" and \"from X import Y\", it will report \"(standard/third party/first party/local) import X.Y\"\r\n  The import category is specified to provide explanation as to why pylint has issued the message and guidence to the developer on how to fix the problem.\r\n\r\n  Closes #8808 \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOther Changes\r\n-------------\r\n\r\n- Print how many files were checked in verbose mode.\r\n\r\n  Closes #8935 \r\n\r\n- Fix a crash when an enum class which is also decorated with a ``dataclasses.dataclass`` decorator is defined.\r\n\r\n  Closes #9100 \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInternal Changes\r\n----------------\r\n\r\n- Update astroid version to 3.1.0.\r\n\r\n  Refs #9457 \r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pylint-dev/pylint/issues/9461/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pylint-dev/pylint/issues/9461/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":11991144606,"node_id":"REFE_lADOAtdnV85yqgHgzwAAAALKulie","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pylint-dev/pylint/issues/events/11991144606","actor":{"login":"netbsd-srcmastr","id":27641251,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3NjQxMjUx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/27641251?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/netbsd-srcmastr","html_url":"https://github.com/netbsd-srcmastr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/netbsd-srcmastr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/netbsd-srcmastr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/netbsd-srcmastr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/netbsd-srcmastr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/netbsd-srcmastr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/netbsd-srcmastr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/netbsd-srcmastr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/netbsd-srcmastr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/netbsd-srcmastr/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"e20c625f3a6abe7f39e63816483dad6c7bb0d200","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/NetBSD/pkgsrc/commits/e20c625f3a6abe7f39e63816483dad6c7bb0d200","created_at":"2024-03-03T20:58:39Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
