Inclusion of this file would immediately have these benefits:\r\n\r\n- Users will have the necessary metadata to properly cite pylint.\r\n- GitHub can automatically generate both APA and BibTeX formatted citations. A \"Cite this repository\" option will automatically appear on the repo's sidebar when viewed on a desktop browser.\r\n- Reference managers like Zotero will automatically detect the metadata so the user can save the citation to their library.\n\n### Additional context\n\nExamples of popular packages using this are [pandas](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas) and [tensorflow](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow).\r\n\r\nI would be happy to create an initial version of this and open a PR if there is interest in possibly merging it after refinement.","closed_by":{"login":"Pierre-Sassoulas","id":5493666,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0OTM2NjY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5493666?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pierre-Sassoulas","html_url":"https://github.com/Pierre-Sassoulas","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pierre-Sassoulas/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pierre-Sassoulas/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pierre-Sassoulas/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pierre-Sassoulas/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pierre-Sassoulas/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pierre-Sassoulas/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pierre-Sassoulas/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pierre-Sassoulas/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pierre-Sassoulas/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pylint-dev/pylint/issues/8760/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pylint-dev/pylint/issues/8760/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
