This is happening because pre-commit is only looking for tags from the default branch, and the last tag on on this branch is outdated.\r\n\r\nEven if user is manually changing the tag to use current `pylint-2.7.2` version, next time it runs autoupdate, it will downgrade the version. As users can easily have lots of pre-commit hook repositories configured, it would mean that they will always have to undo the downgrade.\r\n\r\nI did contact @asottile on discord about this issue, but it seems that he does not consider this to be a bug of pre-commit and more of a particular issue with pylint development workflow, where release tags are not created on main branch.\r\n\r\nI am not sure where the \"blame\" is, but I hope we can find a solution that does not cripple use of pre-commit auto-update. Any ideas?\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"Pierre-Sassoulas","id":5493666,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0OTM2NjY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5493666?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pierre-Sassoulas","html_url":"https://github.com/Pierre-Sassoulas","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pierre-Sassoulas/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pierre-Sassoulas/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pierre-Sassoulas/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pierre-Sassoulas/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pierre-Sassoulas/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pierre-Sassoulas/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pierre-Sassoulas/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pierre-Sassoulas/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pierre-Sassoulas/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pylint-dev/pylint/issues/4245/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pylint-dev/pylint/issues/4245/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
