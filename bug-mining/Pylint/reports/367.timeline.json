During the transfer of the two test issues I already noticed a mistake in the examples for `pylint-errors` (a bad code example that was actually good code), so just migrating all data doesn't really work. Besides, the work necessary to migrate their data structure to ours isn't really worth the effort (imo). For example, the data that is in their `Rationale` sections is a combination of the message that gets emitted by `pylint`, the message description that is in the `pylint` code and some of their own comments. Often the data that originally came from `pylint` will be outdated so we also can't automate the separation of these types of data into `details.rst`, `related.rst` and not useful.\r\n\r\nBasically, if we want to migrate the data we would need to put in so much effort that it is probably much better to do it by hand and just do one review for each message instead of doing multiple across many different steps.\r\n_Having no code example is better than copying incorrect code examples I think, so we would also need to check the data that gets migrated in any automated step..._\r\n\r\nThat's why I added the line about adding co-authorship: I do want to credit them for any inspiration we use in our documentation.","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pylint-dev/pylint/issues/comments/1076733775/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"DanielNoord","id":13665637,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNjY1NjM3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13665637?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/DanielNoord","html_url":"https://github.com/DanielNoord","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DanielNoord/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DanielNoord/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DanielNoord/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DanielNoord/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DanielNoord/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DanielNoord/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DanielNoord/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DanielNoord/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DanielNoord/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pylint-dev/pylint/issues/comments/1076845682","html_url":"https://github.com/pylint-dev/pylint/issues/5953#issuecomment-1076845682","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pylint-dev/pylint/issues/5953","id":1076845682,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAtdnV85AL1xy","user":{"login":"Pierre-Sassoulas","id":5493666,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0OTM2NjY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5493666?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pierre-Sassoulas","html_url":"https://github.com/Pierre-Sassoulas","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pierre-Sassoulas/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pierre-Sassoulas/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pierre-Sassoulas/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pierre-Sassoulas/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pierre-Sassoulas/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pierre-Sassoulas/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pierre-Sassoulas/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pierre-Sassoulas/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pierre-Sassoulas/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-03-23T21:38:34Z","updated_at":"2022-03-23T21:38:34Z","body":">  I already noticed a mistake in the examples for pylint-errors\r\n\r\nYes I noticed that, this is why I proposed to review chunk by chunk.

Adds new checker to detect the use of manual __magic__ methods.\r\n\r\nDesign decisions:\r\n- I'm only flagging magic methods not attributes since they usually have genuine use cases. e.g. `my_instance_name = x.__class__.__name__` or `my_pkg_version = pkg.__version__`.\r\n- `super().__init__(self, ...)`, `Foo.__init__(self, ...)`, `super().__new__(cls, ...)`, or `Foo.__new__(cls, ...)` are all pretty common use cases where people manually call the magic method (`.__init__(...)` shows up 65 times in functional and `.__new__(...)` shows up 13 times). Therefore I've excluded them from this check.\r\n- [`cls.__subclasses__()`](https://github.com/PyCQA/pylint/blob/2a33b6742ec5cc0bc718ef6cc691ed16684b8cab/tests/functional/r/regression_02/regression_4982.py#L9) and [`.__init_subclass__`](https://github.com/PyCQA/pylint/blob/2a33b6742ec5cc0bc718ef6cc691ed16684b8cab/tests/functional/i/init_subclass_classmethod.py#L6-L8) are cases where there is no alternative to the dunder method so I've also excluded these.\r\n\r\n- I've disabled this rule in a couple of the existing tests since they use `__setattr__`, `__get__`, or `__iter__`. Which should be replaced with `setattr(...)`, `.get(...)/[...]`, or `iter(...)` respectively. Happy to update those tests if we'd rather do that instead of ignoring?\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pylint-dev/pylint/issues/5938/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":1,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pylint-dev/pylint/issues/5938/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"actor":{"login":"matusvalo","id":827060,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgyNzA2MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/827060?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/matusvalo","html_url":"https://github.com/matusvalo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matusvalo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matusvalo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matusvalo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matusvalo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matusvalo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matusvalo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matusvalo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matusvalo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/matusvalo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-03-26T22:43:30Z","updated_at":"2022-03-26T22:43:30Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pylint-dev/pylint/issues/5991","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pylint-dev/pylint","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pylint-dev/pylint/issues/5991/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pylint-dev/pylint/issues/5991/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pylint-dev/pylint/issues/5991/events","html_url":"https://github.com/pylint-dev/pylint/pull/5991","id":1182142856,"node_id":"PR_kwDOAtdnV841FuVn","number":5991,"title":"Added
