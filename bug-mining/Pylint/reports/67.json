If pylint is incorporated as part of a build system, this can be problematic since it now results in what looks like an error.  \r\n\r\nThe merged commit mentions logging in \"non-quiet mode\", but I can't find a way to enter \"quiet mode\" from the command line...  (but please let me know if I'm missing something obvious).\r\n\r\nI don't understand the rationale behind using stderr rather than stdout to begin with; however if stderr must be used, please allow some way to actually enter \"quiet mode\".\r\n\r\n### Current behavior\r\nOne diagnostic line is output to stderr, no matter what.\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\nNothing is output to stderr (at least if \"quiet mode\" is enabled).\r\n\r\n### pylint --version output\r\npylint 1.8.2,\r\nastroid 1.6.1\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"PCManticore","id":448166,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0ODE2Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/448166?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/PCManticore","html_url":"https://github.com/PCManticore","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PCManticore/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PCManticore/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PCManticore/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PCManticore/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PCManticore/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PCManticore/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PCManticore/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PCManticore/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PCManticore/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pylint-dev/pylint/issues/1863/reactions","total_count":3,"+1":3,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pylint-dev/pylint/issues/1863/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
