Steps\r\n\r\n- [X] Add yourself to CONTRIBUTORS if you are a new contributor.\r\n- [ ] Add a ChangeLog entry describing what your PR does.\r\n- [ ] If it's a new feature or an important bug fix, add a What's New entry in\r\n      `doc/whatsnew/<current release.rst>`.\r\n- [X] Write a good description on what the PR does.\r\n\r\n## Description\r\n\r\nThis is a proposed fix for an issue where defining a function decorated with a list comprehension that shares argument name, and the argument is used twice in the list comprehension, it shows an undefined-variable error.\r\n\r\nTo put it in code:\r\n\r\n```python3\r\ndef decorator(seq):\r\n    return lambda f: f\r\n\r\n@decorator(x * x for x in \"123\")\r\ndef func(x):\r\n    pass\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis wrongfully shows an `undefined-variable` error since version at least 2.7.\r\n\r\n```python3\r\ndef decorator(seq):\r\n    return lambda f: f\r\n\r\n@decorator(x for x in \"123\")\r\ndef func(x):\r\n   pass\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is rightfully OK on the current `main`.\r\n\r\nThis probably will need changes, but I am not familiar enough with the codebase to go better about it.\r\n\r\n## Type of
