you for submitting a PR to pylint!\r\n\r\nTo ease the process of reviewing your PR, do make sure to complete the following boxes.\r\n\r\n- [ ] Document your change, if it is a non-trivial one.\r\n  - A maintainer might label the issue ``skip-news`` if the change does not need to be in the changelog.\r\n  - Otherwise, create a news fragment with ``towncrier create <IssueNumber>.<type>`` which will be\r\n    included in the changelog. ``<type>`` can be one of the types defined in `./towncrier.toml`.\r\n    If necessary you can write details or offer examples on how the new change is supposed to work.\r\n  - Generating the doc is done with ``tox -e docs``\r\n- [ ] Relate your change to an issue in the tracker if such an issue exists (Refs #1234, Closes #1234)\r\n- [ ] Write comprehensive commit messages and/or a good description of what the PR does.\r\n- [ ] Keep the change small, separate the consensual changes from the opinionated one.\r\n  Don't hesitate to open multiple PRs if the change requires it. If your review is so\r\n  big it requires to actually plan and allocate time to review, it's more likely\r\n  that it's going to go stale.\r\n- [ ] If you used multiple emails or multiple names when contributing, add your mails\r\n      and preferred name in ``script/.contributors_aliases.json``\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## Type of Changes\r\n\r\n<!-- Leave the corresponding lines for the applicable type of

new in Pylint 3.3.0?\r\n---------------------------\r\nRelease date: 2024-09-20\r\n\r\n\r\nChanges requiring user actions\r\n------------------------------\r\n\r\n- We migrated ``symilar`` to argparse, from getopt, so the error and help output changed\r\n  (for the better). We exit with 2 instead of sometime 1, sometime 2. The error output\r\n  is not captured by the runner anymore. It's not possible to use a value for the\r\n  boolean options anymore (``--ignore-comments 1`` should become ``--ignore-comments``).\r\n\r\n  Refs #9731\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNew Features\r\n------------\r\n\r\n- Add new `declare-non-slot` error which reports when a class has a `__slots__` member and a type hint on the class is not present in `__slots__`.\r\n\r\n  Refs #9499\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNew Checks\r\n----------\r\n\r\n- Added `too-many-positional-arguments` to allow distinguishing the configuration for too many\r\n  total arguments (with keyword-only params specified after `*`) from the configuration\r\n  for too many positional-or-keyword or positional-only arguments.\r\n\r\n  As part of evaluating whether this check makes sense for your project, ensure you\r\n  adjust the value of `--max-positional-arguments`.\r\n\r\n  Closes #9099\r\n\r\n- Add `using-exception-group-in-unsupported-version` and\r\n  `using-generic-type-syntax-in-unsupported-version` for uses of Python 3.11+ or\r\n  3.12+ features on lower supported versions provided with `--py-version`.\r\n\r\n  Closes #9791 \r\n\r\n- Add `using-assignment-expression-in-unsupported-version` for uses of `:=` (walrus operator)\r\n  on Python versions below 3.8 provided with `--py-version`.\r\n\r\n  Closes #9820 \r\n\r\n- Add `using-positional-only-args-in-unsupported-version` for uses of positional-only args on\r\n  Python versions below 3.8 provided with `--py-version`.\r\n\r\n  Closes #9823 \r\n\r\n- Add ``unnecessary-default-type-args`` to the ``typing`` extension to detect the use\r\n  of unnecessary default type args for ``typing.Generator`` and ``typing.AsyncGenerator``.\r\n\r\n  Refs #9938 \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFalse Negatives Fixed\r\n---------------------\r\n\r\n- Fix computation of never-returning function: `Never` is handled in addition to `NoReturn`, and priority is given to the explicit `--never-returning-functions` option.\r\n\r\n  Closes #7565.\r\n\r\n- Fix a false negative for `await-outside-async` when await is inside Lambda.\r\n\r\n  Refs #9653 \r\n\r\n- Fix a false negative for ``duplicate-argument-name`` by including ``positional-only``, ``*args`` and ``**kwargs`` arguments in the check.\r\n\r\n  Closes #9669 \r\n\r\n- Fix false negative for `multiple-statements` when multiple statements are present on `else` and `finally` lines of `try`.\r\n\r\n  Refs #9759 \r\n\r\n- Fix false negatives when `isinstance` does not have exactly two arguments.\r\n  pylint now emits a `too-many-function-args` or `no-value-for-parameter`\r\n  appropriately for `isinstance` calls.\r\n\r\n  Closes #9847 \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOther Bug Fixes\r\n---------------\r\n\r\n- `--enable` with `--disable=all` now produces an error, when an unknown msg code is used. Internal `pylint` messages are no longer affected by `--disable=all`.\r\n\r\n  Closes #9403 \r\n\r\n- Impossible to compile regexes for paths in the configuration or argument given to pylint won't crash anymore but\r\n  raise an argparse error and display the error message from ``re.compile`` instead.\r\n\r\n  Closes #9680 \r\n\r\n- Fix a bug where a ``tox.ini`` file with pylint configuration was ignored and it exists in the current directory.\r\n\r\n  ``.cfg`` and ``.ini`` files containing a ``Pylint`` configuration may now use a section named ``[pylint]``. This enhancement impacts the scenario where these file types are used as defaults when they are present and have not been explicitly referred to, using the ``--rcfile`` option.\r\n\r\n  Closes #9727\r\n\r\n- Improve file discovery for directories that are not python packages.\r\n\r\n  Closes #9764\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOther Changes\r\n-------------\r\n\r\n- Remove support for launching pylint with Python 3.8.\r\n  Code that supports Python 3.8 can still be linted with the ``--py-version=3.8`` setting.\r\n\r\n  Refs #9774 \r\n\r\n- Add support for Python 3.13.\r\n\r\n  Refs #9852\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInternal Changes\r\n----------------\r\n\r\n- All variables, classes, functions and file names containing the word 'similar', when it was,\r\n  in fact, referring to 'symilar' (the standalone program for the duplicate-code check) were renamed\r\n  to 'symilar'.\r\n\r\n  Closes #9734\r\n\r\n- Remove old-style classes (Python 2) code and remove check for new-style class since everything is new-style in Python 3. Updated doc for exception checker to remove reference to new style class.\r\n\r\n  Refs #9925 \r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pylint-dev/pylint/issues/9940/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pylint-dev/pylint/issues/9940/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
