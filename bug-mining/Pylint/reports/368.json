But [this Leo PR](https://github.com/leo-editor/leo-editor/pull/4068) demonstrates that IDE's can lint files (in the background!) when Leo writes a changed file.\r\n\r\n### IDE code to run pylint in the background when saving changed files\r\n\r\n```python\r\n# This is all Leo (IDE) code. There is no great need to understand it.\r\n\r\ndef run_pylint(self, fn: str, p: Position) -> None:\r\n    \"\"\"Run pylint on fn with the given pylint configuration file.\"\"\"\r\n    c, rc_fn = self.c, self.rc_fn\r\n\r\n    # Invoke pylint directly.\r\n    is_win = sys.platform.startswith('win')\r\n    args = ','.join([f\"'--rcfile={rc_fn}'\", f\"'{fn}'\"])\r\n    if is_win:\r\n        args = args.replace('\\\\', '\\\\\\\\')\r\n    command = (\r\n        f'{sys.executable} -c \"from pylint import lint; args=[{args}]; lint.Run(args)\"')\r\n    if not is_win:\r\n        command = shlex.split(command)  # type:ignore\r\n    \r\n    # Run the command using the BPM.\r\n    bpm = g.app.backgroundProcessManager\r\n    bpm.start_process(c, command, fn=fn, kind='pylint')\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Pylint output\r\n\r\nLeo outputs pylint messages in Leo's log pane.\r\nThe user can click on the links to go to the correct Leo (outline) node.\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\n\r\nRevise these words in the FAQ:\r\n\r\nI want to use pylint on each keystroke in my IDE, how can I do that ?\r\n\r\nDon't do it: pylint's full suite of checks is not fast enough for that and never will be. pylint is best suited for linting on save for small projects, or for a continuous integration job or a git pre-push hook for big projects. The larger your repository is, the slower pylint will be.\r\n\r\nIf you want to make pylint faster for this type of use case, you can use the --errors-only option, which will remove all the refactor, convention, and warning checks. You can also disable checks with inherently high complexity that need to analyse the full code base like duplicate-code or cyclic-import (this list is not exhaustive).\r\n\r\n### Pylint version, platform, etc.\r\n\r\nNot applicable.","closed_by":{"login":"Pierre-Sassoulas","id":5493666,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0OTM2NjY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5493666?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pierre-Sassoulas","html_url":"https://github.com/Pierre-Sassoulas","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pierre-Sassoulas/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pierre-Sassoulas/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pierre-Sassoulas/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pierre-Sassoulas/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pierre-Sassoulas/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pierre-Sassoulas/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pierre-Sassoulas/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pierre-Sassoulas/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pierre-Sassoulas/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pylint-dev/pylint/issues/9959/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pylint-dev/pylint/issues/9959/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
