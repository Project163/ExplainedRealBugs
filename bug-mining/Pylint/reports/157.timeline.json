The referenced issue was broken because whenever the `no_docstring_rgx` option was empty it would try to match `re.compile(\"\")` which always matched and would thus never check a parameter.\r\n\r\nThe change to `get_global_option()` is necessary for it to actually return a `Pattern[str]` for those options. A problem I couldn't solve was that it is impossible (I think) to tell `mypy` that the option belongs to `GLOBAL_OPTION_PATTERN` and should therefore return a `Pattern[str]`. This is because you can't use `isinstance` on `Literal` and there is no good solution to do this any other way (using `cast` also doesn't work).\r\n\r\n/CC @cdce8p Because you helped with #4978 and might have a solution for the `mypy` issue that I don't know about 😄 \r\n\r\nCloses

users such as the one who initially reported this bug will never figure out that they need to add `no_docstring_rgx=` to their `pylintrc` for it to check all functions. I think changing it to be empty is more in line with what users will expect the default value of a regex pattern to be.\r\n\r\nI would like confirmation on changing this default value before adding a commit that fixes the tests that fail because of the change.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, it seems like the unittests are really prone to incorrectly testing settings. The change to `\"no_docstring_rgx\": re.compile(\"\")`, in `tests/extensions/test_check_docs.py` shows that we might set settings to certain values with incorrect types and therefore passing/failing tests incorrectly. This is not something we can fix immediately but is something to keep in mind!\r\n\r\nCloses
