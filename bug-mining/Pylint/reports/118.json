Thank you for wanting to make pylint better.\r\n\r\n  Before you submit this, make sure that this feature wasn't\r\n  already requested or if it is not already implemented in the master branch.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe\r\nSometimes I need to inherit from classes defined in third-party libs. Sometimes these classes have long inheritance chain. I can't do anything about this, but still get too-many-ancestors.\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\nI want there was an option to count ancestors only in \"local\" code, so pylint will complain only about the part of problem I can fix.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Additional context\r\nHere's example where it would be useful: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/22834392/understanding-too-many-ancestors-from-pylint/43090406","closed_by":{"login":"Pierre-Sassoulas","id":5493666,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0OTM2NjY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5493666?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pierre-Sassoulas","html_url":"https://github.com/Pierre-Sassoulas","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pierre-Sassoulas/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pierre-Sassoulas/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pierre-Sassoulas/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pierre-Sassoulas/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pierre-Sassoulas/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pierre-Sassoulas/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pierre-Sassoulas/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pierre-Sassoulas/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pierre-Sassoulas/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pylint-dev/pylint/issues/3057/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pylint-dev/pylint/issues/3057/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
