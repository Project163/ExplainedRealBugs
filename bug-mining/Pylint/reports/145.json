Bug description\r\n\r\nWhen `use-symbolic-message-instead` is enabled, Pylint will correctly warn about the usage of non-symbolic ID in pragmas, like here.\r\n\r\n```python\r\n# pylint: disable=W0223\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis will output `I0023: 'W0223' is cryptic: use '# pylint: disable=abstract-method' instead (use-symbolic-message-instead)`.\r\n\r\nBut if the category letter of the ID is written *in lower case*, like here:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n# pylint: disable=w0223\r\n```\r\nPylint will **not** output the warning about not using a symbolic message.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Configuration\r\n\r\n```ini\r\n[MASTER]\r\nenable=use-symbolic-message-instead\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Command used\r\n\r\n```shell\r\npylint test.py\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Pylint output\r\n\r\nNo output.\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\n\r\nSince Pylint does allow lower case in the pragmas that use a numeric ID (e.g. `w0223`), having `use-symbolic-message-instead` enabled should also output a message regardless of the case of the ID used in the `disable` pragma.\r\n\r\n### Pylint version\r\n\r\n```shell\r\npylint 2.10.2\r\nastroid 2.7.3\r\nPython 3.8.10 (default, May  4 2021, 00:00:00)
