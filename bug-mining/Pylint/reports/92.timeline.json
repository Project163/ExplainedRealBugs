Description\r\n\r\nisort 5 has been released a few days ago (2020-07-04) but its API is not compatible anymore with pylint. We could switch to isort 5 (and require `isort>=5,<6`) as I did in #3724, but isort 5 dropped the compatibility with Python 3.5, which pylint still supports. So a better option could be this pull request that supports both isort 4 and isort 5 via a small wrapper.\r\n\r\nAll tests run with isort 5, except the Python 3.5 build that installs isort 4 (see https://github.com/PyCQA/pylint/pull/3725/commits/bc0a82a2104f063bf2b9d74406de4b7be0880938#diff-b91f3d5bd63fcd17221b267e851608e8R61-R62). One of the test is manually skipped there, as it seems complex to have a different expected output depending on the installed version of isort (see https://github.com/PyCQA/pylint/pull/3725/commits/bc0a82a2104f063bf2b9d74406de4b7be0880938#diff-37021361f4a7fe2764d8ff4537f22facR81-R84).\r\n\r\nI switched the style of pylint's own import statements and its tests to isort 5 in a separate commit.\r\n\r\n(Since pylint currently pins the version of isort to \">=4.2.5,<5\", I don't think there is anything urgent, despite the comments in

runtime error in a vendored dependency (toml).</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>5.0.0 Penny - July 4, 2020</h3>\n<p><strong>Breaking changes:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>isort now requires Python 3.6+ to run but continues to support formatting on ALL versions of python including\nPython 2 code.</li>\n<li>isort deprecates official support for Python 3.4, removing modules only in this release from known_standard_library:\n<ul>\n<li>user</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Config files are no longer composed on-top of each-other. Instead the first config file found is used.\n<ul>\n<li>Since there is no longer composition negative form settings (such as --dont-skip or it's config file variant <code>not_skip</code>) are no longer required and have been removed.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Two-letter shortened setting names (like <code>ac</code> for <code>atomic</code>) now require two dashes to avoid ambiguity: <code>--ac</code>.</li>\n<li>For consistency with other tools <code>-v</code> now is shorthand for verbose and <code>-V</code> is shorthand for version. See Issue: <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/timothycrosley/isort/issues/1067\">#1067</a>.</li>\n<li><code>length_sort_{section_name}</code> config usage has been deprecated. Instead <code>length_sort_sections</code> list can be used to specify a list of sections that need to be length sorted.</li>\n<li><code>safety_excludes</code> and <code>unsafe</code> have been deprecated</li>\n<li>Config now includes as default full set of safety directories defined by safety excludes.</li>\n<li><code>--recursive</code> option has been removed. Directories passed in are now automatically sorted recursive.</li>\n<li><code>--apply</code> option has been removed as it is the default behaviour.</li>\n<li>isort now does nothing, beyond giving instructions and exiting status code 0, when ran with no arguments.\n<ul>\n<li>a new <code>--interactive</code> flag has been added to enable the old style behaviour.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>isort now works on contiguous sections of imports, instead of one whole file at a time.</li>\n<li>isort now formats all nested &quot;as&quot; imports in the &quot;from&quot; form. <code>import x.y as a</code> becomes <code>from x import y as a</code>.</li>\n<li><code>keep_direct_and_as_imports</code> option now defaults to <code>True</code>.</li>\n<li><code>appdirs</code> is no longer supported.

Question\r\n\r\nI've done some issue cleanup this morning and saw we released 2.6.0 due to popular demand (#3722 with 70 thumbsups in less than a month) before we released 2.5.4. Should we have released as a minor version (ie. in 2.5.4 not 2.6.0) and pushed the milestone name to 2.5.5 ? What could we do to fix that now ? Maybe we change the name of the milestone ? Move everything to a 2.6.2 milestone ? Some issues are popular, like the concurrent job problem we fixed in #3738 so this is probably going to be a recurring problem that we have no \"guideline\" how to fix, especially since @PCManticore is a lot less involved right now.  \r\n\r\n@hippo91 @AWhetter ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pylint-dev/pylint/issues/3831/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pylint-dev/pylint/issues/3831/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":3811922122,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDM4MTE5MjIxMjI=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pylint-dev/pylint/issues/events/3811922122","actor":{"login":"jloehel","id":2422012,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0MjIwMTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2422012?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jloehel","html_url":"https://github.com/jloehel","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jloehel/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jloehel/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jloehel/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jloehel/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jloehel/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jloehel/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jloehel/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jloehel/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jloehel/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"f4cd95ce639b9cd330cefb1b83f201a6325053c8","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jloehel/python-logstash-async/commits/f4cd95ce639b9cd330cefb1b83f201a6325053c8","created_at":"2020-09-27T19:10:33Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
