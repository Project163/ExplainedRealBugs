Based on [Python's source code](https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/b9831e5c98de280870b6d932033b868ef56fa2fa/Lib/abc.py#L7-L25), [this parameter](https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/b9831e5c98de280870b6d932033b868ef56fa2fa/Lib/abc.py#L24) is the only implementation detail from the [`abstractmethod` decorator](https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/b9831e5c98de280870b6d932033b868ef56fa2fa/Lib/abc.py#L7-L25).\r\n\r\nSimplify put, if a function is found to have the attribute `__isabstractmethod__` set to `True`, then the pylint check [https://github.com/microsoft/pyright/blob/d58286a459e5a8afdd954e3e6033faa48cab5c0f/docs/configuration.md#reportGeneralTypeIssues](reportGeneralTypeIssues) should be satisfied.\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pylint-dev/pylint/issues/9018/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pylint-dev/pylint/issues/9018/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}
