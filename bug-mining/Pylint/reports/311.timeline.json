you for submitting a PR to pylint!\r\n\r\nTo ease the process of reviewing your PR, do make sure to complete the following boxes.\r\n\r\n- [ ] Document your change, if it is a non-trivial one.\r\n  - A maintainer might label the issue ``skip-news`` if the change does not need to be in the changelog.\r\n  - Otherwise, create a news fragment with ``towncrier create <IssueNumber>.<type>`` which will be\r\n    included in the changelog. ``<type>`` can be one of the types defined in `./towncrier.toml`.\r\n    If necessary you can write details or offer examples on how the new change is supposed to work.\r\n  - Generating the doc is done with ``tox -e docs``\r\n- [ ] Relate your change to an issue in the tracker if such an issue exists (Refs #1234, Closes #1234)\r\n- [ ] Write comprehensive commit messages and/or a good description of what the PR does.\r\n- [ ] Keep the change small, separate the consensual changes from the opinionated one.\r\n  Don't hesitate to open multiple PRs if the change requires it. If your review is so\r\n  big it requires to actually plan and allocate time to review, it's more likely\r\n  that it's going to go stale.\r\n- [ ] If you used multiple emails or multiple names when

changing my mind now; I see there's no issue in CPython. Mark's comments on #8556 were helpful, as was https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/87106.\r\n\r\nI want to suggest instead warning on the problematic call, not on the function definition itself. ~We should probably just craft a pylint warning for the TypeError mentioned at the top of https://github.com/pylint-dev/pylint/issues/8558#issue-1659977008.

you for submitting a PR to pylint!\r\n\r\nTo ease the process of reviewing your PR, do make sure to complete the following boxes.\r\n\r\n- [ ] Document your change, if it is a non-trivial one.\r\n  - A maintainer might label the issue ``skip-news`` if the change does not need to be in the changelog.\r\n  - Otherwise, create a news fragment with ``towncrier create <IssueNumber>.<type>`` which will be\r\n    included in the changelog. ``<type>`` can be one of the types defined in `./towncrier.toml`.\r\n    If necessary you can write details or offer examples on how the new change is supposed to work.\r\n  - Generating the doc is done with ``tox -e docs``\r\n- [ ] Relate your change to an issue in the tracker if such an issue exists (Refs #1234, Closes #1234)\r\n- [ ] Write comprehensive commit messages and/or a good description of what the PR does.\r\n- [ ] Keep the change small, separate the consensual changes from the opinionated one.\r\n  Don't hesitate to open multiple PRs if the change requires it. If your review is so\r\n  big it requires to actually plan and allocate time to review, it's more likely\r\n  that it's going to go stale.\r\n- [ ] If you used multiple emails or multiple names when contributing, add your mails\r\n      and preferred name in ``script/.contributors_aliases.json``\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## Type of Changes\r\n\r\n<!-- Leave the corresponding lines for the applicable type of change: -->\r\n\r\n|     | Type                   |\r\n| --- | ---------------------- |\r\n| ✓   | :bug: Bug fix          |\r\n| ✓   | :sparkles: New feature |\r\n|    | :hammer: Refactoring   |\r\n|  ✓  | :scroll: Docs          |\r\n\r\n## Description\r\n\r\n<!-- If this PR references an issue without fixing it: -->\r\nAdd a new checker ``kwarg-superseded-by-positional-arg`` to warn when a function is called with a keyword argument which shares a name with a positional-only parameter and the function contains a keyword variadic parameter dictionary. It may be surprising behaviour when the keyword argument is added to the keyword variadic parameter dictionary.\r\n\r\nThis prevents a false positive, in the above scenario, for ``redundant-keyword-arg``.\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- If this PR fixes an issue, use the following to automatically close when we merge: -->\r\n\r\nCloses
