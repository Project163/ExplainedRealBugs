Thank you for discovering and submitting an issue.\r\n\r\n  Before you submit this, make sure that the issue doesn't already exist\r\n  or if it is not closed.\r\n\r\n  Is your issue fixed on the preview release?: pip install pylint astroid --pre -U\r\n\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\nUsing `load-plugins=pylint.extensions.docparams`\r\n1. Create a function which potentially raises multiple Exceptions:\r\n```python\r\ndef function_name(args):\r\n    if isinstance(args, dict):\r\n        raise TypeError\r\n    elif isinstance(args, str):\r\n        raise ValueError\r\n    else:\r\n        raise ValidationError\r\n```\r\n2. Document such functionality as `:raises TypeError, ValueError, ValidationError`\r\n```python\r\n    \"\"\" A function that raises exceptions\r\n\r\n    :param args: The arguments\r\n    :type args: int\r\n\r\n    :raises TypeError, ValueError, ValidationError:\r\n    \"\"\"\r\n```\r\n3. Get [W9006(missing-raises-doc), function_name] \"ValueError\" not documented as being raised, et al.\r\n\r\nFull test file:\r\n```python\r\n#!/usr/bin/env python3\r\n\r\nclass ValidationError(Exception):\r\n    pass\r\n\r\ndef function_name(args):\r\n    \"\"\" A function that raises exceptions\r\n\r\n    :param args: The arguments\r\n    :type args: int\r\n\r\n    :raises TypeError, ValueError, ValidationError:\r\n    \"\"\"\r\n    if isinstance(args, dict):\r\n        raise TypeError\r\n    elif isinstance(args, str):\r\n        raise ValueError\r\n    else:\r\n        raise ValidationError\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Current behavior\r\n```\r\n************* Module test_raises\r\ntest_raises.py:6: [W9006(missing-raises-doc), function_name] \"TypeError\" not documented as being raised\r\ntest_raises.py:6: [W9006(missing-raises-doc), function_name] \"ValueError\" not documented as being raised\r\ntest_raises.py:6: [W9006(missing-raises-doc), function_name] \"ValidationError\" not documented as being raised\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\n\r\npylint passes / Your code has been rated at 10.00/10\r\n\r\n### pylint --version output\r\n```shell\r\n$ pylint --version\r\npylint 2.2.2\r\nastroid 2.1.0\r\nPython 3.7.2 (default, Jan 10 2019, 23:51:51)\r\n[GCC 8.2.1 20181127]\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Notes\r\n\r\nSphinx properly parses the Exception types raised and links them individually, so I believe only a small change would be needed in the regex [here](https://github.com/PyCQA/pylint/blob/pylint-2.2.2/pylint/extensions/_check_docs_utils.py#L291) and parsing of such [here](https://github.com/PyCQA/pylint/blob/pylint-2.2.2/pylint/extensions/_check_docs_utils.py#L322) to allow for comma+whitespace `(, *)` separated types.","closed_by":{"login":"PCManticore","id":448166,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0ODE2Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/448166?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/PCManticore","html_url":"https://github.com/PCManticore","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PCManticore/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PCManticore/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PCManticore/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PCManticore/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PCManticore/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PCManticore/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PCManticore/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PCManticore/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PCManticore/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pylint-dev/pylint/issues/2729/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pylint-dev/pylint/issues/2729/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
