Run a fresh installation of ubuntu with pylint to rule out any user-specific configuration:\r\n```bash\r\ndocker run -ti ubuntu:16.04 /bin/bash\r\napt-get update\r\napt install python3-pip\r\npip3 install pylint\r\n```\r\n2. Create a file `test.py` that contains a TODO comment with a `pylint: disable=fixme` directive after the last statement in the file, such as this one:\r\n```python\r\n# TODO: todo1 # pylint: disable=fixme\r\n# TODO: todo2 # pylint: disable=fixme\r\n\r\n\r\ndef foo():\r\n    return 1\r\n\r\n# TODO: todo3 # pylint: disable=fixme\r\n# TODO: todo4 # pylint: disable=fixme\r\n```\r\n3. Run pylint against it: `pylint test.py`\r\n\r\n### Current behavior\r\nFixme comments on line 8 and 9 are not ignored.\r\n```\r\nroot@c12a41fffb0e:/# pylint test2.py\r\nNo config file found, using default configuration\r\n************* Module test2\r\nW:  8, 0: TODO: todo3 # pylint: disable=fixme (fixme)\r\nW:  9, 0: TODO: todo4 # pylint: disable=fixme (fixme)\r\nC:  1, 0: Missing module docstring (missing-docstring)\r\nC:  5, 0: Black listed name \"foo\" (blacklisted-name)\r\nC:  5, 0: Missing function docstring (missing-docstring)\r\n\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nYour code has been rated at -15.00/10 (previous run: -15.00/10, +0.00)\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\nNo fixme warnings for lines 8 and 9 - essentially the same output as if `pylint --disable=fixme test2.py` was used.\r\n\r\n### pylint --version output\r\n```\r\nNo config file found, using default configuration\r\npylint 1.7.2,\r\nastroid 1.5.3\r\nPython 3.5.2 (default, Aug 18 2017, 17:48:00)\r\n[GCC 5.4.0 20160609]\r\n```\r\n\r\nUsing `#pragma pylint: disable=fixme` at the top of the file doesn't solve the issue. Using `--enable=useless-suppression` actually causes this to be added to the output:\r\n```\r\nI:  8, 0: Useless suppression of 'fixme' (useless-suppression)\r\nI:  9, 0: Useless suppression of 'fixme' (useless-suppression)\r\n```","closed_by":{"login":"PCManticore","id":448166,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0ODE2Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/448166?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/PCManticore","html_url":"https://github.com/PCManticore","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PCManticore/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PCManticore/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PCManticore/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PCManticore/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PCManticore/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PCManticore/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PCManticore/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PCManticore/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PCManticore/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pylint-dev/pylint/issues/1681/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pylint-dev/pylint/issues/1681/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
