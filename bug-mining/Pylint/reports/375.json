Here's the revelant excerpt from the [documentation](https://pylint.pycqa.org/en/latest/development_guide/how_tos/custom_checkers.html#defining-a-message):\n\n> The message-id should be a 4-digit number, prefixed with a message category. There are multiple message categories, these being C, W, E, F, R, standing for Convention, Warning, Error, Fatal and Refactoring. The 4 digits should not conflict with existing checkers and the first 2 digits should consistent across the checker (except shared messages).\n\nThere are a few issues with this:\n\n1. It's unclear what this means: \"and the first 2 digits should consistent across the checker (except shared messages)\".\n2. It's impossible to know beforehand which 4 digit codes pylint will choose to consume. If I make a custom pylint checker with code C5001 but then upgrade pylint to a version that also uses C5001, there'll be a conflict.\n3. It may be that 4-digits is not enough. Me and my team use XPath-like expressions to quickly build out a custom pylint checker whenever we run into a problematic pattern. Given that these XPath-like expressions lower the burden for creating custom checkers (compared to manually writing visitors), it's not that farfetched to reach 100+ custom checkers.\n\n### Desired solution\n\n1. Documentation might need light clarifications.\n2. Expand beyond 4-digit codes.\n3. Expand beyond just C,W,E,F,R (e.g. we might want to use D for documentation), or maybe just designate a character for custom checkers (e.g. X).\n\n### Additional context\n\nThank you for all your hard work on pylint / astroid.","closed_by":{"login":"Pierre-Sassoulas","id":5493666,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0OTM2NjY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5493666?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pierre-Sassoulas","html_url":"https://github.com/Pierre-Sassoulas","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pierre-Sassoulas/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pierre-Sassoulas/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pierre-Sassoulas/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pierre-Sassoulas/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pierre-Sassoulas/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pierre-Sassoulas/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pierre-Sassoulas/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pierre-Sassoulas/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pierre-Sassoulas/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pylint-dev/pylint/issues/10341/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pylint-dev/pylint/issues/10341/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
