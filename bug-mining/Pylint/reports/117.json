Although it only takes a little effort to remove this document after the test suite is done, it would be good if it was automatically removed afterwards.\r\n\r\nSomething as simple as checking for `getattr(runner, \"__name__\") == \"run_pyreverse\")` on line 19 and then `os.remove(classes.dot)` would do the trick, although I am not sure if such a solution fits the code style/policy of the project.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Configuration\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Command used\r\n\r\n```shell\r\ntox -e py39  -- -k pylint_runners\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Pylint output\r\n\r\n```shell\r\nCreates `classes.dot` in main directory.\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\n\r\nRemoving `classes.dot` after testing has been completed.\r\n\r\n### Pylint version\r\n\r\n```shell\r\npylint 2.9.5\r\nastroid 2.6.5\r\nPython 3.9.6 (default, Jun 29 2021, 05:25:02) \r\n[Clang 12.0.5 (clang-1205.0.22.9)]\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### OS / Environment\r\n\r\nmacOS Big Sur\r\n\r\n### Additional dependencies\r\n\r\n_No response_","closed_by":{"login":"Pierre-Sassoulas","id":5493666,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0OTM2NjY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5493666?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pierre-Sassoulas","html_url":"https://github.com/Pierre-Sassoulas","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pierre-Sassoulas/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pierre-Sassoulas/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pierre-Sassoulas/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pierre-Sassoulas/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pierre-Sassoulas/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pierre-Sassoulas/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pierre-Sassoulas/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pierre-Sassoulas/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pierre-Sassoulas/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pylint-dev/pylint/issues/4762/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pylint-dev/pylint/issues/4762/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
