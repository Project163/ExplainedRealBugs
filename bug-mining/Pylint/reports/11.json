we do drop support because 3.6 has reached its end of life, we'll need to do some cleanup:\r\n\r\n- [x] remove the code for Python 3.6 only and `PY36_PLUS` conditionals\r\n- [x] clean up the minimum required version in the tests and functional tests RC files (this has not been done previously) \r\n- [x] Use postponed evaluation of annotations (with from ``__future__`` import annotations) -> #6326\r\n- [x] Use dataclasses to simplify the code where it makes the most sense\r\n- [x] Bump `py-version` in `pylintrc` -> #6326\r\n- [x] Look at coverage drop in
