Those usecases are supported by mypy with a `TYPE_CHECKING` guard: https://github.com/python/mypy/issues/6726#issuecomment-486907505.\r\n\r\n```python\r\n# pylint: disable=missing-docstring,invalid-name\r\nfrom typing import TYPE_CHECKING\r\n\r\nif TYPE_CHECKING:\r\n    returns_staticmethod = staticmethod\r\nelse:\r\n    def returns_staticmethod(f): ...\r\n\r\n\r\nclass MyClass:\r\n    @returns_staticmethod\r\n    def my_staticmethod(a, b): # <======== pylint (E0213): Method should have \"self\" as first argument\r\n        return a + b\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, testing with pylint, an error pops up indicating `self` is not the first argument of the method above. Additionally, even if we are not using the `TYPE_CHECKING` guard, pylint does not seem to  propagate `staticmethod` decorator:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n# pylint: disable=missing-docstring,invalid-name,too-few-public-methods\r\nmy_decorator = staticmethod\r\n\r\nclass MyClass:\r\n    @my_decorator\r\n    def my_decorated_func(a, b): # <======== pylint (E0213): Method should have \"self\" as first argument\r\n        return a + b\r\n```\r\n\r\nIdeally, if pylint propagates `staticmethod` through `my_decorator`, the false positive would go away.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance!\r\n\r\n### Configuration\r\n\r\nConfiguration is not relevant\r\n\r\n### Command used\r\n\r\n```shell\r\npylint main.py\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Pylint output\r\n\r\n```shell\r\n************* Module main\r\nmain.py:14:4: E0213: Method should have \"self\" as first argument (no-self-argument)\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\n\r\nExpected that pylint propagates `staticmethod` via `my_decorator` so that the snippets below will work without warning:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n# pylint: disable=missing-docstring,invalid-name,too-few-public-methods\r\nmy_decorator = staticmethod\r\n\r\nclass MyClass:\r\n    @my_decorator\r\n    def my_decorated_func(a, b): # <======== pylint (E0213): Method should have \"self\" as first argument\r\n        return a + b\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Pylint version\r\n\r\n```shell\r\n>>> pylint --version\r\npylint 2.12.2\r\nastroid 2.9.0\r\nPython 3.8.13 (default, Mar 28 2022, 11:38:47)\r\n[GCC 7.5.0]\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### OS / Environment\r\n\r\nUbuntu 20.04\r\n\r\n### Additional dependencies\r\n\r\nN/A","closed_by":{"login":"jacobtylerwalls","id":38668450,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4NjY4NDUw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/38668450?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jacobtylerwalls","html_url":"https://github.com/jacobtylerwalls","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jacobtylerwalls/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jacobtylerwalls/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jacobtylerwalls/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jacobtylerwalls/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jacobtylerwalls/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jacobtylerwalls/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jacobtylerwalls/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jacobtylerwalls/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jacobtylerwalls/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pylint-dev/pylint/issues/7300/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pylint-dev/pylint/issues/7300/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
