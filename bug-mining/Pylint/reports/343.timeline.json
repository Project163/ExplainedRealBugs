you for submitting a PR to pylint!\r\n\r\nTo ease the process of reviewing your PR, do make sure to complete the following boxes.\r\n\r\n- [x] Document your change, if it is a non-trivial one.\r\n  - A maintainer might label the issue ``skip-news`` if the change does not need to be in the changelog.\r\n  - Otherwise, create a news fragment with ``towncrier create <IssueNumber>.<type>`` which will be\r\n    included in the changelog. ``<type>`` can be one of the types defined in `./towncrier.toml`.\r\n    If necessary you can write details or offer examples on how the new change is supposed to work.\r\n  - Generating the doc is done with ``tox -e docs``\r\n- [x] Relate your change to an issue in the tracker if such an issue exists (Refs #1234, Closes #1234)\r\n- [x] Write comprehensive commit messages and/or a good description of what the PR does.\r\n- [x] Keep the change small, separate the consensual changes from the opinionated one.\r\n  Don't hesitate to open multiple PRs if the change requires it. If your review is so\r\n  big it requires to actually plan and allocate time to review, it's more likely\r\n  that it's going to go stale.\r\n- [x] If you used multiple emails or multiple names when contributing, add your mails\r\n      and preferred name in ``script/.contributors_aliases.json``\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## Type of Changes\r\n\r\n<!-- Leave the corresponding lines for the applicable type of

new in Pylint 3.2.0?\r\n---------------------------\r\nRelease date: 2024-05-14\r\n\r\n\r\nNew Features\r\n------------\r\n\r\n- Understand `six.PY2` and `six.PY3` for conditional imports.\r\n\r\n  Closes #3501\r\n\r\n- A new `github` reporter has been added. This reporter  returns the output of `pylint` in a format that\r\n  Github can use to automatically annotate code. Use it with `pylint --output-format=github` on your Github Workflows.\r\n\r\n  Closes #9443. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNew Checks\r\n----------\r\n\r\n- Add check ``possibly-used-before-assignment`` when relying on names after an ``if/else``\r\n  switch when one branch failed to define the name, raise, or return.\r\n\r\n  Closes #1727 \r\n\r\n- Checks for generators that use contextmanagers that don't handle cleanup properly.\r\n  Is meant to raise visibilty on the case that a generator is not fully exhausted and the contextmanager is not cleaned up properly.\r\n  A contextmanager must yield a non-constant value and not handle cleanup for GeneratorExit.\r\n  The using generator must attempt to use the yielded context value `with x() as y` and not just `with x()`.\r\n\r\n  Closes #2832\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFalse Negatives Fixed\r\n---------------------\r\n\r\n- If and Try nodes are now checked for useless return statements as well.\r\n\r\n  Closes #9449. \r\n\r\n- Fix false negative for ``property-with-parameters`` in the case of parameters which are ``positional-only``, ``keyword-only``, ``variadic positional`` or ``variadic keyword``.\r\n\r\n  Closes #9584 \r\n\r\n\r\nFalse Positives Fixed\r\n--------------------\r\n\r\n- pylint now understands the ``@overload`` decorator return values better.\r\n\r\n  Closes #4696\r\n  Refs #9606\r\n\r\nPerformance Improvements\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n- Ignored modules are now not checked at all, instead of being checked and then\r\n  ignored. This should speed up the analysis of large codebases which have\r\n  ignored modules.\r\n\r\n  Closes #9442 \r\n\r\n- ImportChecker's logic has been modified to avoid context files when possible. This makes it possible\r\n  to cache module searches on astroid and reduce execution times.\r\n\r\n  Refs #9310. \r\n\r\n- An internal check for ``trailing-comma-tuple`` being enabled for a file or not is now\r\n  done once per file instead of once for each token.\r\n\r\n  Refs #9608.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pylint-dev/pylint/issues/9619/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pylint-dev/pylint/issues/9619/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
