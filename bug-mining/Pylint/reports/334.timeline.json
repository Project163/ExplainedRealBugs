> That would be the [`--fail-on` option](https://pylint.pycqa.org/en/latest/user_guide/configuration/all-options.html#fail-on), or #2293 for a more modular fix. Not sure if we should add a link to this option on all the informational message.\r\n> \r\n> Thanks for your quick answer and the hint to the --fail-on option.\r\n\r\nI've tested with --fail-on and pylint then returns with exit code 1.\r\nBut the pylint_runner then still returns with exit code 0.\r\npylint_runner uses \"sys.exit(run.linter.msg_status)\"\r\nI assume that pylint returns still 0 in its msg_status\r\nWhere does this problem then have to be fixed?\r\nIs it a pylint problem? Should pylint set a msg_status != 0 so that pylint_runner would also return with exit code != 0?\r\nI have not debugged anything.\r\nI just had a quick look at the pylint_runner code.\r\nSo this is just my assumption for the moment.","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pylint-dev/pylint/issues/comments/1774516756/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"alfish2000","id":10742843,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNzQyODQz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10742843?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alfish2000","html_url":"https://github.com/alfish2000","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alfish2000/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alfish2000/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alfish2000/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alfish2000/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alfish2000/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alfish2000/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alfish2000/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alfish2000/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alfish2000/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pylint-dev/pylint/issues/comments/1775239966","html_url":"https://github.com/pylint-dev/pylint/issues/9171#issuecomment-1775239966","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pylint-dev/pylint/issues/9171","id":1775239966,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAtdnV85p0AMe","user":{"login":"jacobtylerwalls","id":38668450,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4NjY4NDUw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/38668450?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jacobtylerwalls","html_url":"https://github.com/jacobtylerwalls","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jacobtylerwalls/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jacobtylerwalls/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jacobtylerwalls/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jacobtylerwalls/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jacobtylerwalls/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jacobtylerwalls/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jacobtylerwalls/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jacobtylerwalls/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jacobtylerwalls/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-10-23T13:47:30Z","updated_at":"2023-10-23T13:47:49Z","body":"`pylint_runner` is maintained by [someone else](https://github.com/MasterOdin/pylint_runner).

pylint in this case there is this special handling in run.py:\r\n```\r\n            elif linter.any_fail_on_issues():\r\n                # We need to make sure we return a failing exit code in this

relies on this msg_status.\r\nIt does not implement this special handling which pylint has implemented.\r\npylint_runner is calling:\r\n```\r\n        run = pylint.lint.Run(self.args + pylint_files,

return non-zero in its msg_status if e.g. --fail-on=useless-suppression is specified.\r\nSo this special handling of returning 1 would not be required and as additional benefit a third party app like pylint_runner would just work out of the box without having to implement any additional special
