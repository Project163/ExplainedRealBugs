Overview & Major Changes\r\n- Updates the pylint config to match the template used by newer pylint versions (to ease diffing with default config, for example);\r\n- Prepares the pylint config of coretools to be used as global default for all Arch projects.\r\nRelated issue: https://github.com/iotile/archfx_cloud/issues/251\r\nRelated PR: https://github.com/iotile/archfx_cloud/pull/373\r\n(No need to read through all discussion there, but may provide some context.)\r\n\r\n### Additional Notes\r\nIn case total PR would be confusing (since sections moved around, many style changes), individual commits show atomic, readable changes.\r\nAll commits until `2cdf9bd`: only style updates.\r\n`3378d64` to `9972322`: new (from newer pylint versions) defaults.\r\n`c4505db` onwards: non-default changes, each one explained in commit message.\r\nCan be squashed after review if that's the preferred approach.\r\n\r\n#### Unsolved challenge\r\nSince subprojects inside this repo are not Python packages, the `.pylintrc` is not automatically applied when current directory is not top-level.\r\nExample:\r\n`$ pylint iotilecore/iotile/core/utilities/async_tools`\r\nPWD is `<coretools>` (project root). This command will use the top-level `.pylintrc`.\r\n`$ pylint async_tools`\r\nPWD is `<coretools>/iotilecore/iotile/core/utilities`. This command will NOT use the top-level `.pylintrc`, because Pylint looks for an rcfile in parent directories only as long as each of them is a package. `iotilecore` directory is not a package (has no `__init__.py`) and search stops there, at which point Pylint defaults to a built-in config.\r\n\r\nWays to deal with it:\r\n1. Specify rcfile directly (either via `--rcfile` argument or via `PYLINTRC` env variable). Somewhat cumbersome. If using an editor with Pylint support, depends on editor's ability to run different command/set of env variables per project;\r\n2. Add a symlink to the main rcfile to each subproject. Will work fine, but depends on contributor's OS/FS to support symlinks. Windows with NTFS should be able to handle it, OS X/Linux with most filesystems, obviously, too;\r\n3. Add an `__init__.py` file to each subproject. Will work fine, should be OS/FS-independent. Seems like a best approach to me, but maybe breaks some Python packaging (`setup.py`/`setup.cfg`) logic?\r\n4. Pylint should soon add an `rcfile` option to the pylintrc. This will allow to 'include' other rcfiles, and so we could have a `.pylintrc` in each subproject that would have a single `rcfile=../.pylintrc` line in it. Depends on Pylint upstream and on contributors using the newest Pylint version, though.\r\n\r\nShould I go for 2 or 3, or do we proceed with 1 with no further changes?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/iotile/coretools/issues/906/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/iotile/coretools/issues/906/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pylint-dev/pylint/issues/comments/596486264","html_url":"https://github.com/pylint-dev/pylint/issues/1535#issuecomment-596486264","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pylint-dev/pylint/issues/1535","id":596486264,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU5NjQ4NjI2NA==","user":{"login":"ashb","id":34150,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MTUw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34150?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb","html_url":"https://github.com/ashb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-03-09T12:02:56Z","updated_at":"2020-03-09T12:03:53Z","body":"A
