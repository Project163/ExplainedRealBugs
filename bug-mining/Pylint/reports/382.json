Bug description\n\nSuppose I create 2 files with the same content:\n```\nfrom pathlib import Path\n\nA = Path(\".\")\n\nA = A / \"test\"\n```\n\nIf I run `pylint --load-plugins pylint.extensions.code_style -j 1 --enable R --disable C x.py y.py`, I get some R6104 lints as desired:\n```\n% pylint --load-plugins pylint.extensions.code_style -j 1 --enable R --disable C x.py

assign directly (consider-using-augmented-assign)\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\nYour code has been rated at 6.67/10 (previous run: 10.00/10,
