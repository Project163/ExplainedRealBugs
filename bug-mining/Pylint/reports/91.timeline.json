[x] Write a good description on what the PR does.\r\n\r\n## Description\r\n\r\nThis is a follow up to PR #3497 _Fix class scope issues in undefined-variable checker_. The earlier PR fixed false positives in which function annotations and decorators were being incorrectly reported as unable to access the class scope due to being incorrectly treated as within the function. This PR fixes false negatives that were caused by still searching the function scope.\r\n\r\nIssue #1082, while reported as a false positive for `used-before-assignment` is really due to a false negative for `undefined-variable`. Issue #3461 was partially addressed by PR #3497, and this PR fixes the false negative case where we were not reporting type hints that reference the function parameter `self` (there are still lots of other open type hint issues, but this fixes the specific case reported). Issue #3434 was due to skipping only a single scope level when checking a class's base class list, when there could in fact be an arbitrary number of nested list comprehensions in between. This logic has been moved to a per-scope check similar to the way function annotations and decorators are now checked.\r\n\r\nTo implement this fix, it was necessary to keep track of the frame/scope `node` in `NamesConsumer`, as this may be different to the immediate frame/scope of the variable being checked.\r\n\r\n## Type of Changes\r\n<!-- Leave the corresponding lines for the applicable type of change: -->\r\n|   | Type |\r\n| ------------- | ------------- |\r\n| ✓  | :bug: Bug fix  |\r\n\r\n## Related Issue\r\n\r\nClose #1082, #3434, #3461\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pylint-dev/pylint/issues/3713/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pylint-dev/pylint/issues/3713/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":3537205676,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MzUzNzIwNTY3Ng==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pylint-dev/pylint/issues/events/3537205676","actor":{"login":"Pierre-Sassoulas","id":5493666,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0OTM2NjY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5493666?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pierre-Sassoulas","html_url":"https://github.com/Pierre-Sassoulas","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pierre-Sassoulas/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pierre-Sassoulas/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pierre-Sassoulas/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pierre-Sassoulas/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pierre-Sassoulas/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pierre-Sassoulas/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pierre-Sassoulas/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pierre-Sassoulas/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pierre-Sassoulas/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-07-12T15:37:54Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3537205699,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDM1MzcyMDU2OTk=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pylint-dev/pylint/issues/events/3537205699","actor":{"login":"Pierre-Sassoulas","id":5493666,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0OTM2NjY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5493666?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pierre-Sassoulas","html_url":"https://github.com/Pierre-Sassoulas","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pierre-Sassoulas/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pierre-Sassoulas/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pierre-Sassoulas/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pierre-Sassoulas/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pierre-Sassoulas/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pierre-Sassoulas/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pierre-Sassoulas/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pierre-Sassoulas/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pierre-Sassoulas/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"b0824e94019ac86df0164bba26389488090479e5","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pylint-dev/pylint/commits/b0824e94019ac86df0164bba26389488090479e5","created_at":"2020-07-12T15:37:55Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
