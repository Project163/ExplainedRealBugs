I guess I got confused, the other day. My apologies.\r\n\r\nTrying to silence flake8, this\r\n\r\n```python\r\n    data = self._wrapper_class(data)  # pylint: disable=not-callable  # noqa\r\n```\r\n\r\ntriggers the `not-callable` error. Apparently, pylint loses its pragma in the process.\r\n\r\nThis:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n    data = self._wrapper_class(data)  # pylint: disable=not-callable noqa\r\n```\r\n\r\ntriggers line too long from flake8.\r\n\r\nThis yields no error:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n    data = self._wrapper_class(data)  # noqa # pylint: disable=not-callable\r\n    # or even shorter\r\n    data = self._wrapper_class(data)  # noqa pylint: disable=not-callable\r\n```\r\n\r\nIs this the recommended approach?\r\n\r\nI think the cons are that\r\n\r\n- (A bit) too verbose: I'd rather avoid the `# noqa`\r\n- It disables flake8 for the whole line, not only the `line too long` rule\r\n- I'd rather have `# noqa` at the end and keep more important stuff (not callable) closer to the code\r\n\r\nI realize that this is not a pylint issue as I thought but rather a pylint/flake8 issue. Anyway, let alone flake8, it is a pity that pylint, while enforcing coding style, generates exceptions to its own rules. Even if it auto-ignores its pragmas while enforcing the `line-too-long` rule, the line is still too long for the editor. Maybe not as bad for a comment as it would be for actual code, but still.\r\n\r\nFrom this perspective, I still think a pragma that would disable a rule for the next line would be nice.\r\n\r\nI won't argue about it, though, because I don't know pylint's code architecture and this might be a huge breaking change for little benefit. Besides, I'm not an experienced pylint user, so my vision might be biased towards my use case.\r\n\r\nI'm also interested in knowing which alternative has consensus among the community. Should I be writing it like this ?\r\n\r\n```python\r\n    data = self._wrapper_class(data)  # noqa pylint: disable=not-callable\r\n```\r\n\r\nFeel free to redirect me to stackoverflow if I'm abusing the bugtracker for what looks more like a question.","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pylint-dev/pylint/issues/comments/333307565/reactions","total_count":6,"+1":6,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"lafrech","id":1767010,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NjcwMTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1767010?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lafrech","html_url":"https://github.com/lafrech","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lafrech/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lafrech/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lafrech/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lafrech/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lafrech/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lafrech/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lafrech/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lafrech/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lafrech/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":1320917627,"node_id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDEzMjA5MTc2Mjc=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pylint-dev/pylint/issues/events/1320917627","actor":{"login":"rogalski","id":9485217,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk0ODUyMTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9485217?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rogalski","html_url":"https://github.com/rogalski","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rogalski/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rogalski/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rogalski/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rogalski/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rogalski/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rogalski/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rogalski/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rogalski/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rogalski/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2017-11-01T12:46:37Z","label":{"name":"question","color":"cc317c"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pylint-dev/pylint/issues/comments/343143189","html_url":"https://github.com/pylint-dev/pylint/issues/1682#issuecomment-343143189","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pylint-dev/pylint/issues/1682","id":343143189,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM0MzE0MzE4OQ==","user":{"login":"andy-maier","id":8939758,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg5Mzk3NTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8939758?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/andy-maier","html_url":"https://github.com/andy-maier","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andy-maier/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andy-maier/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andy-maier/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andy-maier/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andy-maier/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andy-maier/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andy-maier/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andy-maier/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andy-maier/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-11-09T12:42:27Z","updated_at":"2017-11-09T12:45:02Z","body":"I have run into the same issue and am interested in a solution, and I found how to improve the previously listed solutions by disabling just the line too long issue for flake8:\r\n```\r\nif type(test_dict) not in dict_types:  #

is a feature request.\r\nI have doc comments with URLs in them. Some of these URLs are long (for example canonical Github URLs, with the full commit hash). I want to ignore the `line-too-long` warning for these lines.\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\n1. Write some code with a doc comment containing a long URL\r\n   ```python\r\n   def parse_proc_stat(data):\r\n       \"\"\"\r\n       Parses the content of a `proc/[pid]/stat` file.\r\n       \r\n       :see: https://linux.die.net/man/5/proc\r\n       :see: https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/68abbe729567cef128b2c2141f2ed2567f3b8372/fs/proc/array.c#L528\r\n       \"\"\"\r\n       match = PROC_STAT_PATTERN.match(data)\r\n       ...\r\n       return result\r\n   ```\r\n2. Run pylint on the script, with the default config\r\n\r\n### Current behavior\r\n\r\nI get a `line-too-long` error.\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\n\r\nHave a good way to locally disable this error (see below).\r\n\r\n### pylint --version output\r\n\r\n`1.9.1`\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThe `line-too-long` error is not helpful in this case. The current solutions are either noisy or too extreme.\r\n\r\n**Current solutions**\r\n\r\n1. Disable the `line-too-long` error globally. Either with the CLI flag or with a `# pylint: disable=line-too-long` at the top of the file. This is too extreme: I still want to catch **code** lines that are too long.\r\n2. Disable the error with a trailing directive. This seems to work, even inside doc strings, but trips up other tools using the doc string and makes the line even longer:\r\n   ```python\r\n   def parse_proc_stat(data):\r\n       \"\"\"\r\n       :see: https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/68abbe729567cef128b2c2141f2ed2567f3b8372/fs/proc/array.c#L528  # pylint: disable=line-too-long\r\n       \"\"\"\r\n       return result\r\n   ```\r\n3. Locally disable then re-enable the error by wrapping the doc-string with a pair of `pylint: disable=...` and `pyling: enable=...` directives. This solution does not modify the doc-string or over-extend the line with the URL, but it requires to add two lines of Pylint directives and is very error prone: if you forget/accidentally remove the `enable` directive, the content will not be checked.\r\n   ```python\r\n   def parse_proc_stat(data):\r\n       # pylint: disable=line-too-long\r\n       \"\"\"\r\n       :see: https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/68abbe729567cef128b2c2141f2ed2567f3b8372/fs/proc/array.c#L528\r\n       \"\"\"\r\n       # pylint: enable=line-too-long\r\n       return result\r\n   ```\r\n\r\n**Proposed solutions**:\r\n\r\nI used other linters in other languages (Javascript, Typescript, C++) and I saw two general ways to handle this kind of issues:\r\n- `disable-next` directive. This is the mirror image of `disable`: it ignores errors for the next element instead of the previous one. It allows you to write the directive comment above the failing element. This is also mentioned in [this issue](https://github.com/PyCQA/pylint/issues/1682). This solution can be applied to other checks, it would also allow you to avoid lines mixing both code and comments (code style),\r\n   ```python\r\n   def parse_proc_stat(data):\r\n       # pylint: disable-next=line-too-long\r\n       \"\"\"\r\n       :see: https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/68abbe729567cef128b2c2141f2ed2567f3b8372/fs/proc/array.c#L528\r\n       \"\"\"\r\n       return result\r\n   ```\r\n  You still have to prefix the failing element, but it's less noisy or error prone.\r\n\r\n- `line-too-long-whitelist-regex` option (better names are welcome). Configure the `line-too-long` check with a regex that lets you whitelist some lines. If the regexp matches the line, do not emit the error. For example, I could use a regexp matching URLs but someone else could write its own regexps (I mainly found it used for URLs in other tools). The regexp may fail to distinguish some cases (URL in a doc/comment VS in a string literal) but it's usually good-enough.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pylint-dev/pylint/issues/2178/reactions","total_count":5,"+1":5,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pylint-dev/pylint/issues/2178/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pylint-dev/pylint/issues/comments/564565614","html_url":"https://github.com/pylint-dev/pylint/issues/1682#issuecomment-564565614","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pylint-dev/pylint/issues/1682","id":564565614,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU2NDU2NTYxNA==","user":{"login":"fabiencelier","id":17087544,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MDg3NTQ0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17087544?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fabiencelier","html_url":"https://github.com/fabiencelier","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fabiencelier/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fabiencelier/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fabiencelier/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fabiencelier/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fabiencelier/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fabiencelier/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fabiencelier/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fabiencelier/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fabiencelier/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-12-11T14:23:25Z","updated_at":"2019-12-11T14:23:25Z","body":"Hello,\r\nAny

Current problem\r\n\r\nAs discussed in #1682 `pylint` currently does not consider the length of the disable params when checking for line length.\r\nFor example, when max-length is set to 80 the following code would not raise a `line-too-long` warning.\r\n```python\r\nLine with length of 80 columns  # pylint: disable=not-callable\r\n```\r\nAccording to the issue, this is due to:\r\nhttps://github.com/PyCQA/pylint/blob/14da5ce258d3818037304a6e0f61aba1462e251d/pylint/checkers/format.py#L1004\r\nWhich seems fair.\r\n\r\nHowever, this is not what users might intuitively expect from this warning, as a comment in that issue shows. Some users might want the max-length to also include comments.\r\nAlthough #4797 fixes some of the issues in the original issue, it does not solve this particular issue. This issue serves to track it.\r\n\r\n### Desired solution\r\n\r\nMake `pylint` consider comments when checking for max-length of lines.\r\n\r\n**Open question:**\r\nWhat should be default behaviour? Including comments or excluding comments? Current behaviour is excluding, but I would argue that it would be more intuitive to include them. Especially now that users can use `disable-next` to split comments and code over multiple lines.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pylint-dev/pylint/issues/4802/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pylint-dev/pylint/issues/4802/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":5115193186,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50NTExNTE5MzE4Ng==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pylint-dev/pylint/issues/events/5115193186","actor":{"login":"Pierre-Sassoulas","id":5493666,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0OTM2NjY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5493666?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pierre-Sassoulas","html_url":"https://github.com/Pierre-Sassoulas","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pierre-Sassoulas/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pierre-Sassoulas/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pierre-Sassoulas/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pierre-Sassoulas/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pierre-Sassoulas/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pierre-Sassoulas/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pierre-Sassoulas/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pierre-Sassoulas/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pierre-Sassoulas/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-08-05T04:59:00Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":5115193260,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDUxMTUxOTMyNjA=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pylint-dev/pylint/issues/events/5115193260","actor":{"login":"Pierre-Sassoulas","id":5493666,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0OTM2NjY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5493666?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pierre-Sassoulas","html_url":"https://github.com/Pierre-Sassoulas","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pierre-Sassoulas/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pierre-Sassoulas/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pierre-Sassoulas/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pierre-Sassoulas/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pierre-Sassoulas/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pierre-Sassoulas/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pierre-Sassoulas/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pierre-Sassoulas/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pierre-Sassoulas/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"7d84a322afb129045b5c82790bad56b7d7f4fbc3","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pylint-dev/pylint/commits/7d84a322afb129045b5c82790bad56b7d7f4fbc3","created_at":"2021-08-05T04:59:02Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pylint-dev/pylint/issues/comments/893164775","html_url":"https://github.com/pylint-dev/pylint/issues/1682#issuecomment-893164775","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pylint-dev/pylint/issues/1682","id":893164775,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAtdnV841PJzn","user":{"login":"Pierre-Sassoulas","id":5493666,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0OTM2NjY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5493666?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pierre-Sassoulas","html_url":"https://github.com/Pierre-Sassoulas","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pierre-Sassoulas/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pierre-Sassoulas/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pierre-Sassoulas/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pierre-Sassoulas/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pierre-Sassoulas/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pierre-Sassoulas/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pierre-Sassoulas/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pierre-Sassoulas/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pierre-Sassoulas/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-08-05T04:59:56Z","updated_at":"2021-08-05T04:59:56Z","body":"Follow
