Right now, the [docs](http://pylint.pycqa.org/en/latest/faq.html#is-it-possible-to-locally-disable-a-particular-message) state:\r\n\r\n> add \"#pylint: disable=some-message,another-one\" at the desired block level or at the end of the desired line of code\r\n\r\nI ask this because I was surprised to see that the following does not work:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n        if hasattr(SafeConfigParser, \"read_file\"):\r\n            return SafeConfigParser.read_file(self, fp, filename)\r\n        else:\r\n            # pylint: disable=deprecated-method\r\n            return SafeConfigParser.readfp(self, fp, filename)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe `deprecated-method` warning is still raised.\r\n\r\nHowever, the following _does_ work:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n        try:\r\n            return SafeConfigParser.read_file(self, fp, filename)\r\n        except AttributeError:\r\n            # pylint: disable=deprecated-method\r\n            return SafeConfigParser.readfp(self, fp, filename)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe `deprecated-method` warning is disabled, as desired. In the `if/else` case, I had to add the `# \r\n pylint: disable=` line to block that contains the `if/else` instead.","closed_by":{"login":"Pierre-Sassoulas","id":5493666,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0OTM2NjY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5493666?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pierre-Sassoulas","html_url":"https://github.com/Pierre-Sassoulas","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pierre-Sassoulas/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pierre-Sassoulas/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pierre-Sassoulas/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pierre-Sassoulas/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pierre-Sassoulas/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pierre-Sassoulas/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pierre-Sassoulas/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pierre-Sassoulas/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pierre-Sassoulas/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pylint-dev/pylint/issues/2452/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pylint-dev/pylint/issues/2452/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
