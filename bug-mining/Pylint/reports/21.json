It's just to make the problem easy to see.\n\nAdd a trailing comment to each of the four enable lines in order. When there is a trailing comment on the second enable line, the `bad-indentation` setting is silently ignored.\n\n```\n# pylintrc\n[MESSAGES CONTROL]\ndisable=all\nenable=\n  trailing-whitespace,\n  trailing-whitespace, # this disables bad-indentation\n  bad-indentation,\n  trailing-whitespace,\n```\n### Current behavior\n\nPylint will ignore any option on the line _after_ a line with a comment on it. Moving the comment to a new line will fix it again.\n### Expected behavior\n\nCertainly not that.\n\nThe obvious desired behavior is to not ignore those options.\n\nIt seems that this was discussed before pylint went up on github ( #150 ), but the problem still exists, and it's not documented. It took quite a while to track down.\n### pylint --version output\n\n```\npylint 1.6.4, \nastroid 1.4.7\nPython 2.7.10 (default, Oct 14 2015, 16:09:02) \n[GCC 5.2.1 20151010]\n```\n","closed_by":{"login":"PCManticore","id":448166,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0ODE2Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/448166?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/PCManticore","html_url":"https://github.com/PCManticore","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PCManticore/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PCManticore/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PCManticore/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PCManticore/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PCManticore/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PCManticore/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PCManticore/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PCManticore/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PCManticore/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pylint-dev/pylint/issues/1024/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pylint-dev/pylint/issues/1024/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
