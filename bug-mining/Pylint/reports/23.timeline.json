idea mentioned in issue #1013. \n\nI am aware it's definitely not ready for merge, but I'd leave it here just to allow idea to sink and to hear feedback from you guys. \n\nThere are additional steps required for this change to be possibly merged:\n- [x] Implement functionality of predefined presets (while keeping possibility of custom overrides by `something_rgx` options)\n- [x] Select coding style presets to be included (possible candidates: snake_case (default), camelCase, PascalCase)\n- [x] Define regular expressions for selected presets (I did not paid much attention to it in `CamelCaseStyle`)\n- [x] Extend test suite for enough coverage\n\nIt may be a good idea to run a change on some big code bases with selected coding styles just to make sure we have covered all corner cases. We should aim for no false-positives (even if some false-negatives occurs), especially given that Pylint 2.0 is supposed to be a lot less nitpicking.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pylint-dev/pylint/issues/1046/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pylint-dev/pylint/issues/1046/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":762015022,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50NzYyMDE1MDIy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pylint-dev/pylint/issues/events/762015022","actor":{"login":"PCManticore","id":448166,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0ODE2Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/448166?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/PCManticore","html_url":"https://github.com/PCManticore","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PCManticore/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PCManticore/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PCManticore/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PCManticore/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PCManticore/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PCManticore/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PCManticore/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PCManticore/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PCManticore/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":"537b1724295dbae620839c62803ca8aab34fe1f7","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pylint-dev/pylint/commits/537b1724295dbae620839c62803ca8aab34fe1f7","created_at":"2016-08-20T08:30:07Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
