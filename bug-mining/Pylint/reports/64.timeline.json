Current problem\n\nSimilar to #1923, but for the return type annotation.\r\nIt is sometimes useful to override a method and change the return type annotation - whether to help a static type checker out or to help the IDE make better autocomplete suggestions.\r\n\r\nHere's an example - it's a bit contrived, I actually ran into this when overriding to add typing to a method from a third-party library (ANTLR).\r\n\r\n```python\r\n\"\"\"Quick test to demonstrate useless-super-declaration raised for overrides\r\nthat change return type annotations.\"\"\"\r\nimport random\r\nfrom dataclasses import dataclass\r\nfrom typing import Any\r\n\r\n# pylint: disable=too-few-public-methods\r\nclass _AGenerator:\r\n    \"\"\"Abstract base class for generators.\"\"\"\r\n    _valid_values: list[Any]\r\n\r\n    def get_random(self) -> Any:\r\n        \"\"\"Generates a random value from the valid values that this generator\r\n        can return.\"\"\"\r\n        return random.choice(self._valid_values)\r\n\r\n@dataclass\r\nclass StrGenerator(_AGenerator):\r\n    \"\"\"Generator that accepts and returns string values.\"\"\"\r\n    _valid_values: list[str]\r\n\r\n    # override to add typing\r\n    def get_random(self) -> str:\r\n        return super().get_random()\r\n\r\ns = StrGenerator(['foo', 'bar', 'qux'])\r\nprint(s.get_random())\r\nprint(s.get_random())\r\nprint(s.get_random())\r\n```\r\n\r\nRunning pylint with default config on it:\r\n```\r\n$ python -m pylint test.py \r\n************* Module test\r\ntest.py:24:4: W0235: Useless super delegation in method 'get_random' (useless-super-delegation)\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nYour code has been rated at 9.33/10 (previous run: 9.33/10, +0.00)\r\n```\n\n### Desired solution\n\npylint should not emit a warning in this case as the override has legitimate uses.\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No
