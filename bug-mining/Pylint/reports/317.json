Current problem\n\nWhen running pylint (`pylint --disable=all --enable=missing-type-doc --load-plugins=pylint.extensions.docparams code.py`) with the following code, no errors are displayed:\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef variant(node: str) -> list[str]:\r\n    \"\"\"Get the variants for the given `node`.\r\n\r\n    Args:\r\n        node: The node to get the variants for.\r\n\r\n    Returns:\r\n        The available variants.\r\n\r\n    \"\"\"\r\n    return [\"hi\"]\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever when type comments are used, a `missing-type-doc` warning is shown:\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef variant(node):\r\n    # type: (str) -> list[str]\r\n    \"\"\"Get the variants for the given `node`.\r\n\r\n    Args:\r\n        node: The node to get the variants for.\r\n\r\n    Returns:\r\n        The available variants.\r\n\r\n    \"\"\"\r\n    return [\"hi\"]\r\n```\n\n### Desired solution\n\nIdeally docparams would allow type comments to count as type documentation, just like regular type annotations are allowed.\r\nThis will require changes on these lines: https://github.com/PyCQA/pylint/blob/a6cb836da56b051cdc0d584d726fb7579415cb54/pylint/extensions/docparams.py#L560-L563\n\n###
