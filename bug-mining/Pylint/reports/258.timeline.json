one's a mouthful, but I did verify that this is still an issue with 2.1.1-23-g0af480e -- current master as of writing.\r\n\r\nConsider this example:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom __future__ import annotations\r\nfrom os import PathLike\r\nfrom typing import Union\r\n\r\n_PathType = Union[str, 'PathLike[str]']\r\n\r\ndef foo(arg: _PathType) -> str:\r\n    return str(arg)\r\n```\r\n\r\nFirst, note that `PathLike[str]` is a case where MyPy uses a Generic type stub, but that the runtime object here is not subscriptable. In these cases, such types *must* be string quoted, even when using delayed annotations support from PEP 563.\r\n\r\nSee here for more information on this circumstance:  https://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/common_issues.html#using-classes-that-are-generic-in-stubs-but-not-at-runtime\r\n\r\nThe warning produced is:\r\n```\r\nexample.py:2:1 'os.PathLike' imported but unused\r\n```\r\n\r\nNext, even when moving this import below a TYPE_CHECKING stanza, pyflakes still warns.\r\n\r\nLastly, this is an error in pylint (https://github.com/PyCQA/pylint/issues/3299) and pycharm (As of 2019.3.2) as well. Worse, each tool has separate pragmas to silence the error.\r\n\r\nThis error appears related to #247 but that was about PEP 484 type hint *comments*, not string quoted type hints. The issue is *possibly* distinct from #510 because PEP 563 delayed annotations have no effect here: quoted types are a requisite; but these two reports may share a root cause. Pull #479 does not resolve this problem.\r\n\r\nHopefully that's good homework.

`VariablesChecker` now checks for possible names in `Const` strings that appear in a typing annotation context. This fixes some false positives for `unused-import` and `unused-variable`.\r\n- string `Const`s used as args to `typing.Literal` aren't treated as names.\r\n- String annotations like `\"os.PathLike[str]\"` or `\"graphlib.TopologicalSorter[T]\"` now
