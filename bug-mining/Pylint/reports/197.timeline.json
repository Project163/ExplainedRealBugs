Refactoring   |\r\n\r\n## Description\r\n\r\nThis one is somewhat pedantic, sorry! I simply noticed that we could attempt to raise more targeted messages so that `undefined-variable` corresponds generally with `NameError` and `used-before-assignment` corresponds generally with `UnboundLocalError`. The only use of the message affected by this PR is new in 2.12, so hopefully not breaking too many existing disables. But I suppose that should be balanced against people suppressing `undefined-variable` that would be glad to get `used-before-assignment` coming through now.\r\n\r\nSee example shell session drawn from existing unit tests adjusted in this PR:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nIn [1]: G: int\r\n   ...: \r\n   ...: \r\n   ...: def a():\r\n   ...:     global G\r\n   ...:     print(G)\r\n   ...: \r\n   ...: \r\n   ...: def bound_value():\r\n   ...:     variable: int\r\n   ...:     print(variable)\r\n   ...: \r\n   ...: \r\n   ...: def decorator_returning_incorrect_function():\r\n   ...:     \"\"\"A decorator that returns a wrapper function with decoupled typing\"\"\"\r\n   ...: \r\n   ...:     def wrapper_with_type_and_no_value():\r\n   ...:         #
