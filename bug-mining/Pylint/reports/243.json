Current problem\r\n\r\nWe introduced new label to know what needs to be done for an issue recently (actionable label starting with \"needs\", \"require\" or \"waiting\") in #6999. We also have a backlog of issues with numerous issues, some outdated (fixed, or not relevant anymore), some duplicated, some where a decision needs to be taken.  Once all issues are labelled it's easier to know what needs to be done and for contributors to help us.\r\n\r\n### Desired solution\r\n\r\nCheck [the issues that do not have any actionable label](\r\nhttps://github.com/PyCQA/pylint/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+-label%3A%22Needs+astroid+Brain+%F0%9F%A7%A0%22+-label%3A%22Needs+astroid+update%22+-label%3A%22Needs+backport%22+-label%3A%22Needs+decision+%3Alock%3A%22+-label%3A%22Needs+investigation+%F0%9F%94%AC%22+-label%3A%22Needs+PR%22+-label%3A%22Needs+reproduction+%3Amag%3A%22+-label%3A%22Needs+review+%F0%9F%94%8D%22+-label%3A%22Needs+triage+%3Ainbox_tray%3A%22+-label%3A%22Waiting+on+author%22+-label%3A%22Work+in+progress%22+-label%3AMaintenance+sort%3Aupdated-desc+-label%3A%22Needs+specification+%3Aclosed_lock_with_key%3A%22+-label%3A%22Needs+design+proposal+%3Alock%3A%22), and label them. If a decision is hard to come by fast then it's possible to add the \"need investigation\" or \"need reproduction\" labels. I encountered some issues that are both high effort and minor and I think we could close those directly (but I did not close them yet).\r\n\r\n\r\n### Additional context\r\n\r\nI've done some digging recently and closed around 40 issues. A third of the issues are labelled with something actionable now. It triaged the oldest issue first so I don't expect to close 80 issues with the two third that are left but every closed issues helps (especially to prevent new duplicate from being created as the broken windows theory apply to the backlog imo).\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"Pierre-Sassoulas","id":5493666,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0OTM2NjY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5493666?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pierre-Sassoulas","html_url":"https://github.com/Pierre-Sassoulas","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pierre-Sassoulas/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pierre-Sassoulas/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pierre-Sassoulas/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pierre-Sassoulas/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pierre-Sassoulas/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pierre-Sassoulas/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pierre-Sassoulas/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pierre-Sassoulas/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Pierre-Sassoulas/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pylint-dev/pylint/issues/7101/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pylint-dev/pylint/issues/7101/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
