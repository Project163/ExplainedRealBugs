I installed pylint last night to add to one of my Python projects in an attempt to create a requirement of maintaining lint-free code when contributing. I was really impressed with the number of rules that pylint has built into it, but also found it very difficult to work out how to configure the settings. \n### Background\n\nI have a lot of experience working in C-based languages and use a tool called [clang-format](http://clang.llvm.org/docs/ClangFormat.html) for maintaining style and lint-free code in my C/C++/Objective-C projects. This tool has a fair number of options and ways you can tweak the rules it uses to match however you want your project to be formatted. You can check out the various options available [here](http://clang.llvm.org/docs/ClangFormatStyleOptions.html).\n### Enhancements\n\nThe major thing that stood out to me about clang-format vs pylint is that pylint has a lot of, what i might call \"higher level\" directives -- stuff that would be caught in C-style languages by the compiler rather than a linter. So while I find the options in pylint to be much more comprehensive in doing analysis on my code, I did find the ability to tweak the behavior of many of the options to be lacking.\n\nFor example, having an option to enable or disable the `trailing-whitespace` check for comment lines would be extremely useful to me. While I do care about extra trailing whitespace on code-lines, I don't care about trailing whitespace that is part of a comment line. Those results throw up false positives a report that can hide more serious issues with the way the code is written.\n\nA number of the options, such as the formatting for method/function/class/variable/etc names, currently uses regex to set the expectations of behavior. I think that a number of built-in default patterns should be able to be used for these in addition to the custom regex rules. I would argue that the vast majority of projects that use pylint would use a handful of common naming conventions that could be standardized across projects. \n\nAnother example of an issue i ran into was that my print statements are formatted as `print('some string')` in order to support compatibility between Python 2 and 3. However, pylint raises a warning on this for unnecessary parenthesis being used. I would rather not disable that linter option but it will give false-positives that actually break the code's intended compatibility with Python 3.\n\nI don't have many other specific examples of enhancements that could be made because I'm still learning how to use pylint and the myriad of options that are available to me with it, but many of the settings could use some more fine-grain control with sets of defaults or optionally enforced parameters. One of the maintainers asked me on Twitter to open an issue about this so there could be some conversation about how these improvements might taken into consideration. I'm curious to know your thoughts about this.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pylint-dev/pylint/issues/1005/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pylint-dev/pylint/issues/1005/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"actor":{"login":"rogalski","id":9485217,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk0ODUyMTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9485217?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rogalski","html_url":"https://github.com/rogalski","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rogalski/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rogalski/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rogalski/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rogalski/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rogalski/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rogalski/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rogalski/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rogalski/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rogalski/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-07-23T19:17:06Z","updated_at":"2016-07-23T19:17:06Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pylint-dev/pylint/issues/1046","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pylint-dev/pylint","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pylint-dev/pylint/issues/1046/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pylint-dev/pylint/issues/1046/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pylint-dev/pylint/issues/1046/events","html_url":"https://github.com/pylint-dev/pylint/pull/1046","id":167198902,"node_id":"MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0Nzg1ODAwNzk=","number":1046,"title":"Use

required for this change to be possibly merged:\n- [x] Implement functionality of predefined presets (while keeping possibility of custom overrides by `something_rgx` options)\n- [x] Select coding style presets to be included (possible candidates: snake_case (default), camelCase, PascalCase)\n- [x] Define regular expressions for selected presets (I did not paid much attention to it in `CamelCaseStyle`)\n- [x] Extend test suite for enough coverage\n\nIt may be a good idea to run a change on some big code bases with selected coding styles just to make sure we have covered all corner cases. We should aim for no false-positives (even if some false-negatives occurs), especially given that Pylint 2.0 is supposed to be a lot less
