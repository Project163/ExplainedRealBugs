for your work on this @mbyrnepr2 . \r\n\r\nQuick question: It looks like the use case described in the first post works, but it doesn't show the \"has-a\" relationship the same way it would for a class instance defined within. \r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n\r\nHere, where the instance of class B is passed to A's initializer, A's \"box\" shows it has a member of type B, but doesn't show this graphically.\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3579441/126878921-6f8b5030-ed01-470f-990a-3a4eae7c6069.png)\r\n\r\n\r\nHere, where an instance of B is created in class A's

a\" relationship to work for type-hinted, passed, arguments?\r\n\r\n_Originally posted by @BenBlumer in
