 - **Inadequate `AllowOriginsFunc` Validation**: When using `AllowOriginsFunc` for dynamic origin validation, ensure the function includes robust checks to prevent unauthorized origins from being accepted. Overly permissive validation can lead to security vulnerabilities. Never allow `AllowOriginsFunc` to return `true` for all origins. This is particularly crucial when `AllowCredentials` is set to `true`. Doing so can bypass the restriction of using a wildcard origin with credentials, exposing your application to serious security threats. If you need to allow wildcard origins, use `AllowOrigins` with a wildcard `"*"` instead of `AllowOriginsFunc`.
 
-Remember, the key to secure CORS configuration is specificity and caution. By carefully selecting which origins, methods, and headers are allowed, you can help protect your application from cross-origin attacks.
