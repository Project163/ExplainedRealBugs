The primary\r\nsubtype, \"plain\", indicates plain (unformatted) text.\r\n\r\n...\r\n\r\nOther subtypes of \"text\" usefully include types that represent\r\nformatted text containing controlled white space (e.g., \"text/tab-\r\nseparated-values\") and text representing markup languages (e.g.,\r\n\"text/html\").\r\n\r\n...\r\n\r\nIt is important to note that \"text\" cannot be assumed to be\r\nanything other than a structured byte sequence whose precise\r\nstructure is not generally known to the recipient.\r\n\r\n...\r\n\r\nThe recommended practice for the Internet is to label human-\r\nreadable content types as \"text/plain\" and most machine-readable\r\nformats as \"application/octet-stream\".\r\n\r\nThis passage implies that \"text\" is a top-level media type that encompasses various subtypes, including \"text/plain\".
