Create route `app.Put(\"/put\", putHandler)`\n2. Create route `app.Get(\"/get\", getHandler)`\n3. At the bottom of `putHandler` have `c.Method(\"GET\"); return c.Redirect(\"/get\")`\n4. Call `/put` with \"PUT\" HTTP method/verb\n5. Notice the redirect is not `GET /get` but `PUT /get` despite method being set in item 3 above\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\n`c.Method(\"GET\")` is respected and overrides the method/verb of the original request (PUT, in this example).\n\n### Fiber Version\n\nv2.52.6\n\n### Code Snippet (optional)\n\n```go\npackage main\n\nimport \"github.com/gofiber/fiber/v2\"\nimport \"log\"\n\nfunc main() {\n  app := fiber.New()\n  app.Get(\"/get\", getHandler)\n  app.Put(\"/put\", putHandler)\n\n  log.Fatal(app.Listen(\":3000\"))\n}\n\n// This will NEVER be called\nfunc getHandler(c *fiber.Ctx) error {\n  c.SendString(\"\")\n}\n\nfunc putHandler(c *fiber.Ctx) error {\n  log.Debugf(\"got here and method it PUT: %v\", c.Method())\n\n  c.Method(\"GET\")\n  log.Debugf(\"now the method is set to GET: %v\", c.Method())\n\n  // This results in a \"PUT /get\" request instead of \"GET /get\"\n  c.Redirect(\"/get\")\n}\n```\n\n### Checklist:\n\n- [x] I agree to follow Fiber's [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/gofiber/fiber/blob/master/.github/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).\n- [x] I have checked for existing issues that describe my problem prior to opening this one.\n- [x] I understand that improperly formatted bug reports may be closed without explanation.","closed_by":{"login":"ReneWerner87","id":7063188,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcwNjMxODg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7063188?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ReneWerner87","html_url":"https://github.com/ReneWerner87","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ReneWerner87/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ReneWerner87/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ReneWerner87/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ReneWerner87/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ReneWerner87/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ReneWerner87/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ReneWerner87/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ReneWerner87/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ReneWerner87/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/gofiber/fiber/issues/3405/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/gofiber/fiber/issues/3405/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
