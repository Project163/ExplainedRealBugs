PR Description\r\n\r\n## Summary of Changes\r\nThis pull request enhances the CORS middleware in the Fiber web framework by introducing improved origin matching, subdomain support, and comprehensive documentation updates.\r\n\r\n## Changes Made\r\n1. **Origin Matching Improvements:**\r\n   - Refactored the `utils.validateDomain` function to handle wildcard subdomain patterns more accurately.\r\n   - Added tests to ensure correct validation of various origin patterns.\r\n\r\n2. **Subdomain Support:**\r\n   - Modified the CORS middleware to support subdomain matching for the `AllowOrigins` configuration.\r\n   - Added tests to verify the behavior of subdomain matching.\r\n\r\n3. **Documentation Updates:**\r\n   - Added detailed documentation explaining how the CORS middleware works, including the handling of different `AllowOrigins` configurations.\r\n   - Highlighted security considerations and best practices to avoid potential vulnerabilities.\r\n   - Included information on handling misconfigurations related to wildcard origins and credentials.\r\n   - Updated the documentation to reflect changes in the middleware's behavior.\r\n\r\n4. **Improved CORS Handling:**\r\n   - Introduced the `setCORSHeaders` function to streamline the management of common behaviors in both simple and pre-flight requests.\r\n   - Restructured the handler function to consistently apply CORS rules through the newly added setCORSHeaders function.\r\n## How It Works Section\r\n- Added a new section in the documentation explaining the functionality of the CORS middleware.\r\n- Described the process of adding CORS headers to responses based on the configuration.\r\n- Clarified the handling of preflight requests and the dynamic evaluation of allowed origins.\r\n\r\n## Security Considerations Section\r\n- Introduced a section emphasizing security considerations when configuring CORS.\r\n- Highlighted potential risks of allowing all origins, credentials exposure, and exposing sensitive headers.\r\n- Provided guidance on proper configurations to mitigate security threats.\r\n\r\n## Testing Updates\r\n- Expanded test coverage to include scenarios related to subdomains, origin validation, and wildcard patterns.\r\n- Added tests for improved coverage of the CORS middleware.\r\n\r\n## Notes for Reviewers\r\n- Please review the changes made to the `utils.validateDomain` function and ensure accuracy in handling wildcard subdomain patterns.\r\n- Verify the correctness of the subdomain matching behavior in the CORS middleware.\r\n- Verify the correctness of the middleware behavior when making simple requests.\r\n- Thoroughly review the documentation updates for clarity, completeness, and adherence to best practices.\r\n- This is targeting v2 branch, we will also need to cherry pick and merge into v3/main.\r\n\r\nThis pull request aims to enhance the functionality, security, and documentation of the CORS middleware in Fiber. Your feedback and suggestions are highly appreciated.\r\n\r\n# Commits\r\n\r\nfix(middleware/cors): handling and wildcard subdomain matching\r\ndocs(middleware/cors): add 'How it works' and 'Security Considerations'\r\nchore: grammar\r\nchore: fix misspelling\r\ntest(middleware/cors): combine Invalid_Origins tests\r\nrefactor(middleware/cors): headers handling\r\n\r\n<!-- This is an auto-generated comment: release notes by coderabbit.ai -->\n## Summary by CodeRabbit\n\n- **New Features**\n\t- Enhanced CORS middleware support including subdomain matching and dynamic origin evaluation.\n- **Bug Fixes**\n\t- Corrected `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` header handling based on `AllowCredentials`.\n- **Refactor**\n\t- Improved CORS middleware code organization with a new function for setting

PR Description:\r\n\r\nThis PR improves the configuration handling for CORS middleware by ensuring that configuration options related to allowed origins, methods, headers, and exposed headers are consistently treated as lists. This change provides better clarity and flexibility when specifying multiple values for these options.\r\n\r\n#### Changes Made:\r\n\r\n- **Configuration Enhancement**:\r\n  - Updated the CORS middleware configuration to treat allowed origins (`AllowOrigins`), methods (`AllowMethods`), headers (`AllowHeaders`), and exposed headers (`ExposeHeaders`) as lists of strings.\r\n  - Modified the `Config` struct to use slice types (`[]string`) for these configuration options, allowing multiple values to be specified.\r\n\r\n#### Notes for Review:\r\n\r\n- **Consistency Check**: Review the changes to ensure that the configuration options are consistently handled as lists throughout the CORS middleware implementation.\r\n- **Compatibility**: Consider any compatibility implications with existing configurations or usage patterns.\r\n- **Documentation Update**: Confirm that relevant documentation (e.g., README, inline comments) is updated to reflect the new configuration approach.\r\n- **Testing**: Verify that existing tests cover the updated configuration handling and ensure that the middleware behaves correctly with various list-based configurations.\r\n\r\nPlease review the PR and provide feedback.
