The RequestID middleware should be consistent with that.\r\nThis allows to use a custom type for context keys, like for other keys. The RequestID is likely read back somewhere else along other context keys.\n\n### How to Reproduce\n\nSee https://docs.gofiber.io/api/middleware/requestid#config\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nhttps://docs.gofiber.io/api/middleware/requestid#config should have `ContextKey interface{}`\n\n### Fiber Version\n\nv2.42.0\n\n### Code Snippet (optional)\n\n_No response_\n\n### Checklist:\n\n- [X] I agree to follow Fiber's [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/gofiber/fiber/blob/master/.github/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).\n- [X] I have checked for existing issues that describe my problem prior to opening this one.\n- [X] I understand that improperly formatted bug reports may be closed without explanation.","closed_by":{"login":"ReneWerner87","id":7063188,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcwNjMxODg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7063188?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ReneWerner87","html_url":"https://github.com/ReneWerner87","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ReneWerner87/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ReneWerner87/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ReneWerner87/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ReneWerner87/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ReneWerner87/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ReneWerner87/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ReneWerner87/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ReneWerner87/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ReneWerner87/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/gofiber/fiber/issues/2356/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/gofiber/fiber/issues/2356/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
