Description\r\n\r\nThis feature adds buffered streaming support to Fiber v3 through the new Ctx method `SendStreamWriter`:\r\n\r\n```go\r\nfunc (c Ctx ) SendStreamWriter(streamWriter func(w *bufio.Writer))\r\n```\r\n\r\n`c.SendStreamWriter()` essentially is a wrapper for calling fasthttp's [`SetBodyStreamWriter`](https://github.com/valyala/fasthttp/blob/master/server.go#L1506) method. This feature wraps this method in the same way that [`c.SendStream()`](https://github.com/gofiber/fiber/blob/main/ctx.go#L1662) wraps fasthttp's [`SetBodyStream()`](https://github.com/valyala/fasthttp/blob/master/server.go#L1491).\r\n\r\nWith this feature, Fiber users can send shorter segments of content over persistent HTTP connections. This functionality is important for several web-based applications such as:\r\n\r\n- Server-Side Events (SSE)\r\n- Large File Downloads\r\n\r\nFor example, a simple self-contained SSE example using this new feature can be setup as the following:\r\n\r\n```go\r\nhomeHtml := `<!DOCTYPE html>\r\n<html>\r\n    <body>\r\n        <h1>SSE Messages</h1>\r\n        <div id=\"result\"></div>\r\n\r\n        <script>\r\n            if (typeof(EventSource) !== \"undefined\") {\r\n                var source = new EventSource(\"http://127.0.0.1:3000/sse\");\r\n                source.addEventListener(\"my-event\", function(event) {\r\n                    document.getElementById(\"result\").innerHTML += event.data + \"<br>\";\r\n                });\r\n            } else {\r\n                document.getElementById(\"result\").innerHTML = \"Sorry, your browser does not support server-sent events...\";\r\n            }\r\n        </script>\r\n    </body>\r\n</html>\r\n`\r\napp := fiber.New()\r\napp.Get(\"/\", func(c fiber.Ctx) error {\r\n    c.Set(\"Content-Type\", fiber.MIMETextHTMLCharsetUTF8)\r\n    return c.SendString(homeHtml)\r\n})\r\n\r\napp.Get(\"/sse\", func (c fiber.Ctx) error {\r\n    c.Set(\"Content-Type\", \"text/event-stream\")\r\n    c.Set(\"Cache-Control\", \"no-cache\")\r\n    c.Set(\"Connection\", \"keep-alive\")\r\n    c.Set(\"Transfer-Encoding\", \"chunked\")\r\n\r\n    return c.Status(fiber.StatusOK).SendStreamWriter(func (w *bufio.Writer) {\r\n        for {\r\n            fmt.Fprintf(w, \"event: my-event\\ndata: %s\\n\\n\", time.Now().Local())\r\n            if err := w.Flush(); err != nil {\r\n                return\r\n            }\r\n            time.Sleep(time.Second)\r\n        }\r\n    })\r\n})\r\n```\r\n\r\nFixes #3127 \r\n\r\n## Type of change\r\n\r\nPlease delete options that are not relevant.\r\n\r\n- [X] New feature (non-breaking

@grivera64 Couldnt this be a param in `app.Test()` ?\n\nAdding this as a param to the existing `app.Test()` method would require refactoring previous uses of it. To avoid this, I had proposed to make a separate method for it.\n\nAs it is a major update (v2->v3), this could be a permissible breaking change if it would make more sense to keep it as one method in the long run.\n\nIf it were to be the same method, we could change:\n\n```go\n\nfunc (app *App) Test(req *http.Request, timeout ...time.Duration) (*http.Response, error)\n```\n\nto something like:\n\n```go\nfunc (app *App) Test(req *http.Request, errOnTimeout bool, timeout ...time.Duration) (*http.Response, error)\n```\n\nOr:\n\n```go\nfunc (app *App) Test(req *http.Request, config ...*TestConfig) (*http.Response, error)\n```\n\nWhere `TestConfig` is a structure that has the errOnTimeout and timeout parameters as public fields.\n\nWas this what you were referring to @gaby
