Bug Description\r\n\r\n> I'm filing this as a bug since I think the behaviour is counter-intuitive.\r\n\r\nThe logger middleware has a configuration with a default format: https://github.com/gofiber/fiber/blob/2374cad3cd109d3bf33f5863e6eb14c32de1882e/middleware/logger/config.go#L89\r\n\r\nHowever, when the logger proceeds to print this, it ignores the actual format: https://github.com/gofiber/fiber/blob/2374cad3cd109d3bf33f5863e6eb14c32de1882e/middleware/logger/logger.go#L141-L174\r\n\r\nDespite it checking for if it should use the default format, it then uses a different format string in the `fmt.Sprintf()` calls.\r\n\r\n### How to Reproduce\r\n\r\n* Add the logging middleware without overriding the `Format`\r\n* Do a request and observe the log output\r\n\r\n### Expected Behavior\r\n\r\nLogged line should use the `ConfigDefault.Format` for output, as shown in the configuration: https://docs.gofiber.io/api/middleware/logger#default-config\r\n\r\n### Fiber Version\r\n\r\nv2.50.0\r\n\r\n### Code Snippet (optional)\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Checklist:\r\n\r\n- [X] I agree to follow Fiber's [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/gofiber/fiber/blob/master/.github/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).\r\n- [X] I have checked for existing issues that describe my problem prior to opening this one.\r\n- [X] I understand that improperly formatted bug reports may be closed without
