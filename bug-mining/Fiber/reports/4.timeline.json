**New**\r\n-\r\n- [ctx.Route().Params](https://docs.gofiber.io/ctx#route) are now public https://github.com/gofiber/fiber/pull/545 @zerbitx\r\n- [app.Settings.UnescapePath](https://docs.gofiber.io/app#settings)\r\nConverts all encoded characters in the route back before setting the path for the context, so that the routing can also work with urlencoded special characters https://github.com/gofiber/fiber/pull/506\r\n- Abstract [fiber.Router interface](https://godoc.org/github.com/gofiber/fiber#Router) for `App` & `Group` https://github.com/gofiber/fiber/pull/476\r\n- [app.Settings.ReadBufferSize](https://docs.gofiber.io/app#settings)\r\nPer-connection buffer size for requests' reading. This also limits the maximum header size. Increase this buffer if your clients send multi-KB RequestURIs and/or multi-KB headers (for example, BIG cookies).\r\n- [app.Settings.WriteBufferSize](https://docs.gofiber.io/app#settings)\r\nPer-connection buffer size for responses' writing.\r\n- [app.Settings.Views](https://github.com/gofiber/fiber/blob/master/app.go#L181)\r\nWe added a new template interface named `Views`, [click here to see an example](https://github.com/gofiber/template#example).\r\n_The old Template interface is still backward compatible but it does not support the [new features](https://godoc.org/github.com/gofiber/template/html)_.\r\n- Add [Taiwanese translation](https://github.com/gofiber/fiber/blob/master/.github/README_zh-TW.md) https://github.com/gofiber/fiber/pull/517\r\n- [c.Cookies(key string, defaultValue ...string)](https://docs.gofiber.io/ctx#cookies) pass an optional default value that returns if cookie is not found https://github.com/gofiber/fiber/pull/541\r\n- [c.Params(key string, defaultValue ...string)](https://docs.gofiber.io/ctx#params) pass an optional default value that returns if param is not found https://github.com/gofiber/fiber/pull/541\r\n- [c.Query(key string, defaultValue ...string)](https://docs.gofiber.io/ctx#query) pass an optional default value that returns if query is not found https://github.com/gofiber/fiber/pull/541\r\n- Add more middleware test cases, coverage 84% https://github.com/gofiber/fiber/pull/538\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n🧹 **Updates**\r\n-\r\n- The hyphen (`-`) and the dot (`.`) are now interpreted literally in paths, they can be used along with route parameters for useful purposes. Thank you @ReneWerner87 \r\n```go\r\n// http://localhost:3000/plantae/prunus.persica\r\napp.Get(\"/plantae/:genus.:species\", func(c *fiber.Ctx) {\r\n  c.Params(\"genus\")   // prunus\r\n  c.Params(\"species\") // persica\r\n})\r\n\r\n// http://localhost:3000/flights/LAX-SFO\r\napp.Get(\"/flights/:from-:to\", func(c *fiber.Ctx) {\r\n  c.Params(\"from\")   // LAX\r\n  c.Params(\"to\")     // SFO\r\n})\r\n```\r\n- [ctx.Render(tmpl string, values interface{}, layout ...string) error](https://docs.gofiber.io/ctx#render) https://github.com/gofiber/fiber/issues/441\r\nNow supports an additional `layout string` argument. Special thanks to @bdtomlin\r\n- [gofiber/template](https://github.com/gofiber/template) bumped to `v1.5.0`\r\n- Add SECURITY.md https://github.com/gofiber/fiber/pull/484\r\n- Remove unnecessary badges https://github.com/gofiber/fiber/pull/483\r\n- [app.Prefork](https://docs.gofiber.io/app#settings) is now supported on Windows https://github.com/gofiber/fiber/pull/502\r\n- `app.Handler` is now accessible https://github.com/gofiber/fiber/issues/485 https://github.com/gofiber/fiber/pull/504\r\n- StartupMessage is colorized and now contains more information\r\n![](https://i.imgur.com/uLuIQQd.png)\r\n- Improve router performance https://github.com/gofiber/fiber/pull/518 https://github.com/gofiber/fiber/pull/518 ❤️ @ReneWerner87 \r\n- Bump `gofiber/utils v0.0.9`\r\n- Add [benchmark charts](https://gofiber.github.io/fiber) for internal middleware tests\r\n- Improve `app.Listen` documentation https://github.com/gofiber/fiber/pull/561\r\n- Improve code coverage https://github.com/gofiber/fiber/pull/558 @kiyonlin \r\n- Emoji Commits are now default <https://github.com/gofiber/fiber/pull/552>\r\n- Improve PT translation
