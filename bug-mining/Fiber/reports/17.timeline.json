Description\r\n\r\nRevert the revert of #2742, fix condition check, add a unit test that asserts that the condition is correct, and add a comment about why the default value is `string` instead of the recommended private-type-style.\r\n\r\nSee also the initial discussion and my latest [comment](https://github.com/gofiber/fiber/pull/2731#issuecomment-1837084401) in #2731 - there are several incorrect assumptions about how the context works or should work, which lead to the commit reversal.\r\n\r\nFixes #2356 \r\n\r\n## Specific case example\r\n\r\n* I am a developer of some app that uses fiber, and other libraries, which use `context.Context`.\r\n* I follow the [standard go library documentation's recommendation](https://pkg.go.dev/context#Context) on context keys and use unexported types.\r\n* I cannot use the `requestid` middleware because #2742 has constrained the key to be a `string`.\r\n\r\n## Type of change\r\n\r\nPlease delete options that are not relevant.\r\n\r\n- [x] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n\r\n## Checklist:\r\n\r\n- [x] I have performed a self-review of my own code\r\n- [x] I have commented my code, particularly in hard-to-understand areas\r\n- [x] I have added tests that prove my fix is effective or that my feature works\r\n- [x] New and existing unit tests pass locally with my

Description\r\n\r\n`context` recommends using \"unexported type\" as context keys to avoid collisions https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/gofiber/fiber/v2#Ctx.Locals.\r\n\r\nThe official go blog also recommends this https://go.dev/blog/context.\r\n\r\n`fiber.Ctx.Locals(key any, value any)` correctly allows consumers to use unexported types or e.g. strings.\r\n\r\nBut some fiber middlewares constrain their context-keys to `string` in their \"default config structs\", making it impossible to use unexported types.\r\n\r\nThis PR removes the `string` _constraint_ from all middleware default config structs, allowing to now use unexported types as per the official guidelines. However the default value is still a string, so it's not a breaking change, and anyone still using strings as context keys is not affected.\r\n\r\nDepends on 2750\r\n\r\nFixes #2356 \r\n\r\n## Type of change\r\n\r\n- [x] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n\r\n## Checklist:\r\n\r\n- [x] I have performed a self-review of my own code\r\n- [x] New and existing unit tests pass locally with my changes\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/gofiber/fiber/issues/2751/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/gofiber/fiber/issues/2751/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
