order to permanently avoid the problem of https://github.com/gofiber/fiber/issues/2396, we should start and switch to never return _anonymous_ functions (closures) but return non-anonymous functions instead so no data is shared — never. For middlewares this might look as follows:\r\n\r\n```go\r\n// New creates a new middleware handler\r\nfunc New(config ...Config) fiber.Handler {\r\n\t// Setup, etc.\r\n\r\n\t// Return new handler\r\n\treturn newHandler(list, shared, data, here, config, etc)\r\n}\r\n\r\nfunc newHandler(list, shared, data, here, config, etc) func(c *fiber.Ctx) {\r\n    // Important: Never do anything in here before returning the closure.\r\n    return func(c *fiber.Ctx) {\r\n        // Code of handler as before, but without access to data of setup logic\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n_Originally posted by @leonklingele in https://github.com/gofiber/fiber/issues/2396#issuecomment-1493316102_      ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/gofiber/fiber/issues/2398/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/gofiber/fiber/issues/2398/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
