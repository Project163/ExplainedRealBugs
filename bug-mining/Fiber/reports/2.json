I am aware that this can easily be avoided by simply registering a handler before registering static file handlers, but I don't think it should set a status code of 404 when there *is* a handler that matches the route.\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/30553356/77847649-0aaca400-71bf-11ea-8b3f-0085d906c024.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nIf the route matches one of the registered handlers, it should not set the status code to 404. If this is indeed intended behavior, the handler function should not be called.\r\n\r\n**Steps to reproduce**\r\n1) Run the code belolw\r\n2) Visit localhost:3000\r\n~> Webserver responds with `test`, but returns a status code of 404.\r\n\r\n**Code snippet**\r\n\r\n```go\r\npackage main\r\n\r\nimport (\r\n  \"github.com/gofiber/fiber\"\r\n)\r\n\r\nfunc main() {\r\n  app := fiber.New()\r\n\r\n  app.Static(\"/\", \"./public/\")\r\n  app.Get(\"/\", func (c *fiber.Ctx) {\r\n    c.Send(\"test\")\r\n  })\r\n\r\n  app.Listen(3000)\r\n}\r\n```\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"Fenny","id":25108519,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1MTA4NTE5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25108519?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fenny","html_url":"https://github.com/Fenny","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fenny/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fenny/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fenny/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fenny/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fenny/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fenny/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fenny/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fenny/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fenny/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/gofiber/fiber/issues/250/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/gofiber/fiber/issues/250/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
