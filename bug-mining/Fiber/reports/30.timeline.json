\\*Redirect\\) release' --type go\n```\n\nLength of output: 324\n\n---\n</details>\n\n@ReneWerner87 Looking at Go's standard library (`net/http`), here's how it handles redirects:\n\nThe `Redirect` function in `net/http` simply uses whatever status code is passed to it:\n\n```go\nfunc Redirect(w ResponseWriter, r *Request, url string, code int) {\n    // Redirect logic here\n    // ...\n}\n```\n\nGo's `net/http` doesn't have any default status code for redirects - it uses whatever code is explicitly provided in the function call. It also doesn't perform any special handling for different redirect status codes regarding HTTP method preservation.\n\nIn contrast, Fiber defaults to status code 302 (Found) for redirects when no status code is specified:\n\n```go\nfunc (r *Redirect) release() {\n    r.status = 302\n    r.messages = r.messages[:0]\n    r.c = nil\n}\n```\n\nThis explains the issue - browsers interpret 302 inconsistently. Some preserve the original method (like PUT), while others change to GET. Using 303 (See Other) explicitly tells the browser to use GET for the new request, which is why changing to `fiber.StatusSeeOther` fixed the issue for the user.\n\nFor 307 (Temporary Redirect) and 308 (Permanent Redirect), as you mentioned, browsers must preserve the original HTTP method.\n\n\n\n<!-- <agentComponentType>chat-answer</agentComponentType> -->\n\n<!-- <rawResChunk><answer><details>\n<summary>🧩 Analysis chain</summary>\n\n🏁 Script executed:\n```\n#!/bin/bash\n# Let's look at the Go standard library net/http redirect implementation\ncurl -s \"https://cs.opensource.google/go/go/+/refs/tags/go1.24.2:src/net/http/server.go?q=l%3D2416-2425&ss=go%2Fgo\" | grep -A 20 \"func Redirect\"\n\n# Also let's search for the Fiber redirect implementation\nfd -t f -e go . | xargs grep -l \"func.*Redirect\" | xargs cat | grep -A 30 \"func.*Redirect\"\n```\n\nLength of output: 30227\n\n---\n\n🏁 Script executed:\n```\n#!/bin/bash\n# Let's try to get the Go net/http Redirect implementation more directly\ncurl -s \"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/golang/go/go1.24.2/src/net/http/server.go\" | grep -n -A 25 \"func Redirect\"\n```\n\nLength of output: 2184\n\n---\n\n🏁 Script executed:\n```\n#!/bin/bash\n# Let's also check how Fiber sets the default status code for redirects\nrg -B 5 -A 3 'func \\(r \\*Redirect\\) release' --type go\n```\n\nLength of output: 324\n\n---\n\n\n\n</details>\n\n@ReneWerner87 Looking at Go's standard library (`net/http`), here's how it handles redirects:\n\nThe `Redirect` function in `net/http` simply uses whatever status code is passed to it:\n\n```go\nfunc Redirect(w ResponseWriter, r *Request, url string, code int) {\n    // Redirect logic here\n    // ...\n}\n```\n\nGo's `net/http` doesn't have any default status code for redirects - it uses whatever code is explicitly provided in the function call.

This means that when a redirect happens, web browsers may change the HTTP method (for example, converting a POST into a GET) depending on the browser implementation. To ensure that the original HTTP method is preserved, especially in scenarios where a non-GET method is required, you should explicitly use one of the following status codes:\n  - <code>307 Temporary Redirect</code>\n  - <code>308 Permanent Redirect</code>\n\nFor example, to preserve the HTTP method, use:\n  <code>c.Redirect(\"/new-path\", fiber.StatusTemporaryRedirect)</code>\n\nFor more details, see:\n  - [307 Temporary Redirect](https://www.webfx.com/web-development/glossary/http-status-codes/what-is-a-307-status-code/)\n  - [308 Permanent Redirect](https://www.webfx.com/web-development/glossary/http-status-codes/what-is-a-308-status-code/)\n\n**Planned Improvements for Fiber v3:**\n\nFiber v3 is expected to introduce enhanced configurability.

This can lead to cases where, for example, a POST or PUT request is converted to a GET request by some browsers. To retain the original HTTP method when redirecting, explicitly use status codes 307 (Temporary Redirect) or 308 (Permanent Redirect):\n\n    c.Redirect(\"/your-url\", fiber.StatusTemporaryRedirect)\n    // or\n    c.Redirect(\"/your-url\", fiber.StatusPermanentRedirect)\n\nIf you require the browser to force a GET on redirect, consider using 303 (See Other):\n\n    c.Redirect(\"/your-url\", fiber.StatusSeeOther)\n\nThis behavior is consistent with the standard library's net/http package, which uses the provided status code without altering the HTTP method unless explicitly required.\n\n**Looking ahead to v3:**  \nWhile v2 retains 302 as the default for backward compatibility, Fiber v3 is planned to introduce a global configuration option to set the default redirect status code. This enhancement will allow developers to choose a default that better fits their application's needs. Currently, v3 exhibits the same behavior as v2, so explicit status codes should be provided when deviating from the default.\n        </code>\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>✏️ docs/api/redirect_best_practices.md</summary>\n\nAdd the following markdown sections at the end of the file.\n\n---\n\n<code>\n## Redirect Best Practices in v2\n\nIn version 2, the default redirection behavior uses a **302 Found** status code. However, please note the following points:\n- A 302 redirect may result in browsers changing the HTTP method (for example, converting a POST or PUT into a GET) due to inconsistent browser implementations.\n- To **explicitly enforce a GET** method upon redirection, use <code>fiber.StatusSeeOther</code> (303).\n- To **preserve the original HTTP method** (critical for PUT or POST requests), specify **307 (Temporary Redirect)** or **308 (Permanent Redirect)**.\n\n**Recommendation for v2:**  \nAlways explicitly specify the desired redirect status code in your calls to the redirect function rather than relying on the default 302. This proactive approach avoids unexpected behavior across different clients.\n\n---\n\n## Future Optimizations in v3\n\nFor version 3, we propose the following optimizations to further improve redirect handling:\n- **Global Configuration Option:** Introduce a configuration setting to allow developers to define the default redirect status code globally. This would enable safer defaults without breaking existing applications.\n- **Safer Default Behavior:** Consider defaulting to **303 (See Other)** for scenarios where redirection should enforce a GET method, thereby reducing unintended side effects.\n- **Enhanced Guidelines:** Update the documentation with a detailed comparison of the redirect status codes (302, 303, 307, and 308), including how they impact HTTP method retention.\n- **Backward Compatibility:** Maintain the existing default of 302 in v2 but strongly recommend explicit status code usage, while planning for a smoother transition in v3.\n\n**Does the same problem exist in v3?**  \nYes, the issue with HTTP method changes during redirects persists if the status code is not chosen carefully. The planned v3 improvements are aimed at mitigating these inconsistencies, providing developers with clearer options and safer defaults.\n        </code>\n\n---\n\nReview the updated sections and ensure that any related guidelines in the documentation index are updated accordingly.\n\n</details>\n\n\n\nA summary of the context that CodeRabbit is considering across the codebase:\n\n> This change clarifies that the default 302 status code may not be ideal for non‐GET requests by explicitly noting that the HTTP method might be altered. This information, corroborated by our web search results on the behavioral differences between HTTP status codes, ensures users are better informed when choosing a redirect status.\n\n> This update mirrors the note added in the \"To\" method section to help users understand that the default behavior of 302 might lead to an unexpected HTTP method change when handling non‑GET requests. This guidance is based on our web search analysis regarding browser behavior with HTTP 302 redirects.\n\n> The insertion of this section informs developers about upcoming changes for Fiber v3. It clarifies that while the current behavior (using 302 Found by default) persists, future versions will offer a configuration option to choose a default status code that better preserves the HTTP method as needed.\n\n> Our investigation revealed that Fiber’s default redirect behavior in v2 uses HTTP 302, which may convert POST/PUT requests to GET in some browsers. This behavior contrasts with the explicit use of status codes 307/308, which preserve the original method. While Fiber v2 continues to default to 302 for backward compatibility, our analysis suggests that updating the FAQ documentation is the best approach for v2. In the upcoming Fiber v3, a global configuration option to set the default redirect status code is planned to optimize this behavior. This change will enable users to more clearly choose between preserving HTTP methods (using 307/308) or forcing GET (using 303) on redirects.\n\n- [ ] <!-- {\"checkboxId\": \"32599f3c-a2a5-4bb9-b887-dee90db62b97\", \"radioGroupId\": \"edit-actions-group-2801687906\"} --> ✅ Create PR with these edits\n\n- [ ] <!-- {\"checkboxId\": \"6b3df8e2-79f5-4eb8-9d4a-c7d3a6a5f7b1\", \"radioGroupId\": \"edit-actions-group-2801687906\"} --> 📋 Get copyable edits\n\n- [ ] <!-- {\"checkboxId\": \"1ff584df-7767-46fe-8b5b-0980b49c465f\", \"radioGroupId\": \"edit-actions-group-2801687906\"} --> 🔄 Try a different approach\n\n<!-- <agentComponentType>plan-edits</agentComponentType> -->\n\n<!-- <rawResChunk><rationale>Given the user's request to enhance documentation for v2 and consider optimizations for v3, the relevant files are those that pertain to the redirect functionality and its documentation.

This behavior contrasts with the explicit use of status codes 307/308, which preserve the original method. While Fiber v2 continues to default to 302 for backward compatibility, our analysis suggests that updating the FAQ documentation is the best approach for v2. In the upcoming Fiber v3, a global configuration option to set the default redirect status code is planned to optimize this behavior.

This can lead to cases where, for example, a POST or PUT request is converted to a GET request by some browsers. To retain the original HTTP method when redirecting, explicitly use status codes 307 (Temporary Redirect) or 308 (Permanent Redirect):\n\n    c.Redirect(\"/your-url\", fiber.StatusTemporaryRedirect)\n    // or\n    c.Redirect(\"/your-url\", fiber.StatusPermanentRedirect)\n\nIf you require the browser to force a GET on redirect, consider using 303 (See Other):\n\n    c.Redirect(\"/your-url\", fiber.StatusSeeOther)\n\nThis behavior is consistent with the standard library's net/http package, which uses the provided status code without altering the HTTP method unless explicitly required.\n\n**Looking ahead to v3:**  \nWhile v2 retains 302 as the default for backward compatibility, Fiber v3 is planned to introduce a global configuration option to set the default redirect status code. This enhancement will allow developers to choose a default that better fits their application's needs. Currently, v3 exhibits the same behavior as v2, so explicit status codes should be provided when deviating from the default.\n        </code>\n      </generated_instruction>\n    </step>\n  </steps>\n</fileAction></rawResChunk> -->\n\n<!-- <rawResChunk><fileAction>\n  <fileActionSummary>We are going to update the documentation in <code>docs/api/redirect_best_practices.md</code> to clarify the v2 redirection behavior and its caveats, and to outline the proposed improvements for v3 regarding HTTP method preservation during redirects.</fileActionSummary>\n  <file_name>docs/api/redirect_best_practices.md</file_name>\n  <type>Modify</type>\n  <start_line>1</start_line>\n  <end_line>150</end_line>\n  <steps>\n    <step>\n      <stepNumber>1</stepNumber>\n      <generated_instruction>Add the following markdown sections at the end of the file.</generated_instruction>\n    </step>\n    <step>\n      <stepNumber>2</stepNumber>\n      <generated_instruction>\n        <code>\n## Redirect Best Practices in v2\n\nIn version 2, the default redirection behavior uses a **302 Found** status code. However, please note the following points:\n- A 302 redirect may result in browsers changing the HTTP method (for example, converting a POST or PUT into a GET) due to inconsistent browser implementations.\n- To **explicitly enforce a GET** method upon redirection, use <code>fiber.StatusSeeOther</code> (303).\n- To **preserve the original HTTP method** (critical for PUT or POST requests), specify **307 (Temporary Redirect)** or **308 (Permanent Redirect)**.\n\n**Recommendation for v2:**  \nAlways explicitly specify the desired redirect status code in your calls to the redirect function rather than relying on the default 302. This proactive approach avoids unexpected behavior across different clients.\n\n---\n\n## Future Optimizations in v3\n\nFor version 3, we propose the following optimizations to further improve redirect handling:\n- **Global Configuration Option:** Introduce a configuration setting to allow developers to define the default redirect status code globally. This would enable safer defaults without breaking existing applications.\n- **Safer Default Behavior:** Consider defaulting to **303 (See Other)** for scenarios where redirection should enforce a GET method, thereby reducing unintended side effects.\n- **Enhanced Guidelines:** Update the documentation with a detailed comparison of the redirect status codes (302, 303, 307, and 308), including how they impact HTTP method retention.\n- **Backward Compatibility:** Maintain the existing default of 302 in v2 but strongly recommend explicit status code usage, while planning for a smoother transition in v3.\n\n**Does the same problem exist in v3?**  \nYes, the issue with HTTP method changes during redirects persists if the status code is not chosen carefully. The planned v3 improvements are aimed at mitigating these inconsistencies, providing developers with clearer options and safer defaults.\n        </code>\n      </generated_instruction>\n    </step>\n
