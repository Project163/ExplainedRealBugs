I kinda have it working now, but it's not perfect yet. This afternoon I did some research on msgp and as far as I know, it is not possible to convert the struct into bytes. Therefore, I'm converting the struct into a `map[string]interface{}`, which msgp can convert. My implementation uses [github.com/fatih/structs](github.com/fatih/structs) to convert the structs into maps, after which I tell the program to append the map to the byte[]. \r\n\r\n\r\n```golang\r\n\r\ncase reflect.Struct:\r\n\tm := structs.Map(i)\r\n\tb, err = AppendMapStrIntf(b, m)\r\n\treturn b, err\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis results into the following output when running the snippet from @chinaapus:\r\n```\r\nauth: map[Name: ok]\r\n```\r\n\r\nThere are two things I don't like about this implementation:\r\n\r\n1. We rely on an external, archived library\r\n2. We return a `map[string]interface{}` to the user and as far as I've seen, there is no way to convert a `map[string]interface{}` to a struct, without first defining the structure of the struct. \r\n\r\nThese things can be solved:\r\n\r\n1. We recreate the `structs.Map()` method in our code, as it is the only method out of the library we are using.\r\n2.  We let the user convert the `map[string]interface{}` back into a struct. They'll have to define the structure of the final struct, then there are various methods/libraries to do the conversion itself.\r\n\r\n@Fenny Let me know what you think about the implementation & disadvantages and I'll work on creating a
