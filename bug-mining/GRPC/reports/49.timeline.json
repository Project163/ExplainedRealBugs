differences between 3.13 and 3.14\n\n\n- In 3.14, ` asyncio.get_event_loop_policy().get_event_loop()` now raises `RuntimeError: There is no current event loop in thread 'MainThread'` because there is no event loop\n- In 3.14, `asyncio.get_event_loop_policy()` emits deprecation warning `DeprecationWarning: 'asyncio.get_event_loop_policy' is deprecated and slated for removal in Python 3.16`\n\nThe code below could be changed to swallow the `DeprecationWarning: There is no current event loop` which appears in Python 3.12/3.13 without treating all deprecation warnings as errors. We also need to handle the new `RuntimeError` when there is no event loop when calling  `asyncio.get_event_loop_policy().get_event_loop()`\n\nhttps://github.com/grpc/grpc/blob/116820911e0a0775f3e1be92a6e0896d0c0d61d4/src/python/grpcio/grpc/_cython/_cygrpc/aio/common.pyx.pxi#L186-L194\n\n\nTesting: \n\n```\npython3.14\nPython 3.14.0b1 (main, May  7 2025, 19:23:10) [GCC 14.2.0] on linux\nType \"help\", \"copyright\", \"credits\" or \"license\" for more information.\n>>> import asyncio\n>>> asyncio.get_running_loop()\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"<python-input-1>\", line 1, in <module>\n    asyncio.get_running_loop()\n    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~^^\nRuntimeError: no running event loop\n>>> asyncio.get_event_loop_policy().get_event_loop()\n<python-input-2>:1: DeprecationWarning: 'asyncio.get_event_loop_policy' is deprecated and slated for removal in Python 3.16\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"<python-input-2>\", line 1, in <module>\n    asyncio.get_event_loop_policy().get_event_loop()\n    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~^^\n  File \"/usr/local/lib/python3.14/asyncio/events.py\", line 718, in get_event_loop\n    raise RuntimeError('There is no current event loop in thread %r.'\n                       % threading.current_thread().name)\nRuntimeError: There is no current event loop in thread 'MainThread'.\n>>> asyncio.get_event_loop_policy().new_event_loop()\n<python-input-3>:1: DeprecationWarning: 'asyncio.get_event_loop_policy' is deprecated and slated for removal in Python 3.16\n<_UnixSelectorEventLoop running=False closed=False debug=False>\n>>> exit()\n```\n\n```\n(py3131) partheniou@partheniou-vm-3:~$ python3\nPython 3.13.1 (main, Apr  7 2025, 22:14:29) [GCC 14.2.0] on linux\nType \"help\", \"copyright\", \"credits\" or \"license\" for more information.\n>>> import asyncio\n>>> asyncio.get_running_loop()\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"<python-input-1>\", line 1, in <module>\n    asyncio.get_running_loop()\n    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~^^\nRuntimeError: no running event loop\n>>> asyncio.get_event_loop_policy().get_event_loop()\n<python-input-2>:1: DeprecationWarning: There is no current event loop\n  asyncio.get_event_loop_policy().get_event_loop()\n<_UnixSelectorEventLoop running=False closed=False debug=False>\n>>> asyncio.get_event_loop_policy().new_event_loop()\n<_UnixSelectorEventLoop running=False closed=False debug=False>\n>>> \n\n```\n\nWe would still need to migrate off `asyncio.get_event_loop_policy()` prior to Python 3.16 as stated by the deprecation warning.

that.","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/grpc/grpc/issues/comments/2862715463/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"parthea","id":5184014,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxODQwMTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5184014?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/parthea","html_url":"https://github.com/parthea","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/parthea/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/parthea/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/parthea/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/parthea/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/parthea/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/parthea/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/parthea/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/parthea/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/parthea/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"actor":{"login":"parthea","id":5184014,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxODQwMTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5184014?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/parthea","html_url":"https://github.com/parthea","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/parthea/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/parthea/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/parthea/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/parthea/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/parthea/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/parthea/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/parthea/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/parthea/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/parthea/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-05-08T14:53:22Z","updated_at":"2025-05-08T14:53:22Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/grpc/grpc/issues/39520","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/grpc/grpc","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/grpc/grpc/issues/39520/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/grpc/grpc/issues/39520/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/grpc/grpc/issues/39520/events","html_url":"https://github.com/grpc/grpc/issues/39520","id":3049255080,"node_id":"I_kwDOAacf2M61v_Co","number":39520,"title":"[Python]

PR enables Python 3.14 in all the different tests - Basic tests (Native Python tests), Bazel tests and Distrib tests to build Python 3.14 artifacts. In addition, it also updates all the public facing METADATA versions.\r\n\r\n## Distribtests\r\nRequired pre-requisite changes to enable 3.14 artifacts are covered in #40289 .\r\n\r\n## Bazel tests\r\nEnabling Python 3.14 required updating the rules_python version to a more recent version that supports 3.14. This was done in #40602 \r\n\r\n## Basic tests\r\nThe following errors were caught by the Basic tests when running via Python 3.14 and resolved in this PR:\r\n\r\n### 1) No running event loop for AsyncIO when run outside an async function\r\n```\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n  File \"src/python/grpcio/grpc/_cython/_cygrpc/aio/common.pyx.pxi\", line 184, in grpc._cython.cygrpc.get_working_loop\r\nRuntimeError: no running event loop\r\n```\r\nThis was caught by the `tests_aio.unit.outside_init_test.TestOutsideInit` and `tests_aio.unit.init_test.TestInit` tests, and was also previously reported in #39507 with the root cause.\r\n\r\nFollowing some investigation, the fix is being worked on by @sergiitk  in PR #40293. In order to parallelize the fix and this PR, these 2 tests are currently being skipped for Python 3.14 and above.\r\n\r\n### 2) Pickling error from the `multiprocessing` library\r\n```\r\n_pickle.PicklingError: Can't pickle <function _test_well_known_types at 0x7f3937eee610>: it's not the same object as tests.unit._dynamic_stubs_test._test_well_known_types\r\nwhen serializing dict item '_target'\r\nwhen serializing multiprocessing.context.Process state\r\nwhen serializing multiprocessing.context.Process object\r\n```\r\nThis was caught by the `tests.unit._dynamic_stubs_test.DynamicStubTest` which runs test cases in a subprocess using the `multiprocessing` library.\r\nError root cause:\r\n- The default start method of multiprocessing in linux has changed to `forkserver` instead of `fork` from Python 3.14.\r\n- `forkserver` has a few extra restrictions for picklability as compared to `fork` (Ref: [Python Docs](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/multiprocessing.html#the-spawn-and-forkserver-start-methods))\r\n- All the [test case functions](https://github.com/grpc/grpc/blob/0243842d5d10f624bf8f09f45026dd300805502f/src/python/grpcio_tests/tests/unit/_dynamic_stubs_test.py#L115) in the DynamicStubTest that are provided as `target` to the `multiprocessing.Process` use decorators. This causes problems when pickling them. \r\n\r\nHence to resolve this, we manually set the 'start method' of `multiprocessing` to use the `fork` start method.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/grpc/grpc/issues/40403/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/grpc/grpc/issues/40403/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":19557233845,"node_id":"REFE_lADOAacf2M61lrFkzwAAAASNs7S1","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/grpc/grpc/issues/events/19557233845","actor":{"login":"copybara-service[bot]","id":56741989,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90NTY3NDE5ODk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/44061?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/copybara-service","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"ee5325b9f1eddcb9a76e96b86bfa51e74a573ced","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/grpc/grpc/commits/ee5325b9f1eddcb9a76e96b86bfa51e74a573ced","created_at":"2025-09-08T06:58:18Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":19654020574,"node_id":"REFE_lADOAacf2M61lrFkzwAAAASTeI3e","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/grpc/grpc/issues/events/19654020574","actor":{"login":"asheshvidyut","id":134911583,"node_id":"U_kgDOCAqWXw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/134911583?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/asheshvidyut","html_url":"https://github.com/asheshvidyut","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asheshvidyut/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asheshvidyut/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asheshvidyut/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asheshvidyut/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asheshvidyut/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asheshvidyut/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asheshvidyut/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asheshvidyut/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/asheshvidyut/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"f95db35b4afc9d810009980e965966d5721c8740","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/asheshvidyut/grpc/commits/f95db35b4afc9d810009980e965966d5721c8740","created_at":"2025-09-12T07:35:58Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":19756186317,"node_id":"REFE_lADOAacf2M61lrFkzwAAAASZj3rN","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/grpc/grpc/issues/events/19756186317","actor":{"login":"sreenithi","id":22791051,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNzkxMDUx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22791051?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sreenithi","html_url":"https://github.com/sreenithi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sreenithi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sreenithi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sreenithi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sreenithi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sreenithi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sreenithi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sreenithi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sreenithi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sreenithi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"961e28e0d4e945470e0911f49538c5f6364f6543","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sreenithi/grpc/commits/961e28e0d4e945470e0911f49538c5f6364f6543","created_at":"2025-09-17T17:43:07Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"actor":{"login":"sreenithi","id":22791051,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNzkxMDUx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22791051?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sreenithi","html_url":"https://github.com/sreenithi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sreenithi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sreenithi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"h

of #40403 to v1.75.x.\r\n---\r\nThis PR enables Python 3.14 in all the different tests - Basic tests (Native Python tests), Bazel tests and Distrib tests to build Python 3.14 artifacts. In addition, it also updates all the public facing METADATA versions.\r\n\r\n## Distribtests\r\nRequired pre-requisite changes to enable 3.14 artifacts are covered in #40289 .\r\n\r\n## Bazel tests\r\nEnabling Python 3.14 required updating the rules_python version to a more recent version that supports 3.14. This was done in #40602 \r\n\r\n## Basic tests\r\nThe following errors were caught by the Basic tests when running via Python 3.14 and resolved in this PR:\r\n\r\n### 1) No running event loop for AsyncIO when run outside an async function\r\n```\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n  File \"src/python/grpcio/grpc/_cython/_cygrpc/aio/common.pyx.pxi\", line 184, in grpc._cython.cygrpc.get_working_loop\r\nRuntimeError: no running event loop\r\n```\r\nThis was caught by the `tests_aio.unit.outside_init_test.TestOutsideInit` and `tests_aio.unit.init_test.TestInit` tests, and was also previously reported in #39507 with the root cause.\r\n\r\nFollowing some investigation, the fix is being worked on by @sergiitk  in PR #40293. In order to parallelize the fix and this PR, these 2 tests are currently being skipped for Python 3.14 and above.\r\n\r\n### 2) Pickling error from the `multiprocessing` library\r\n```\r\n_pickle.PicklingError: Can't pickle <function _test_well_known_types at 0x7f3937eee610>: it's not the same object as tests.unit._dynamic_stubs_test._test_well_known_types\r\nwhen serializing dict item '_target'\r\nwhen serializing multiprocessing.context.Process state\r\nwhen serializing multiprocessing.context.Process object\r\n```\r\nThis was caught by the `tests.unit._dynamic_stubs_test.DynamicStubTest` which runs test cases in a subprocess using the `multiprocessing` library.\r\nError root cause:\r\n- The default start method of multiprocessing in linux has changed to `forkserver` instead of `fork` from Python 3.14.\r\n- `forkserver` has a few extra restrictions for picklability as compared to `fork` (Ref: [Python Docs](https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/multiprocessing.html#the-spawn-and-forkserver-start-methods))\r\n- All the [test case functions](https://github.com/grpc/grpc/blob/0243842d5d10f624bf8f09f45026dd300805502f/src/python/grpcio_tests/tests/unit/_dynamic_stubs_test.py#L115) in the DynamicStubTest that are provided as `target` to the `multiprocessing.Process` use decorators. This causes problems when pickling them. \r\n\r\nHence to resolve this, we manually set the 'start method' of `multiprocessing` to use the `fork` start method.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/grpc/grpc/issues/40726/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/grpc/grpc/issues/40726/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":19780685642,"node_id":"REFE_lADOAacf2M61lrFkzwAAAASbBU9K","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/grpc/grpc/issues/events/19780685642","actor":{"login":"sreenithi","id":22791051,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNzkxMDUx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22791051?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sreenithi","html_url":"https://github.com/sreenithi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sreenithi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sreenithi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sreenithi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sreenithi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sreenithi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sreenithi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sreenithi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sreenithi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sreenithi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"74ec067e2839a4625a74b966880737a5085a13cc","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/grpc/grpc/commits/74ec067e2839a4625a74b966880737a5085a13cc","created_at":"2025-09-18T16:51:15Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"actor":{"login":"sreenithi","id":22791051,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNzkxMDUx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22791051?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sreenithi","html_url":"https://github.com/sreenithi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sreenithi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sreenithi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sreenithi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sreenithi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sreenithi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sreenithi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sreenithi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sreenithi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sreenithi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-09-22T06:28:10Z","updated_at":"2025-09-22T06:28:10Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/grpc/grpc/issues/40743","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/grpc/grpc","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/grpc/grpc/issues/40743/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/grpc/grpc/issues/40743/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/grpc/grpc/issues/40743/events","html_url":"https://github.com/grpc/grpc/issues/40743","id":3438594575,"node_id":"I_kwDOAacf2M7M9MoP","number":40743,"title":"Python
