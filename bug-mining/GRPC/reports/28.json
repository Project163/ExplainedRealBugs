result of static analyse of grpc source code with Svace static analyzer I found two similar error with \"null_after_deref\" category (situations where first, a pointer is dereferenced, and then it is compared to null) in round_robin LB policy sources.\r\n\r\nIt affects two similar methods:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/grpc/grpc/blob/0aca67e7d63c04b7466432af3597f18d5bf1e279/src/core/load_balancing/round_robin/round_robin.cc#L349\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/grpc/grpc/blob/0aca67e7d63c04b7466432af3597f18d5bf1e279/src/core/load_balancing/weighted_round_robin/weighted_round_robin.cc#L935\r\n\r\nThe problem is that there is dereference of `endpoint_list_` to get `num_ready_` value in conditional expressions. But below, in body of this block, `endpoint_list_` is compares with `nullptr`. \r\n\r\n```c++\r\nif ( (...) &&\r\n      ( round_robin->endpoint_list_->num_ready_ == 0 ||\r\n       ... ||\r\n       ... ) {\r\n    if (...)) {\r\n      const std::string old_counters_string =\r\n          round_robin->endpoint_list_ != nullptr\r\n              ? ...\r\n              : ...;\r\n     ...\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo, looking only on function context, I have a question: if `round_robin->endpoint_list_`  (or `wrr->endpoint_list_` ) can be `nullptr`, should we check it before get `num_ready_` value?\r\n\r\nIf you look at the history of this code, there was this check in this context in line 341\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/grpc/grpc/blob/1cd6e69347cbf62a012477fe184ee6fa8f25d32c/src/core/ext/filters/client_channel/lb_policy/round_robin/round_robin.cc#L340-L348\r\n\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"copybara-service[bot]","id":56741989,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90NTY3NDE5ODk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/44061?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/copybara-service","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/grpc/grpc/issues/37673/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/grpc/grpc/issues/37673/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
