However, version tags are mutable, so a malicious attacker could overwrite a version tag to point to a malicious or vulnerable commit instead.\r\n\r\nPinning workflow dependencies by hash ensures the dependency is immutable and its behavior is guaranteed.\r\n\r\nThese hashes can be automatically updated by dependabot. You'll receive a single periodic PR updating the hashes and version comments of all Actions with new versions (see [this PR](https://github.com/pnacht/libarchive/pull/9)).\r\n\r\nI'll send a PR pinning the Actions along with this issue.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nDisclosure: My name is Pedro and I work with Google and the [OpenSSF](https://openssf.org/) to improve the supply-chain security of the open-source ecosystem.","closed_by":{"login":"yashykt","id":4181124,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQxODExMjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4181124?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yashykt","html_url":"https://github.com/yashykt","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yashykt/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yashykt/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yashykt/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yashykt/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yashykt/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yashykt/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yashykt/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yashykt/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yashykt/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/grpc/grpc/issues/34929/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/grpc/grpc/issues/34929/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
