Please describe.\r\nVsockets are not currently supported in main line grpc.\r\n\r\nI'm aware the ChromiumOS and Android projects are using forks of GRPC to enable vsockets aka AF_VSOCK sockets, based on the patch found here:\r\nhttps://android.googlesource.com/platform/external/grpc-grpc/+/a0d43cf1a94bc5443ee8ee2499490f6af4da6272\r\n\r\nIt appears Android is referencing an old version of grpc:\r\n```\r\nversion = \"1.16.0-dev\"\r\n```\r\nand I'd like to adopt a newer version. The version currently being used for my project is v1.48.1, and it's not really an option for me to go back to an earlier version.\r\n\r\nHas there been any update since the discussion found here?\r\nhttps://github.com/grpc/grpc/issues/25801\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\nEither a port of the patch mentioned above for a newer version of grpc, or support for vsocks in the grpc main line.\r\n\r\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\r\nMy other options are to use:\r\n1. plain POSIX sockets,\r\n2. implement a custom transport for grpc (may be out of scope for the goal),\r\n3. or try to port the patch above to the new version of grpc.\r\n\r\n### Additional context\r\nI'd like to know whether the vsock support has been ported already to a newer version of grpc in any public fork, and/or whether the support for vsockets is planned. It seems multiple major projects would benefit from this, and support in the main line would reduce fragmentation in absorbing security updates.","closed_by":{"login":"drfloob","id":295906,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5NTkwNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/295906?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/drfloob","html_url":"https://github.com/drfloob","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drfloob/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drfloob/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drfloob/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drfloob/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drfloob/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drfloob/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drfloob/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drfloob/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drfloob/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/grpc/grpc/issues/32738/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/grpc/grpc/issues/32738/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
