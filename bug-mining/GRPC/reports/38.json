What version of gRPC and what language are you using?\r\n\r\ngRPC C++ v1.45.2\r\n\r\nBug exists currently in `master` branch as well.\r\n\r\n### What operating system (Linux, Windows,...) and version?\r\n\r\nLinux Fedora 40\r\n\r\n### What runtime / compiler are you using (e.g. python version or version of gcc)\r\n\r\nClang version 18.1.6 (Fedora 18.1.6-3.fc40)\r\n\r\n### What did you do?\r\n\r\nPassed a global instance of `GlobalCallbacks` into `grpc::Server::SetGlobalCallbacks`.\r\n\r\n### What did you expect to see?\r\n\r\nI expected that the global instance of the `GlobalCallbacks` wouldn't have its deconstructed called twice.\r\n\r\n### What did you see instead?\r\n\r\nApplication segfault as we created a derived class from the `GlobalCallbacks` and the deconstructor alerted of a double deconstruction.\r\n\r\nIssue is that the documentation and the implementation don't match. Documentation states ([see here](https://github.com/swift-nav/grpc/blob/a374ef377da972caf60e057a02a40684eed6b6cb/include/grpcpp/server.h#L88-L93)):\r\n\r\n```cpp\r\n  /// Set the global callback object. Can only be called once per application.\r\n  /// Does not take ownership of callbacks, and expects the pointed to object\r\n  /// to be alive until all server objects in the process have been destroyed.\r\n  /// The same \\a GlobalCallbacks object will be used throughout the\r\n  /// application and is shared among all \\a Server objects.\r\n  static void SetGlobalCallbacks(GlobalCallbacks* callbacks);\r\n```\r\n\r\nIssue is that it states that it \"Does not take ownership of callbacks\", however in the implementation ([see here](https://github.com/swift-nav/grpc/blob/a374ef377da972caf60e057a02a40684eed6b6cb/src/cpp/server/server_cc.cc#L999-L1003)) it does indeed take ownership of the objects lifetime, which is why during deconstruction I noticed this double free behavior.\r\n\r\nSimple fix is to remove the `std::shared_ptr` usage [here](https://github.com/swift-nav/grpc/blob/a374ef377da972caf60e057a02a40684eed6b6cb/src/cpp/server/server_cc.cc#L109).\r\n\r\n### Anything else we should know about your project / environment?\r\n\r\nNo.","closed_by":{"login":"copybara-service[bot]","id":56741989,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90NTY3NDE5ODk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/44061?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/copybara-service","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/grpc/grpc/issues/37607/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/grpc/grpc/issues/37607/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
