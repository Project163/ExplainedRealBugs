some odd errors in our logs that only appear with 1.74, and usually just before the app crashes which I have a feeling are related:\n\n```\n#<Thread:0x00007ded6a194620 run> terminated with exception (report_on_exception is true):\nmethod 'to_s' called on unexpected T_IMEMO object (0x00007ded6a1946c0 flags=0x501a) (NotImplementedError)\n```\n\nand\n\n```\nGRPC::Unavailable: 14:Getting metadata from plugin failed with error: #<NoMethodError: undefined method `source_location' for an instance of Array>. debug_error_string:{UNKNOWN:Error received from peer  {grpc_message:\"Getting metadata from plugin failed with error: #<NoMethodError: undefined method `source_location\\' for an instance of Array>\", grpc_status:14}} (GRPC::Unavailable)\n```\n\nI have not been able to reproduce this locally using `:this_channel_is_insecure` yet, but usually only takes a few minutes in running a basic pubsub consumer in a non-dev environment with proper authentication to trigger the sigsegv.\n\nI'd take this with a pinch of salt as I'm not familiar with the grpc codebase, but pointing an LLM at the stacktrace and the changes in 1.74.0 it refers to https://github.com/grpc/grpc/commit/69f229edd1 as a problematic change due to removing `grpc_rb_channel_mark` which was preventing objects from being GC'ed and that would explain a good chunk of what we're seeing

The repro you supplied has been super helpful and allowed us to identify the fix for the crash. I would like to note that we've been observing the same crash for a long while at Shopify but at a much much lower rate. Until 1.74.0 somehow made it more frequent and until your small repro, we didn't have a clue as to which object wasn't being marked.\n\nYour repro really helped, so thank you very much! 🙏
