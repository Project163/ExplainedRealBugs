trying to release `grpc/grpc-ios` version `v1.75.0-pre1`, we discovered a build issue, see https://github.com/grpc/grpc-ios/pull/341.\n\nError

the gRPC-iOS repo uses this particular boringSSL library: https://github.com/firebase/boringssl-SwiftPM\n\n```\nResolved source packages:\n  gRPC: /Users/runner/work/grpc-ios/grpc-ios\n  abseil: https://github.com/firebase/abseil-cpp-SwiftPM.git @ 0.20250512.1\n  BoringSSL-GRPC: https://github.com/firebase/boringssl-SwiftPM.git @ 0.32.1\n```\n\nwhich has\n\n```\n#define OPENSSL_VERSION_NUMBER 0x1010107f\n\n#define BORINGSSL_API_VERSION 16\n```\n\ndefined in https://github.com/firebase/boringSSL-SwiftPM/blob/0.32.1/src/include/openssl/base.h\n\n\nIt looks like for some reason, the fn `X509_STORE_CTX_set0_trusted_stack` was not defined in that particular boringSSL library. The library does seem to have other `X509_STORE_CTX_set0_*` method but just not `X509_STORE_CTX_set0_trusted_stack`\n\nThe PR which introduces the use of this function between v1.74.x and v1.75.x: https://github.com/grpc/grpc/pull/40476/files#diff-d156f50027c4d27c927b506ac4813b3446b41337e92103513cfab376979aef1d\n\n\nThe default boringSSL library this `grpc/grpc` repo uses (google/boringssl), does have the `X509_STORE_CTX_set0_trusted_stack` function defined: https://github.com/google/boringssl/blob/main/include/openssl/x509.h#L3137\n\n\nAlso logged an issue https://github.com/firebase/boringSSL-SwiftPM/issues/23 to see if that function can be added to that Swift boringSSL library.","closed_by":{"login":"copybara-service[bot]","id":56741989,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90NTY3NDE5ODk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/44061?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/copybara-service","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/grpc/grpc/issues/40665/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/grpc/grpc/issues/40665/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
