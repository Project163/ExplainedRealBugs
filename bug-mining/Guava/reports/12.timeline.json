code has been reviewed and submitted internally. Feel free to discuss on the PR and we can submit follow-up changes as necessary.\n\nCommits:\n=====\n<p> Fix an issue where the InputStream returned by BaseEncoding.decodingStream(Reader) could fail to throw DecodingException while decoding an invalid string.\n\nThis was caused by the default behavior of InputStream.read(byte[], int, int), which swallows any IOException thrown by any call to the single-byte read() method other than the first. To fix it, just override that method with an implementation that does not swallow any exceptions.\n\nFixes https://github.com/google/guava/issues/3542\n\n4e6478d4bec284f047a686b8a16dc2b32628639a\n\n-------\n\n<p> Add more clarification on what \"access\" means in expireAfterAccess().\nPrevious comment doesn't mention \"containsKey()\"\n\nCopied from https://github.com/google/guava/wiki/CachesExplained#asmap\n\nRELNOTES=comment change\n\nf2bd7744e575393f065253c8f1bc2a512d452b63\n\n-------\n\n<p> Document that HashBiMap.containsValue() tends to run in faster-than-linear time (overriding the default documentation from AbstractMap.containsValue()).\n\nFixes #1973\n\n7d57c233c9922ca9adbbef552b5f8f66bd7856f0\n\n-------\n\n<p> Add note about {@code ByteSource.wrap}'s use of the given byte array.\n\nFixes https://github.com/google/guava/issues/2603\n\n9276a79f6e9b012935b791a3e6d0b7f3d00b715b\n\n-------\n\n<p> Fix https://github.com/google/guava/issues/3156 by implementing a proper `CollectSpliterators.flatMapTo{Int,Long,Double}`.\n\nAlso, modify the existing `CollectSpliterators.flatMap` to accept `null` from its `function` by treating it as an empty `Stream`, like `Stream.flatMap` does. Add tests for this behavior.\n\nTo test that the new methods also accept `null` through both their `{Int,Long,Double}Consumer` APIs and their `Consumer` APIs, add `of{Int,Long,Double}` methods to `SpliteratorTester`. They test the given `Spliterator.of{Int,Long,Double}` through both APIs.\n\n0763099e769963bd0d93f865a4e7c3a5b320085a\n\n-------\n\n<p> Temporarily update public_suffix to include web.app\n\nWithout this, developers are not able to set up Google OAuth clients with URLs in Firebase Hosting web.app domain.\n\n41b8aeaeb71cab1a151d4359a409bfd54bb81262","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google/guava/issues/3560/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google/guava/issues/3560/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":2560334191,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDI1NjAzMzQxOTE=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google/guava/issues/events/2560334191","actor":{"login":"netdpb","id":4306377,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzMDYzNzc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4306377?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/netdpb","html_url":"https://github.com/netdpb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/netdpb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/netdpb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/netdpb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/netdpb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/netdpb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/netdpb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/netdpb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/netdpb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/netdpb/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"7d57c233c9922ca9adbbef552b5f8f66bd7856f0","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google/guava/commits/7d57c233c9922ca9adbbef552b5f8f66bd7856f0","created_at":"2019-08-15T18:37:03Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2562927398,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MjU2MjkyNzM5OA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google/guava/issues/events/2562927398","actor":{"login":"netdpb","id":4306377,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzMDYzNzc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4306377?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/netdpb","html_url":"https://github.com/netdpb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/netdpb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/netdpb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/netdpb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/netdpb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/netdpb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/netdpb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/netdpb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/netdpb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/netdpb/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-08-16T17:24:22Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2562928591,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDI1NjI5Mjg1OTE=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google/guava/issues/events/2562928591","actor":{"login":"netdpb","id":4306377,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzMDYzNzc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4306377?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/netdpb","html_url":"https://github.com/netdpb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/netdpb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/netdpb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/netdpb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/netdpb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/netdpb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/netdpb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/netdpb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/netdpb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/netdpb/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"e2ee9b73506eee7b15cdd9011b82ad88f432c615","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google/guava/commits/e2ee9b73506eee7b15cdd9011b82ad88f432c615","created_at":"2019-08-16T17:24:53Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
