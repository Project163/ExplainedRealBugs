I played around with it and found it to be remarkably accurate for large and small, empty and full filters alike. I was seeing accuracy between 2 and 5 9's based on the size of the filters.\r\n\r\nI'd be happy to implement it (properly) if needed. I think there is value in this addition, and since it's just a calculation with some internal values, I don't see any major downsides. I suppose there isn't a way to quantify the accuracy of the results, but between Javadoc and a descriptive method name (like in \"mightContain\") the approximate nature of the result could be clear.","closed_by":{"login":"cpovirk","id":1703908,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MDM5MDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1703908?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cpovirk","html_url":"https://github.com/cpovirk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cpovirk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cpovirk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cpovirk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cpovirk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cpovirk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cpovirk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cpovirk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cpovirk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cpovirk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google/guava/issues/2755/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google/guava/issues/2755/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
