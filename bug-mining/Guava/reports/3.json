That method should never throw an exception but rather return true or false. The test seems to skip this assertion and I'm surprised this hasn't been reported earlier. \n\nPlease make it so ClassSanityTester#testNulls(Class) doesn't fail when equals is behaving correctly (see the test case where testEquals(MyObject.class succeeds).\n\nOn a side note, the text returned should be adapted as it mentions three times MyObjectTest$MyObject. That's 2 too many, and it renders the whole error message nearly not understandable.\n","closed_by":{"login":"cpovirk","id":1703908,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MDM5MDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1703908?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cpovirk","html_url":"https://github.com/cpovirk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cpovirk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cpovirk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cpovirk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cpovirk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cpovirk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cpovirk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cpovirk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cpovirk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cpovirk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google/guava/issues/1819/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google/guava/issues/1819/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
