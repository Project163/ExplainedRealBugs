a look at [MapPutIfAbsentTester](https://github.com/google/guava/blob/master/guava-testlib/src/com/google/common/collect/testing/testers/MapPutIfAbsentTester.java).

The tests should be run by [OpenJdk6MapTests](https://github.com/google/guava/blob/master/guava-testlib/test/com/google/common/collect/testing/OpenJdk6MapTests.java) which includes JDK maps that support or disallow null values, so verifying that yours works as expected means to see that your new tests intentionally fail and then go green when implemented.

Error Prone.\n\nThis has some effects on us as we develop Guava, but it doesn't affect end users.\n\nSpecifically:\n\n- When we build Guava with JDK8, we now have to disable Error Prone. (Again, users can still use Guava with JDK8, including with Error Prone. The effect is limited to people who are developing Guava.)\n- We can now successfully build Guava with Error Prone under more recent JDKs. That is, this change should fix the error reported in https://github.com/google/guava/issues/6217#issuecomment-1287990845. (I'm not sure if the Error Prone update was necessary for that or if only the other `pom.xml` changes were. Still, it seems inevitable that we'll be forced to upgrade Error Prone eventually, and it's rarely a bad idea to update a plugin.)\n\nThis change is progress toward building and testing under Java 17 (https://github.com/google/guava/issues/5801)...\n\n...which we apparently regressed at when we enabled Error Prone (https://github.com/google/guava/issues/2484).\n\nOddly, it seems that part of our existing Error Prone setup is _required_ to continue building Guava under JDK8. (Such builds are potentially useful for https://github.com/google/guava/issues/3990 or for anyone building Guava manually with an old JDK.) That's the case even though we're now disabling Error Prone for those builds.\n\nAgain, all these changes affect only people who are developing Guava, not end users.\n\nRELNOTES=n/a\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google/guava/issues/6230/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google/guava/issues/6230/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":7684783369,"node_id":"REFE_lADOATXBkc5UEFLxzwAAAAHKDH0J","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google/guava/issues/events/7684783369","actor":{"login":"copybara-service[bot]","id":56741989,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90NTY3NDE5ODk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/44061?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/copybara-service","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/copybara-service%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"c2229a9f71259d0573d8c20e93dc1b9bfb470c0d","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google/guava/commits/c2229a9f71259d0573d8c20e93dc1b9bfb470c0d","created_at":"2022-10-27T18:18:20Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google/guava/issues/comments/1293908815","html_url":"https://github.com/google/guava/issues/6217#issuecomment-1293908815","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google/guava/issues/6217","id":1293908815,"node_id":"IC_kwDOATXBkc5NH3tP","user":{"login":"cpovirk","id":1703908,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MDM5MDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1703908?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cpovirk","html_url":"https://github.com/cpovirk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cpovirk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cpovirk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cpovirk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cpovirk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cpovirk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cpovirk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cpovirk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cpovirk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cpovirk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-10-27T18:27:44Z","updated_at":"2022-10-27T18:27:44Z","body":"Thanks for taking a look at this, and sorry for the build problems.
