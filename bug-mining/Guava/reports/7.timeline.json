Sorry about that. I agree that works for most users, although the limitation also extends to situations where the filters are being deserialized. Being a probabilistic data structure, the approximate count is intrinsic to the object the same way mightContain() is, so this would allow the object to be passed around without having to pair it with a count.","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google/guava/issues/comments/288561872/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"tcbeutler","id":3911368,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5MTEzNjg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3911368?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tcbeutler","html_url":"https://github.com/tcbeutler","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tcbeutler/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tcbeutler/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tcbeutler/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tcbeutler/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tcbeutler/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tcbeutler/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tcbeutler/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tcbeutler/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tcbeutler/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google/guava/issues/comments/289507702","html_url":"https://github.com/google/guava/issues/2755#issuecomment-289507702","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google/guava/issues/2755","id":289507702,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI4OTUwNzcwMg==","user":{"login":"kevinb9n","id":934551,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkzNDU1MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/934551?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinb9n","html_url":"https://github.com/kevinb9n","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinb9n/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinb9n/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinb9n/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinb9n/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinb9n/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinb9n/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinb9n/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinb9n/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinb9n/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-03-27T16:29:06Z","updated_at":"2017-03-27T20:01:20Z","body":"Note that the formula seems to use an approximation: it divides by `-k/m` instead of dividing by `ln(1 - k/m)` (which is what would fall out of solving `X = m - m * (1 - k/m)^n` for `n`).
