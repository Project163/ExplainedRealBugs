approach so far has been not to forward `default` methods (except for the case in which [a method already existed and merely _became_ a `default` method afterward](https://github.com/google/guava/commit/cee9942d5ac735d8d143dad9cee019670f3b8ada#diff-db179e5f5bacd8b115711f86d508e334cad27a9f2ad5c4847776fae0cef1df44R30)).\r\n\r\nIn the case of `ExecutorService.close`, the motivation for not forwarding is that someone might use `ForwardingExecutorService` to implement an `UnshutdownableExecutorService` by overriding `shutdown` and `shutdownNow`. If `ForwardingExecutorService` began to forward `close` calls to the underlying executor, then that would unexpectedly provide a way to shut down the executor.\r\n\r\nThis is definitely a wart, but it's probably our best option, given that `default` methods mess a little bit with our original assumptions about interfaces. (And it's another weird thing about the `Forwarding*` classes in general.)\r\n\r\nFrom your linked PR (thanks!), I gather that you filed this issue at least partially because of a failing test (which maybe could be changed to ignore `default` methods... if not for the exception I mentioned above) but also partially because you're asking whether it's better for forward in this case or not. Let me know if there's other context that I missed from skimming over it.\r\n\r\nIn any case, we should document this behavior, as we did for `ForwardingCollection` and friends way back when.","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google/guava/issues/comments/1385916649/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"cpovirk","id":1703908,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MDM5MDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1703908?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cpovirk","html_url":"https://github.com/cpovirk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cpovirk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cpovirk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cpovirk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cpovirk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cpovirk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cpovirk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cpovirk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cpovirk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cpovirk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":8248927592,"node_id":"LE_lADOATXBkc5bewtXzwAAAAHrrKVo","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google/guava/issues/events/8248927592","actor":{"login":"cpovirk","id":1703908,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MDM5MDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1703908?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cpovirk","html_url":"https://github.com/cpovirk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cpovirk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cpovirk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cpovirk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cpovirk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cpovirk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cpovirk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cpovirk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cpovirk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cpovirk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2023-01-17T19:07:56Z","label":{"name":"type=api-docs","color":"f4d75f"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":8248927595,"node_id":"LE_lADOATXBkc5bewtXzwAAAAHrrKVr","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google/guava/issues/events/8248927595","actor":{"login":"cpovirk","id":1703908,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MDM5MDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1703908?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cpovirk","html_url":"https://github.com/cpovirk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cpovirk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cpovirk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cpovirk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cpovirk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cpovirk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cpovirk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cpovirk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cpovirk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cpovirk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2023-01-17T19:07:56Z","label":{"name":"package=concurrent","color":"62a0e5"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":8248927596,"node_id":"LE_lADOATXBkc5bewtXzwAAAAHrrKVs","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google/guava/issues/events/8248927596","actor":{"login":"cpovirk","id":1703908,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MDM5MDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1703908?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cpovirk","html_url":"https://github.com/cpovirk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cpovirk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cpovirk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cpovirk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cpovirk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cpovirk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cpovirk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cpovirk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cpovirk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cpovirk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2023-01-17T19:07:56Z","label":{"name":"P2","color":"fcd42f"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":8248927762,"node_id":"AE_lADOATXBkc5bewtXzwAAAAHrrKYS","url":"https://api.githu

It's not a generic `Forwarding*` class (where we would have concerns like above), it's a concrete class that just happens to be built on `Forwarding*` class as a foundation.\r\n\r\n\r\n> In any case, we should document this behavior, as we did for `ForwardingCollection` and friends way back when.\r\n\r\nI am sure I have seen this warning there at some point, but forgot about it.\r\nWould it make sense to add some general comment about default methods on the project wiki page?\r\n\r\nFor `ForwardingExecutorService`, please consider taking a look at

we'll get https://github.com/google/guava/pull/6299 merged.\r\n\r\nAs for the wiki, it's mostly been focused on information for end users, rather than for information about the design of Guava. Now, to be fair, the question of how our forwarding classes behave is of interest to end users :) But I think users are significantly more likely to find it in the Javadoc than on the wiki, so I think it falls to us to notice things like this and document them. (I would imagine we could write a test, similar to the one your project has, to notify us of new `default` methods. I'm not sure even that will be a priority unless we start hearing more reports like this, but it would probably be my next step.)\r\n\r\nThat still leaves a further question, which is whether it would be good for us to share more of the internal design notes that we have with the public. It's one of those things that we periodically talk about doing. It might still happen one of these
