thanks for the catch.  This is a bug.  It arose from a bug fix, but @cpovirk is correct that the behavior of `contains()` didn't specifically come up in the review (@cpovirk, the API review which led to this change included \"endpoint ordering mismatches\" in the title if you want to look it up).\r\n\r\n@jbduncan thanks for the analysis; you are correct about the cause.\r\n\r\nThe original review was about fixing undefined behavior for mutations involving the case where someone added an unordered `EndpointPair` to a directed graph (the behavior is undefined, because the assignment of “nodeU” and “nodeV” to the endpoints is arbitrary).\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, I think that I got a bit too cute with the solution (and I don't think any of the reviewers noticed the problem).  Technically adding an ordered edge `<u, v>` to an undirected graph is...not invalid, because the graph can simply ignore the directionality of the endpoints.  Our mistake was that we should not have (implicitly) concluded that you can say that the resultant graph _contains_ a directed edge `<u, v>` if there is an undirected edge connecting `u` and `v`.\r\n\r\nAs @h908714124 pointed out, we should not have defined `contains()` in such a way as to be inconsistent with `equals()` (that's clearly a violation of the `Set` contract as well as being weird) and it is also clear that an unordered `EndpointPair` should never be equal to an ordered `EndpointPair`.  Therefore we need to fix the `contains()` behavior.\r\n\r\n@cpovirk, since you've apparently already identified the failing tests (which implies that you have a CL with this change), I'd be happy to review a fix for this.  Otherwise I'll try to get to it.","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google/guava/issues/comments/1016039798/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"jrtom","id":11969894,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExOTY5ODk0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11969894?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrtom","html_url":"https://github.com/jrtom","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrtom/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrtom/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrtom/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrtom/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrtom/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrtom/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrtom/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrtom/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jrtom/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":5914776130,"node_id":"MEE_lADOATXBkc5AwoRczwAAAAFgjFJC","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google/guava/issues/events/5914776130","actor":{"login":"cpovirk","id":1703908,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MDM5MDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1703908?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cpovirk","html_url":"https://github.com/cpovirk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cpovirk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cpovirk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cpovirk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cpovirk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cpovirk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cpovirk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cpovirk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cpovirk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cpovirk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-01-19T03:16:17Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":5914776134,"node_id":"SE_lADOATXBkc5AwoRczwAAAAFgjFJG","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google/guava/issues/events/5914776134","actor":{"login":"cpovirk","id":1703908,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MDM5MDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1703908?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cpovirk","html_url":"https://github.com/cpovirk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cpovirk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cpovirk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cpovirk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cpovirk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cpovirk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cpovirk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cpovirk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cpovirk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cpovirk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-01-19T03:16:17Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":5914776142,"node_id":"MEE_lADOATXBkc5AwoRczwAAAAFgjFJO","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google/guava/issues/events/5914776142","actor":{"login":"jbduncan","id":2482228,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0ODIyMjg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2482228?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbduncan","html_url":"https://github.com/jbduncan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbduncan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbduncan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbduncan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbduncan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbduncan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbduncan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbduncan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbduncan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbduncan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-01-19T03:16:17Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":5914776146,"node_id":"SE_lADOATXBkc5AwoRczwAAAAFgjFJS","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google/guava/issues/events/5914776146","actor":{"login":"jbduncan","id":2482228,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0ODIyMjg=","avatar_url":"htt
