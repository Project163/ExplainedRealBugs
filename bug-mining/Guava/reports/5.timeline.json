The perlfunc docs list a few:\n\n\"\"\"\nNote that splitting an EXPR that evaluates to the empty string\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;always returns the empty list, regardless of the LIMIT specified.\n\"\"\"\n\nGuava does not follow this precedent, and I think we're right to make that decision.\n\nThere are plenty of other quirks that I'll bypass, such as:\n\n\"\"\"\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A PATTERN of \"/^/\" is treated as if it were \"/^/m\", since it isn't much use otherwise.\n\"\"\"\n\nThen we get to the interesting ones:\n\n\"\"\"\nEmpty leading fields are produced when there are positive-width matches at the beginning of the string; a zero-width match at the beginning of the string does not\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;produce an empty field.\n...\nEmpty trailing fields, on the other hand, are produced when there is a match at the end of the string (and when LIMIT is given\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and is not 0), regardless of the length of the match.\n\"\"\"\n\nWe need to decide what Guava should do with zero-width matches at the beginning and end of string. An additional complication is that String.split does not completely follow Perl's precedent. We can see this from eagle.xiao's example on issue 936. In slightly simplified form:\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;System.out.println(Arrays.toString(\"a\".split(\"(?<=a)|(?=a)\", -1)));\n[, a, ]\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;perl -e 'for (split(/(?<=a)|(?=a)/, \"a\", -1)) { print \"$_\\n\"; }' | sed -e 's/^$/&lt;blank>/'\na\n&lt;blank>\n\nString.split produces a leading empty string; Perl does not.\n\nBut String.split usually avoids leading empty strings:\n\n```\nSystem.out.println(Arrays.toString(\"a\".split(\"(?=a)\", -1)));\n```\n\n[a]\n\n```\nSystem.out.println(Arrays.toString(\"a\".split(\"^\", -1)));\n```\n\n[a]\n\nBoth of these match Perl's behavior:\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;perl -e 'for (split(/(?=a)/, \"a\", -1)) { print \"$_\\n\"; }' | sed -e 's/^$/&lt;blank>/'\na\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;perl -e 'for (split(/^/, \"a\", -1)) { print \"$_\\n\"; }' | sed -e 's/^$/&lt;blank>/'\na\n\nI wonder if there's a principled reason for the policy difference between trailing leading and trailing empty strings or whether it's an accident of historical implementation.\n\nWe'll have to decide one way or the other. If we're lucky, no one cares either way :) As for the rare differences between String.split and Perl, I'm not too concerned with what we do there. String.split doesn't appear to document its behavior for this case clearly, so if anything, I'd call its behavior a bug. But I wouldn't go to great lengths to behave like Perl if the problem lies in Pattern and Matcher themselves and thus affects Splitter. (I assume that it does.)\n\nHere's a bonus difference between Perl and String.split:\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;perl -e 'for (split(/(?<=b)|x/, \"fobxx\", -1)) { print \"$_\\n\"; }' | sed -e 's/^$/&lt;blank>/'\nfob\n&lt;blank>\n&lt;blank>\n&lt;blank>\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;System.out.println(Arrays.toString(\"fobxx\".split(\"(?<=b)|x\", -1)));\n[fob, x, ]\n","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google/guava/issues/comments/61350674/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"gissuebot","id":8091570,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgwOTE1NzA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8091570?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gissuebot","html_url":"https://github.com/gissuebot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gissuebot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gissuebot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gissuebot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gissuebot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gissuebot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gissuebot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gissuebot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gissuebot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gissuebot/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google/guava/issues/comments/61350675","html_url":"https://github.com/google/guava/issues/1190#issuecomment-61350675","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google/guava/issues/1190","id":61350675,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYxMzUwNjc1","user":{"login":"gissuebot","id":8091570,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgwOTE1NzA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8091570?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gissuebot","html_url":"https://github.com/gissuebot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gissuebot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gissuebot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gissuebot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gissuebot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gissuebot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gissuebot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gissuebot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gissuebot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gissuebot/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-11-01T00:59:56Z","updated_at":"2014-11-01T00:59:56Z","body":"_[Original comment](https://code.google.com/p/guava-libraries/issues/detail?id=1190#c6) posted by **cpovirk@google.com** on 2013-01-18 at 09:57 PM_\n\n---\n\nHere's a justification for Perl's \"empty string always returns the empty list\" behavior:\nhttp://grokbase.com/t/perl/perl5-porters/0152aed0vc/docs-on-split#20010503im3myfqpcr36yeb5ixjk5dmkly\n\nMy read on that is that the caller should replace...\n\nnext unless @﻿f;\n\n...with...\n\nnext unless $_;\n\n...at which point the special case is no longer necessary.

Chrome cites the ECMAScript spec, which says to ignore both leading _and_ trailing empty string created by zero-width matches:\n\n\"The value of separator may be an empty String, an empty regular expression, or a regular expression that can match an empty String. In this case, separator does not match the empty substring at the beginning or end of the input String, nor does it match the empty substring at the end of the previous separator match. (For example, if separator is the empty String, the String is split up into individual characters; the length of the result array equals the length of the String, and each substring contains one character.)\"\n\nECMAScript also does the questionable thing in which splitting the empty string returns 0 elements (regardless of the value of |limit|, as far as I can tell), but we can look past that. At least it doesn't have magic trailing-empty behavior for negative |limit| :)\n\nIt's possible that the ECMAScript spec's detailed algorithm could be of help to us in our implementation. Then again, I thought I was already more or less happy with Louis's reimplementation, at least setting aside these weird issues that I don't think are worth worrying about anymore.\n\nhttp://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/5.1/#sec-15.5.4.14\n\nFinally, I thought a bit more about Kevin's comment #﻿9. In one respect, we have four options:\n1. ignore both empty leading and trailing strings created by zero-width matches\n2. preserve both ...\n3. ignore trailing ... but not leading\n4. ignore leading ... but not trailing\n\n(1) is what ECMAScript does. I think I prefer this, too.\n(2) is what nothing does, at least from what I've seen (Perl+Java+ECMAScript).\n(3) is what Perl does, but the inconsistency is difficult to explain. I assume it was more of an accidental choice or a result of implementation convenience.\n(4) is what nothing does, and it's inconsistent.\n\n(1) has a precedent, and it avoids a leading/trailing inconsistency. I say we do that.\n","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google/guava/issues/comments/61350932/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"gissuebot","id":8091570,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgwOTE1NzA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8091570?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gissuebot","html_url":"https://github.com/gissuebot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gissuebot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gissuebot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gissuebot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gissuebot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gissuebot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gissuebot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gissuebot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gissuebot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gissuebot/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google/guava/issues/comments/61350935","html_url":"https://github.com/google/guava/issues/1190#issuecomment-61350935","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google/guava/issues/1190","id":61350935,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYxMzUwOTM1","user":{"login":"gissuebot","id":8091570,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgwOTE1NzA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8091570?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gissuebot","html_url":"https://github.com/gissuebot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gissuebot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gissuebot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gissuebot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gissuebot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gissuebot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gissuebot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gissuebot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gissuebot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gissuebot/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-11-01T01:03:55Z","updated_at":"2014-11-01T01:03:55Z","body":"_[Original comment](https://code.google.com/p/guava-libraries/issues/detail?id=1190#c12) posted by **cpovirk@google.com** on 2013-02-02 at 08:46 PM_\n\n---\n\n(I see an in-JavaScript implementation of String.split (StringSplit) in Chrome's v8 engine.

My specific use case is splitting a string, without dropping the delimiters - for example, splitting on arithmentic operators in a string like abc_(1+2) would return [\"abc\",\"_\",\"(\",\"+\",\")\"].  The canonical (only?) way to achieve this kind of split which preserves all the characters using regex is apparently these zero width matches.\n\nSo there is a real-world use case as cpov wondered about above.  In this case, leading and trailing empty strings are useless (but I'm trimming whitespace and dropping empty strings anyway, so it isn't a huge burden if they appear).\n\nA split of \"\" will always

The example of preserving delimiters is a good reason for preferring (1) or (2) over (3) and (4):\n\n$ perl -e 'for (split(/(?=,)|(?<=,)/, \",a,b,c,\", -1)) { print \"$_\\n\"; }' | sed -e 's/^$/&lt;blank>/'\n,\na\n,\nb\n,\nc\n,\n&lt;blank>\n\nSurely nobody wants that, right? Either they want empties at both ends or empties at neither. (Obviously the example is dumb as I've written it, but imagine that comma is replaced with comma/semicolon/colon/....)\n\nAs you point out, the difference between (1) and (2) goes away in the case of omitting empty strings, so maybe it's no big deal either way. In the absence of other use cases, I kind of like following the ECMAScript precedent, but I wouldn't be shocked if the leading and trailing empties were significant to someone.\n\n> A split of \"\" will always produce [\"\"], even with (1) and zero-width\n> matches, right?\n\nYes. I think the way we would look at it, regardless of the (1)/(2)/(3)/(4) choice, is similar to what Kevin said above: If the separator occurs n times, we produce an output with n+1 items. The difference between the policies would be in whether we consider a separator to ever occur before the first character or after the last.\n\nNow that you mention it, that's a fun question for the other policies. If we allow a zero-width match to create empty strings at the beginning but not the end, then I would say that we would likewise have to return a single string when asked to split \"\" on //, since that match would be occurring both at the beginning and at the end, and matches at the end are forbidden. The same would go for the reverse policy. This ensures the following pattern: If you split \"foo\" on //, you get 4 results. If you split \"fo\" on //, you get 3. \"f\" gives 2, and \"\" gives 1. Now suppose that we permit zero-width matches at both beginning and end. \"foo\" gives 5 results, \"fo\" 4,\" \"f\" 3, and \"\" 2. I guess that that's reasonable, too. By contrast, if we permit zero-width matches at neither beginning nor end, we get \"foo\" 3, \"fo\" 2, \"f\" 1, \"\" 1. That's arguably \"worse,\" but it's more consistent with how normal delimiters work: Splitting \"f,o,o\" on \",\" produces 3 results, \"f,o\" 2, \"f\" 1, and \"\" 1 again. That's maybe too much of an edge case to base a position on, but I'll offer it as support, anyway, since it agrees with the way I'm already leaning

someone submits two `FutureTask` instances and calls `cancel(true)` on the first, that interrupt will propagate from the first task to the second. Perhaps worse, it will propagate _only if_ the second task is submitted before the first is done.\n\nPossibly we should do something about this. If so, the right thing to do might be to check for interruption each iteration. If the thread was interrupted, then exit from the current `QueueWorker.run`, calling `startQueueWorker` to queue up another. In the scenario described above, this will start a new, un-interrupted worker. In the other possible scenario, that of a `shutdownNow` call on the delegate executor, the `execute` call will fail (and hopefully the exception will at least be dumped to standard error). That's probably a defensible thing to do, since it's similar to what would have happened to other un-executed tasks (except that those would be returned from `shutdownNow`... though in practice, I think almost no one looks at those, anyway).\n\nBut... I think there's a good case to be made that submitting a `FutureTask` and calling `cancel(true)` on it is a bogus thing to do: [We shouldn't be interrupting threads that we don't own.](https://github.com/google/guava/issues/1989#issuecomment-199262664) So maybe there's nothing that `SerializingExecutor` needs to do here.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google/guava/issues/2440/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google/guava/issues/2440/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google/guava/issues/comments/255619740","html_url":"https://github.com/google/guava/issues/1190#issuecomment-255619740","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/google/guava/issues/1190","id":255619740,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI1NTYxOTc0MA==","user":{"login":"jbduncan","id":2482228,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0ODIyMjg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2482228?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbduncan","html_url":"https://github.com/jbduncan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbduncan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbduncan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbduncan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbduncan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbduncan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbduncan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbduncan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbduncan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jbduncan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-10-23T22:38:33Z","updated_at":"2016-10-23T22:38:33Z","body":"How is this going along?
