fixes #19\r\n\r\n**Why**:\r\nDevelopers would expect `cypress-testing-library` commands to respect `defaultCommandTimeout` value (this value can be set via `cypress.json`).\r\n\r\n**How**:\r\nWe just replaced the hard-coded `3000` ms with `Cypress.config().defaultCommandTimeout`.\r\n\r\n**Checklist**:\r\n\r\n* [x] Documentation N/A\r\n* [ ] Tests\r\n* [ ] Ready to be merged\r\n* [x] Added myself to contributors table <!-- this is optional, see the contributing guidelines for instructions -->\r\n\r\nAt this point, I'm just not sure what would be the most appropriate way to test this, any advice? Would it be better to test this with cypress or with jest
