is related to testing-library/cypress-testing-library#68, moving typings to `DefinitelyTyped`.\r\n\r\nA couple of questions:\r\n- Is the import of jquery for typings correct in `index.d.ts`? I was thinking I would need to add it to `paths` in `tsconfig.json`, but `npm run test` will fail with `In JQuery, unexpected path mapping for JQuery: 'jquery'`.\r\n- Any suggestions to improve the typings to get rid of unnecessary generics? I've currently disabled the rule in linting, but I see this is located under [common mistakes](https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped/blob/master/README.md#common-mistakes)\r\n\r\nAny other feedback to improve this is appreciated\r\n\r\n---\r\n- [x] Use a meaningful title for the pull request. Include the name of the package modified.\r\n- [x] Test the change in your own code. (Compile and run.)\r\n- [x] Add or edit tests to reflect the change. (Run with `npm test`.)\r\n- [x] Follow the advice from the [readme](https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped/blob/master/README.md#make-a-pull-request).\r\n- [ ] Avoid [common mistakes](https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped/blob/master/README.md#common-mistakes). **See question**\r\n- [x] Run `npm run lint package-name` (or `tsc` if no `tslint.json` is present).\r\n\r\nSelect one of these and delete the others:\r\n\r\nIf adding a new definition:\r\n- [x] The package does not already provide its own types, or cannot have its `.d.ts` files generated via `--declaration`\r\n- [x] If this is for an NPM package, match the name. If not, do not conflict with the name of an NPM package.\r\n- [x] Create it with `dts-gen --dt`, not by basing it on an existing project. **Inspired by other typings for testing-library__\\***\r\n- [x] `tslint.json` should be present, and `tsconfig.json` should have `noImplicitAny`, `noImplicitThis`, `strictNullChecks`, and `strictFunctionTypes` set to `true`.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped/issues/37692/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped/issues/37692/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/testing-library/cypress-testing-library/issues/comments/522179649","html_url":"https://github.com/testing-library/cypress-testing-library/issues/68#issuecomment-522179649","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/testing-library/cypress-testing-library/issues/68","id":522179649,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUyMjE3OTY0OQ==","user":{"login":"simjes","id":6494049,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0OTQwNDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6494049?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/simjes","html_url":"https://github.com/simjes","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/simjes/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/simjes/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/simjes/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/simjes/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/simjes/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/simjes/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/simjes/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/simjes/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/simjes/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-08-16T23:22:32Z","updated_at":"2019-08-16T23:22:47Z","body":"Waiting
