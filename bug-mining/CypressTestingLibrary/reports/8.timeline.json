I wanted those concepts to come to `@testing-library/cypress` as well, but the commands didn't do what I expected. It wasn't even until recently that #100 allowed a previous subject to be used! These commands are just too useful, but just lacked the last mile of finesse. Most of these issues are outlined in #103 \r\n\r\nThis PR closes some of the UX/DX gaps that built-in Cypress commands have.\r\n\r\nMy original intent was to break features up into separate PRs, but the features required changes to the same lines of code and could not be done independently. If it is a big concern, features can be introduced in separate PRs serially due to the interdependency of the same lines of code.\r\n\r\n<!-- What changes are being made? (What feature/bug is being fixed here?) -->\r\n\r\n**What**:\r\n\r\n* Add element selector information for debugging (outlines element when you click on command) (fixes #103)\r\nScreenshot shows the element outline highlighted in the application view. Also showing which element is yielded, like other Cypress commands that return elements.\r\n![Screen Shot 2020-01-30 at 11 04 52 AM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/338257/73476868-5f16dd00-4350-11ea-962f-fa4e65121580.png)\r\n\r\n* Add @testing-library/dom errors (from `get*` queries) to failure messages - these are more helpful than the generic `find*('input') does not exist` messages (fixes #103)\r\n![Screen Shot 2020-01-30 at 11 22 41 AM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/338257/73478188-dc435180-4352-11ea-822b-fa95cfac62f4.png)\r\n\r\n* Add retryability to `findBy*` when multiple elements are found (fixes #83)\r\n![Screen Shot 2020-01-30 at 11 23 28 AM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/338257/73478233-f5e49900-4352-11ea-9661-79930de55e16.png)\r\n\r\n* Add option to disable logging of all commands\r\n* `query*` and `find*` have a consistent code path and error messaging (fixes #103)\r\n* Remove usage of Cypress commands in queries (fixes #103)\r\n* Add ability to use a previous subject in a more idiomatic way without introducing breaking changes caused by #100 (fixes #109 and #110)\r\n* Add parent/child log type detection for more accurate Cypress command logging (\"Parent\" aligns left while \"child\" is indented and preceded by a `-` like in the screenshot)\r\n<img width=\"574\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2020-01-30 at 10 33 01 PM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/338257/73515254-e34d7c80-43b1-11ea-9b0f-6cfcaecad8ef.png\">\r\n\r\n\r\n**How**:\r\n\r\nI tried to make test cases for all changes. They should all fail without these changes. I'm happy to add more if I've missed any. I've tested changes against a local branch of https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit using `@testing-library/cypress` and things are working.\r\n\r\n**Breaking Changes?**:\r\n\r\n`query*` will now fail if no element was found. Before the command would pass an empty object which could cause the next command to fail (e.g. `.click()`). If a `query*` failed to return an element, a `.should('exist')` would not fail because the assertion was given a non-null value. With this change the test should pass/fail as expected, but not as previously implemented.\r\n\r\n<!-- Have you done all of these things?  -->\r\n\r\n**Checklist**:\r\n\r\n<!-- add \"N/A\" to the end of each line that's irrelevant to your changes -->\r\n\r\n<!-- to check an item, place an \"x\" in the box like so: \"- [x] Documentation\" -->\r\n\r\n- [x] Documentation\r\n- [x] Tests\r\n- [x] Ready to be merged\r\n      <!-- In your opinion, is this ready to be merged as soon as it's reviewed? -->\r\n\r\n<!-- feel free to add additional comments -->\r\nI don't expect this PR to be merged right away and I expect some conversation.\r\n\r\nSome open questions:\r\n- [x] Should `get*` queries be allowed instead of throwing errors? This library is now using `@testing-library/dom` `get*` APIs for error messages. If that's the case, `get*`, `query*`, and `find*` all would use the same underlying implementation.\r\n- [x] Does the difference between `*By*` and `*AllBy*` make sense in the context of Cypress? Cypress DOM APIs return a jQuery NodeList with one or more elements. Most of the time this is completely fine and expected, but certain commands expect only one element. For example, `.click` will throw an error if handed multiple elements. `.first()` can easily be used to return only the first one or the previous query can be updated to return only one. If a user expects a certain number (including only one), the command can be followed by `.should('have.length', 1)` if the test is meant to ensure only a single element exists in the DOM and fail otherwise - so single vs multiple is opt-in for other elements.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/testing-library/cypress-testing-library/issues/108/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/testing-library/cypress-testing-library/issues/108/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":3006726665,"node_id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDMwMDY3MjY2NjU=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/testing-library/cypress-testing-library/issues/events/3006726665","actor":{"login":"kentcdodds","id":1500684,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MDA2ODQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1500684?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kentcdodds","html_url":"https://github.com/kentcdodds","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kentcdodds/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kentcdodds/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kentcdodds/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kentcdodds/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kentcdodds/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kentcdodds/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kentcdodds/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kentcdodds/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kentcdodds/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-02-04T16:11:44Z","label":{"name":"bug","color":"d73a4a"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/testing-library/cypress-testing-library/issues/comments/581993452","html_url":"https://github.com/testing-library/cypress-testing-library/issues/117#issuecomment-581993452","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/testing-library/cypress-testing-library/issues/117","id":581993452,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU4MTk5MzQ1Mg==","user":{"login":"NicholasBoll","id":338257,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzODI1Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/338257?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/NicholasBoll","html_url":"https://github.com/NicholasBoll","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NicholasBoll/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NicholasBoll/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NicholasBoll/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NicholasBoll/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NicholasBoll/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NicholasBoll/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NicholasBoll/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NicholasBoll/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NicholasBoll/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-02-04T16:26:58Z","updated_at":"2020-02-04T16:26:58Z","body":"I don't mind taking this on since I broke it.

Could you update #117 with some reproduction steps? I've been trying to reproduce the problem and haven't been able to. I'm positive I was able to reproduce before, but I must be missing something. I've tried the following with many versions of this library:\r\n\r\n```js\r\n    cy.queryByText('Eventually not exists').then($el => {\r\n      cy.wrap($el).should('not.exist')\r\n    })\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe button with \"Eventually not exists\" is in the `index.html` of this document and gets removed by a timer after 500ms. I've also tried with your custom command: `retryUntilDoesNotExist()`.\r\n\r\nAccording to the [list of releases](https://github.com/testing-library/cypress-testing-library/releases):\r\n- 5.1.0: #100 adding support for previous subjects\r\n- 5.1.1: #106 removing an extra log in `get*` queries since forcibly failing results in a log\r\n- 5.1.2: reverted #100 \r\n- 5.2.0: #108 add more useful debugging and polish. Closes a bunch of previous issues. Includes a fallback on previous functionality before #100 (allowing previous subject queries, falling back to no previous subject for code relying on the functionality that all queries start from `document`)\r\n- 5.2.1: #115 removes previous subject requirement used in #100 and #108. This prevents Cypress from throwing errors if the subject returned from a previous chain wasn't a `document`, `window` or `element` type. This was preventing the fallback from working in certain cases\r\n\r\nYou mentioned you bumped from 5.1.1 to 5.2.0.\r\n\r\nFrom what I can tell there are 3 differences between #100 and #108 (main differences between 5.1.1 and 5.2.0):\r\n- `query*` queries that fail `@testing-library/dom` get errors attached and fail vs returning `{}` when an element is not found (caused `.click()` to throw \"needs an element\" error vs `query*` erroring)\r\n- `query*` runs `verifyUpcomingAssertions` rather than just returning a value (normalizes logic flow between `query*` and `find*`)\r\n- #108 runs a fallback for pre-#100 behavior\r\n\r\nFrom what your issue was, I'm guessing the 2nd is causing your issue. If the 3rd was causing issues, using `find*` + `.should('not.exist')` would also fail. I'm not sure how the first could cause an issue. Technically #100 uses `query*` queries from `@testing-library/dom` and #108 uses `get*` queries from `@testing-library/dom` to get errors. Perhaps there is a subtle difference there? `get*` queries are used to get more useful error messages and run a retry loop until an error is no longer thrown (eventually finds the element)\r\n\r\nI guess there is another subtle difference. #108 allows timeout overrides for retry loops where #100 did not. Perhaps there's a issue there?\r\n\r\nIt would really help to narrow down what previous functionality is required. I could simply revert any changes to the `query*` queries, but I'm not sure what tests to run so the original functionality isn't changed again.","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/testing-library/cypress-testing-library/issues/comments/582114096/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"NicholasBoll","id":338257,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzODI1Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/338257?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/NicholasBoll","html_url":"https://github.com/NicholasBoll","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NicholasBoll/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NicholasBoll/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NicholasBoll/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NicholasBoll/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NicholasBoll/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NicholasBoll/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NicholasBoll/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NicholasBoll/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NicholasBoll/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":3007697385,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MzAwNzY5NzM4NQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/testing-library/cypress-testing-library/issues/events/3007697385","actor":{"login":"andycarrell","id":22784983,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNzg0OTgz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22784983?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/andycarrell","html_url":"https://github.com/andycarrell","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andycarrell/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andycarrell/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andycarrell/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andycarrell/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andycarrell/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andycarrell/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andycarrell/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andycarrell/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andycarrell/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-02-04T21:04:14Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3007697389,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDMwMDc2OTczODk=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/testing-library/cypress-testing-library/issues/events/3007697389","actor":{"login":"andycarrell","id":22784983,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNzg0OTgz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22784983?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/andycarrell","html_url":"https://github.com/andycarrell","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andycarrell/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andycarrell/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andycarrell/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andycarrell/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andycarrell/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andycarrell/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andycarrell/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andycarrell/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andycarrell/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-02-04T21:04:15Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/testing-library/cypress-testing-library/issues/comments/582158396","html_url":"https://github.com/testing-library/cypress-testing-library/issues/117#issuecomment-582158396","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/testing-library/cypress-testing-library/issues/117","id":582158396,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU4MjE1ODM5Ng==","user":{"login":"andycarrell","id":22784983,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNzg0OTgz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22784983?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/andycarrell","html_url":"https://github.com/andycarrell","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andycarrell/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andycarrell/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andycarrell/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andycarrell/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andycarrell/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andycarrell/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andycarrell/repos","events_url":"htt

const text = 'Supercalifragilistic'\r\n\r\n    cy.queryByText('Eventually not exists').then($el => {\r\n      cy.wrap($el).should('not.exist')\r\n    })\r\n    cy.queryByText(`Currently does not exist - ${text}`).then($el => {\r\n      cy.wrap($el).should('not.exist')\r\n    })\r\n  })\r\n```\r\n\r\nAdditionally, I'm not even sure if it's worth reverting this change, if it just going to be slated for the next major version - I'm not even sure of the wider impact currently, and reverting it would just delay the pain to the next major version update.\r\n I think the case presented is a legitimate and useful case for `queryBy*` still returning `null` and it's a bit punishing that the original change (v5.2) removes this

know why this is happening now. I changed `query*` to use `verifyUpcomingAssertions` which will put an implicit `should('exist')` after the command. That works if you follow the command with an assertion - the explicit assertion changes the implicit one. If you disconnect the chain with a `.then` and a `.wrap`, the implicit assertion is in place and it doesn't get to the `.wrap`. That's true for built-in Cypress commands as well.\r\n\r\n```js\r\n // always worked\r\ncy.queryByText('Never Exists').should('not.exist')\r\n\r\n// Broke on the `queryByText` command since using `verifyUpcomingAssertions`\r\ncy.queryByText('Never Exists').then(val => {\r\n  cy.wrap(val).should('not.exist')\r\n})\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe reason the `wrap` worked before is because `query ` used to return `null` and not fail like other commands that return DOM. This functionality might have been intentional since `find*` commands didn't always retry properly. (I think that happened in 5.0).\r\n\r\nI'm very sorry for the inconvenience. I'm glad the Cypress Testing Library `find*` commands work more like native Cypress commands. It makes it more natural to use in the Cypress context.\r\n\r\nI'll leave this issue open a bit more. Perhaps it is still safer to revert the `query*` line of queries. There's a higher chance the upgrade breaks people that haven't updated yet. Your code should be fine.
