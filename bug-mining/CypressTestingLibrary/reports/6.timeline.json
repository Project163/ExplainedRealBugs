`Cypress.log`. Logs usually need an `.end()` to tell Cypress when the log is closed since Cypress commands are asynchronous.

This is somewhat enforced in the code here by only allowing the `find` types to retry and not letting the `query` types retry. Does this make sense? All normal Cypress commands always retry. One of the stated usefulness of `query` resolving synchronously in the docs is to verify non-existence, but Cypress allows testing existence through `.should('exist')` and non-existence through `.should('not.exist')`.\r\n\r\nDoes it make still make sense to not retry `query*` matchers? `cy.find*` already doesn't match the documentation because it can be modified by `.should('not.exist')`.\r\n\r\nI'm debating removing the restriction to not retry `cy.query*`, but then the functionality is exactly the same as

thanks! I agree. In order to have more useful errors, I changed the logic a bit to follow the same codepath as find queries, but with a 1ms duration. This keeps the messages consistent.\r\n\r\nAs I was thinking about my original issue with the more complex `find[All]ByLabelText`, I realized the `get*` query types already have more descriptive error messages. I'll try switching both `query*` and `find*` queries to use `get*` under the hood. Adding a retry-on-error loop will ensure the same retry as before, but with more descriptive error messages straight from `@tesing-library/dom`\r\n\r\nWe can see if that seems like the way to

I wanted those concepts to come to `@testing-library/cypress` as well, but the commands didn't do what I expected. It wasn't even until recently that #100 allowed a previous subject to be used! These commands are just too useful, but just lacked the last mile of finesse. Most of these issues are outlined in #103 \r\n\r\nThis PR closes some of the UX/DX gaps that built-in Cypress commands have.\r\n\r\nMy original intent was to break features up into separate PRs, but the features required changes to the same lines of code and could not be done independently. If it is a big concern, features can be introduced in separate PRs serially due to the interdependency of the same lines of code.\r\n\r\n<!-- What changes are being made? (What feature/bug is being fixed here?) -->\r\n\r\n**What**:\r\n\r\n* Add element selector information for debugging (outlines element when you click on command) (fixes #103)\r\nScreenshot shows the element outline highlighted in the application view. Also showing which element is yielded, like other Cypress commands that return elements.\r\n![Screen Shot 2020-01-30 at 11 04 52 AM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/338257/73476868-5f16dd00-4350-11ea-962f-fa4e65121580.png)\r\n\r\n* Add @testing-library/dom errors (from `get*` queries) to failure messages - these are more helpful than the generic `find*('input') does not exist` messages (fixes #103)\r\n![Screen Shot 2020-01-30 at 11 22 41 AM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/338257/73478188-dc435180-4352-11ea-822b-fa95cfac62f4.png)\r\n\r\n* Add retryability to `findBy*` when multiple elements are found (fixes #83)\r\n![Screen Shot 2020-01-30 at 11 23 28 AM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/338257/73478233-f5e49900-4352-11ea-9661-79930de55e16.png)\r\n\r\n* Add option to disable logging of all commands\r\n* `query*` and `find*` have a consistent code path and error messaging (fixes #103)\r\n* Remove usage of Cypress commands in queries (fixes #103)\r\n* Add ability to use a previous subject in a more idiomatic way without introducing breaking changes caused by #100 (fixes #109 and #110)\r\n* Add parent/child log type detection for more accurate Cypress command logging (\"Parent\" aligns left while \"child\" is indented and preceded by a `-` like in the screenshot)\r\n<img width=\"574\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2020-01-30 at 10 33 01 PM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/338257/73515254-e34d7c80-43b1-11ea-9b0f-6cfcaecad8ef.png\">\r\n\r\n\r\n**How**:\r\n\r\nI tried to make test cases for all changes. They should all fail without these changes. I'm happy to add more if I've missed any. I've tested changes against a local branch of https://github.com/Workday/canvas-kit using `@testing-library/cypress` and things are working.\r\n\r\n**Breaking Changes?**:\r\n\r\n`query*` will now fail if no element was found. Before the command would pass an empty object which could cause the next command to fail (e.g. `.click()`). If a `query*` failed to return an element, a `.should('exist')` would not fail because the assertion was given a non-null value. With this change the test should pass/fail as expected, but not as previously implemented.\r\n\r\n<!-- Have you done all of these things?  -->\r\n\r\n**Checklist**:\r\n\r\n<!-- add \"N/A\" to the end of each line that's irrelevant to your changes -->\r\n\r\n<!-- to check an item, place an \"x\" in the box like so: \"- [x] Documentation\" -->\r\n\r\n- [x] Documentation\r\n- [x] Tests\r\n- [x] Ready to be merged\r\n      <!-- In your opinion, is this ready to be merged as soon as it's reviewed? -->\r\n\r\n<!-- feel free to add additional comments -->\r\nI don't expect this PR to be merged right away and I expect some conversation.\r\n\r\nSome open questions:\r\n- [x] Should `get*` queries be allowed instead of throwing errors? This library is now using `@testing-library/dom` `get*` APIs for error messages. If that's the case, `get*`, `query*`, and `find*` all would use the same underlying implementation.\r\n- [x] Does the difference between `*By*` and `*AllBy*` make sense in the context of Cypress? Cypress DOM APIs return a jQuery NodeList with one or more elements. Most of the time this is completely fine and expected, but certain commands expect only one element. For example, `.click` will throw an error if handed multiple elements. `.first()` can easily be used to return only the first one or the previous query can be updated to return only one. If a user expects a certain number (including only one), the command can be followed by `.should('have.length', 1)` if the test is meant to ensure only a single element exists in the DOM and fail otherwise - so single vs multiple is opt-in for other
