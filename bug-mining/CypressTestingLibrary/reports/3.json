After a few selects, I figured it would be just easier to set the default command timeout in `cypress.json`, so I don't have to set this every time I call `getBy...` methods. So I went to `cypress.json` and put ` \"defaultCommandTimeout\": 6000`.\r\n\r\nWhat happened:\r\nThe default 6000ms command timeout wasn't applied.\r\n\r\nSuggested solution:\r\nI guess we should modify the `defaults` object (https://github.com/kentcdodds/cypress-testing-library/blob/master/src/index.js#L5):\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nvar defaults = {\r\n  timeout: Cypress.config().defaultCommandTimeout\r\n};\r\n```","closed_by":{"login":"kentcdodds","id":1500684,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MDA2ODQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1500684?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kentcdodds","html_url":"https://github.com/kentcdodds","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kentcdodds/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kentcdodds/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kentcdodds/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kentcdodds/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kentcdodds/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kentcdodds/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kentcdodds/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kentcdodds/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kentcdodds/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/testing-library/cypress-testing-library/issues/19/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/testing-library/cypress-testing-library/issues/19/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
