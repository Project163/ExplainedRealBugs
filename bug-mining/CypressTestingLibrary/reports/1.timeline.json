wrapper functions around dom-testing-library which are not the functions exported from dom-testing-library.

way.","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/testing-library/cypress-testing-library/issues/comments/420707957/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"aaronmcadam","id":37928,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3OTI4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/37928?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmcadam","html_url":"https://github.com/aaronmcadam","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmcadam/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmcadam/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmcadam/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmcadam/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmcadam/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmcadam/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmcadam/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmcadam/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmcadam/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":1841588678,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MTg0MTU4ODY3OA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/testing-library/cypress-testing-library/issues/events/1841588678","actor":{"login":"sompylasar","id":498274,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5ODI3NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/498274?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sompylasar","html_url":"https://github.com/sompylasar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sompylasar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sompylasar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sompylasar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sompylasar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sompylasar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sompylasar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sompylasar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sompylasar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sompylasar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-09-12T16:14:29Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":1841588679,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDE4NDE1ODg2Nzk=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/testing-library/cypress-testing-library/issues/events/1841588679","actor":{"login":"sompylasar","id":498274,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5ODI3NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/498274?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sompylasar","html_url":"https://github.com/sompylasar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sompylasar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sompylasar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sompylasar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sompylasar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sompylasar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sompylasar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sompylasar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sompylasar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sompylasar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-09-12T16:14:29Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/testing-library/cypress-testing-library/issues/comments/420760356","html_url":"https://github.com/testing-library/cypress-testing-library/issues/12#issuecomment-420760356","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/testing-library/cypress-testing-library/issues/12","id":420760356,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQyMDc2MDM1Ng==","user":{"login":"sompylasar","id":498274,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5ODI3NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/498274?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sompylasar","html_url":"https://github.com/sompylasar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sompylasar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sompylasar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sompylasar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sompylasar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sompylasar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sompylasar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sompylasar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sompylasar/events{/privacy}","received_ev

Reviewed, thanks.\r\n\r\n> I'm a bit unsure on how best to implement this in a maintainable way.\r\n\r\nYes I'm not sure either. The functions from dom-testing-library are mapped dynamically into cypress commands (function wrappers) in cypress-testing-library by looping over the queries object, but they need static typing. Unless there's a way to statically map types of dom-testing-library functions into types of cypress-testing-library custom command functions, the list of functions will have to be maintained and kept in sync manually.","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/testing-library/cypress-testing-library/issues/comments/420760356/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"sompylasar","id":498274,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5ODI3NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/498274?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sompylasar","html_url":"https://github.com/sompylasar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sompylasar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sompylasar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sompylasar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sompylasar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sompylasar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sompylasar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sompylasar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sompylasar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sompylasar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":1841940741,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MTg0MTk0MDc0MQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/testing-library/cypress-testing-library/issues/events/1841940741","actor":{"login":"aaronmcadam","id":37928,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3OTI4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/37928?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmcadam","html_url":"https://github.com/aaronmcadam","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmcadam/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmcadam/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmcadam/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmcadam/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmcadam/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmcadam/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmcadam/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmcadam/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmcadam/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-09-12T18:58:10Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":1841940742,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDE4NDE5NDA3NDI=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/testing-library/cypress-testing-library/issues/events/1841940742","actor":{"login":"aaronmcadam","id":37928,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3OTI4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/37928?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmcadam","html_url":"https://github.com/aaronmcadam","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmcadam/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmcadam/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmcadam/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmcadam/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmcadam/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmcadam/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmcadam/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmcadam/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmcadam/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-09-12T18:58:10Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":1842519991,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MTg0MjUxOTk5MQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/testing-library/cypress-testing-library/issues/events/1842519991","actor":{"login":"sompylasar","id":498274,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5ODI3NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/498274?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sompylasar","html_url":"https://github.com/sompylasar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sompylasar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sompylasar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sompylasar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sompylasar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sompylasar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sompylasar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sompylasar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sompylasar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sompylasar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null
