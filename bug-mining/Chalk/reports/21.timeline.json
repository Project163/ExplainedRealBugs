the old templating code wasn't really build for how we are utilizing template literals today. A lot of the bugs we faced were the result of unforeseen/unspec'd requirements that were imposed upon the existing code.\r\n\r\nI took a somewhat different approach - a manual parser is all fine and good, but it's tricky to maintain, especially when lots of things pop up and once or when the scope/intent of the code changes drastically (as can be seen by the bug tracker :taco:).\r\n\r\nIt's served us well thus far but I felt it was time to give it a little bit of a ✨ makeover ✨.\r\n\r\nAs a result, it fixes a bunch of bugs and introduces the ability to add custom theme values to your chalk instance and use them in templates (#186).\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nconst chalk = require('chalk');\r\n\r\nconst theme = chalk.constructor();\r\ntheme.rose = theme.hex('#F69D9D');\r\n\r\nconsole.log(theme`Here is some {rose rosy text!}`);\r\n```\r\n\r\nI feel like I'll need to justify using regular expressions here instead of manual parsing:\r\n\r\n1. They're being (ab)used mainly as tokenizers\r\n2. The longest one is just a series of smol patterns or'd together\r\n3. It greatly simplifies the codebase and keeps maintenance costs low (you can drop them into regex101.com and make changes as necessary)\r\n\r\nBy using templates, you're already [incurring quite a bit of overhead](https://stackoverflow.com/a/29083467/510036) in tight loops, so the template literal parsing code is going to be of negligible overhead.\r\n\r\nDon't be fooled by the diff of `templates.js` - it's a complete rewrite. Don't waste your time trying to parse the diff 😅  Not sure why Git isn't better at detecting rewrites.\r\n\r\nCloses #186\r\nFixes #184 \r\nFixes #187 \r\nFixes #176 \r\nFixes #175 \r\nFixes #177 \r\nFixes #194\r\n\r\ncc @vadimdemedes\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nNote to merger: It's probably best _not_ to squash this particular PR. I took a bit of time to rebase it prior to PRing in order to have a nice and clean fast-forward/rebase. cc
