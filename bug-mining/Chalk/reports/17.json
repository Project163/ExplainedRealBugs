A large portion of our tickets (and things I see on StackOverflow) are people misunderstanding how to use chalk. I think they expect `chalk.red(\"hello\")` to output something.\n\nThe readme states `Here without console.log for purity.` which a lot of people miss (even though there's a usage block _right above it_). It might be worthwhile to just include `console.log` (or even `var log = console.log; log(...)`) in there to illustrate that chalk only returns strings with escape sequences, nothing more.\n\nJust a thought.\n","closed_by":{"login":"sindresorhus","id":170270,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MDI3MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/170270?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sindresorhus","html_url":"https://github.com/sindresorhus","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sindresorhus/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sindresorhus/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sindresorhus/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sindresorhus/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sindresorhus/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sindresorhus/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sindresorhus/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sindresorhus/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sindresorhus/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/chalk/chalk/issues/128/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/chalk/chalk/issues/128/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
