Each getter needs to return a new object (a function), and that function needs to have all the getters set. `Object.defineProperty` is brutal in a loop. Here's the options I see:\n1. Live with the performance hit of defining getters on each function. It's not bad at all if you cache the style into a variable, such `var style = chalk.blue.bgRed.bold`, since subsequent uses of `style` won't be triggering new `defineProperty`s. I've added a benchmark that shows with the style cached into a variable.\n2. Get ~8x performance of option 1, by setting `__proto__` on the function to an object with the properties already defined. `__proto__` is deprecated, in ES6 it will become `Object.setPrototypeOf`, but it can't be remove any time soon if they don't want to blow up the web. The docs for `__proto__` state that it hurts performance, but comparing the benchmark with using `Object.create()` and `chalk.red._('foo')` showed it was actually slightly slower than this `__proto__` hack.\n3. Say to hell it with Sean, just call everything off `chalk` (this is still much slower than caching a couple styles).\n\n# \n\nHere's the benches with option 2 (and an optimization of not doing `[].slice.call(arguments)`:\n\n```\nbefore\n                      chalk\n       1,286,288 op/s » single style\n         943,220 op/s » several styles\n         245,858 op/s » nested styles\n\nafter\n

I could also only think of 'either drop the caching or wrap the function with the state on each get', but the way you implemented it seems like a lot cleverer solution to the latter than I would have taken :wink: \n\nRegarding the performance hit: this seems completely acceptable to me, as the huge speed increase between `0.4.0` and `0.5.0` still leaves us with a large net gain.

How much? If it's negligible I would prefer the blessed way.\n\nWell, the problem is it would require changing the API. To use the prototype, we'd need to use `Object.create()`, which doesn't return a function. With this, I attached a function onto the new object at `_`, so it was `chalk.red._('foo')`. This way is actually faster than the `__proto__` hack:\n\n```\n                      chalk\n       3,100,288 op/s » single style\n         333,368 op/s » several styles\n       1,899,971 op/s » cached styles\n         439,495 op/s » nested styles\n```\n\nHowever, if you try to cache a style, and cache the `_` function, it won't be bound to the object anymore. So, to make sure it's bound, it'd basically require something like `builder._ = applyStyle.bind(builder);`, which slows things back down.\n\nPlus, this breaks the API, which I imagined is a non-starter.\n","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/chalk/chalk/issues/comments/48509232/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"seanmonstar","id":51479,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxNDc5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/51479?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar","html_url":"https://github.com/seanmonstar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":139832996,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDEzOTgzMjk5Ng==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/chalk/chalk/issues/events/139832996","actor":{"login":"seanmonstar","id":51479,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxNDc5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/51479?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar","html_url":"https://github.com/seanmonstar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seanmonstar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"42918337e5503c1ec358f485dcd2cc295214b5f9","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/seanmonstar/chalk/commits/42918337e5503c1ec358f485dcd2cc295214b5f9","created_at":"2014-07-09T17:56:50Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/chalk/chalk/issues/comments/48523664","html_url":"https://github.com/chalk/chalk/issues/32#issuecomment-48523664","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/chalk/chalk/issues/32","id":48523664,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ4NTIzNjY0","user":{"login":"sindresorhus","id":170270,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MDI3MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/170270?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sindresorhus","html_url":"https://github.com/sindresorhus","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sindresorhus/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sindresorhus/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sindresorhus/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sindresorhus/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sindresorhus/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sindresorhus/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sindresorhus/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sindresorhus/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sindresorhus/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-07-09T19:36:55Z","updated_at":"2014-07-09T19:36:55Z","body":"Alright,
