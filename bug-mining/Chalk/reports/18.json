Multi-line template literals (or anything similar in other languages) always seem like a cool idea until you have code like this...\r\n\r\n```js\r\nfunction run() {\r\n\tif (something) {\r\n\t\tif (somethingElse) {\r\n\t\t\tconsole.log(`this is the first line\r\n\t\t\tthis is the second`);\r\n\t\t}\r\n\t}\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n...producing the output...\r\n\r\n```\r\nthis is the first line\r\n\t\t\tthis is the second\r\n```\r\n\r\n...which isn't optimal. You could pull the second line all the way to the margin, but that'd never fly with formatters or linters.\r\n\r\nMaybe there's a better way for chalk to detect character escapes (certain character escapes) and not eat them?\r\n\r\nAs a workaround, it is possible to do something like this, though it's not very attractive:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nconsole.log(chalk`{red NO} but...${'\\n'}really, {green YES}`);\r\n```","closed_by":{"login":"Qix-","id":885648,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4NTY0OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/885648?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Qix-","html_url":"https://github.com/Qix-","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Qix-/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Qix-/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Qix-/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Qix-/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Qix-/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Qix-/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Qix-/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Qix-/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Qix-/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/chalk/chalk/issues/177/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/chalk/chalk/issues/177/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
