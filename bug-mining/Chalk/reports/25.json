I use almost only the `chalk.hex()` method and I got this issue:\r\n\r\n```\r\nmyapptest/node_modules/cozy-scripts/node_modules/chalk/index.js:82\r\n\t\t\t\tconst open = ansiStyles.color[levelMapping[level]][model].apply(null, arguments);\r\n\t\t\t\t                                                  ^\r\n\r\nTypeError: Cannot read property 'hex' of undefined\r\n    at Function.<anonymous> (myapptest/node_modules/cozy-scripts/node_modules/chalk/index.js:82:55)\r\n    at Object.<anonymous> (myapptest/node_modules/cozy-scripts/utils/_colorize.js:7:15)\r\n    at Module._compile (module.js:643:30)\r\n    at Object.Module._extensions..js (module.js:654:10)\r\n    at Module.load (module.js:556:32)\r\n    at tryModuleLoad (module.js:499:12)\r\n    at Function.Module._load (module.js:491:3)\r\n    at Module.require (module.js:587:17)\r\n    at require (internal/module.js:11:18)\r\n```\r\n\r\nAll work well with the version 2.2.2 but also if I only use default colors (`chalk.blue()`, `chalk.bgWhite()`). And it seems to concern only my webpack usage like [here](https://github.com/CPatchane/create-cozy-app/blob/master/packages/cozy-scripts/config/webpack.config.progress.js#L16) or [here](https://github.com/CPatchane/create-cozy-app/blob/master/packages/cozy-scripts/scripts/watch.js#L20).\r\nI suppose that came from this commit so: https://github.com/chalk/chalk/commit/7be154c074026f77b99e7d854b3a4cdd5e4ae502\r\n\r\nHope that will help.","closed_by":{"login":"sindresorhus","id":170270,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MDI3MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/170270?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sindresorhus","html_url":"https://github.com/sindresorhus","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sindresorhus/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sindresorhus/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sindresorhus/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sindresorhus/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sindresorhus/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sindresorhus/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sindresorhus/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sindresorhus/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sindresorhus/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/chalk/chalk/issues/248/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/chalk/chalk/issues/248/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
