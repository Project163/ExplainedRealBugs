\"ansi16m\", respectively 0,1,2 and 3. \r\n`level` contains the number representing current terminal's color level.\r\n`model` contains the function name of the used color model.\r\n`ansiStyles.color` contains all the named foreground and background colors \"constants\" (i.e. they contain start and end closure declarations), as well as groups called \"ansi\", \"ansi256\" and \"ansi16m\".\r\nOccurred that, in \"256 colors\" mode, there is no function called ansi256, whereas both \"ansi16m\" and \"ansi\" does have it. And, as it is dynamically defined by current level, there is no checking of existence of object `ansiStyles.color[levelMapping[level]][model]` on line 82.\r\n\r\nSo, why 256 color mode lacks `ansi256` function? \r\nAnd the calling to `.apply` there is not safe.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/chalk/chalk/issues/224/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/chalk/chalk/issues/224/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/chalk/chalk/issues/comments/363574595","html_url":"https://github.com/chalk/chalk/issues/248#issuecomment-363574595","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/chalk/chalk/issues/248","id":363574595,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM2MzU3NDU5NQ==","user":{"login":"danfuzz","id":1090235,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwOTAyMzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1090235?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/danfuzz","html_url":"https://github.com/danfuzz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danfuzz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danfuzz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danfuzz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danfuzz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danfuzz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danfuzz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danfuzz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danfuzz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danfuzz/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-02-06T21:43:34Z","updated_at":"2018-02-06T21:43:34Z","body":"Thanks to @partheseas's work mentioned in #224, I was able to distill out an even better demonstration.
