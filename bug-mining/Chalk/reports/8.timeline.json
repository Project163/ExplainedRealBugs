closes #73.\r\n\r\nReferences #20, #35, #37, #57, #87, #126. We know some of you have been waiting for this one for a very long time.\r\n\r\nThis PR is blocked by a few remaining issues over at [`supports-color`](https://github.com/chalk/supports-color). @sindresorhus has promised me he will take a look at those and make some executive decisions within the coming week. After they are resolved, its version will be bumped in this PR and, pending approval from the community, this will be merged and released.\r\n\r\nThis is an additive release - however, please see the breaking changes section below for a reason why it's a major release.\r\n\r\nThis adds two new suites of chalk-able modes:\r\n\r\n1. Foreground RGB colors using [`color-convert`](https://github.com/qix-/color-convert) models as names (e.g. `chalk.rgb(123, 45, 67)` or `chalk.keyword('orange')`)\r\n2. Background RGB colors, similar to the foreground colors above but with a camel-cased `bg` prefix, (e.g. `chalk.bgRgb(123, 45, 67)` or `chalk.bgKeyword('orange')`)\r\n\r\nAll RGB color functions in turn return your usual chalk builder. Some examples:\r\n\r\n- `chalk.hex('#DEADED').underline('Hello, world!')`\r\n- `chalk.keyword('orange')('Some orange text')`\r\n- `chalk.rgb(15, 100, 204).inverse('Hello!')`\r\n\r\nThis is per [@silverwind's suggestion](https://github.com/chalk/chalk/issues/73#issuecomment-124826052) in #73, which we agreed is the most intuitive way to approach this API.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n**This module now requires Node.js 4 or above**. This is why it is a major release bump.\r\n\r\nThe only potentially API-related breaking changes is if you use Chalk's `.enabled` property, you'll need to replace it with `.level`, which is now an integer (where `0` indicates not enabled and anything >= 1 indicates enabled, and further, one of several levels of color granularity).\r\n\r\nAs well, if you're passing an option to chalk to forcefully set whether or not it's enabled, you'll need to change:\r\n\r\n- `{enabled: false}` -> `{level: 0}`, or\r\n- `{enabled: true}` -> `{level: 1}` (or whatever level you'd like - level 1 is equivalent to Chalk's current level of support).\r\n\r\nThe levels, as described in [`supports-color`](https://github.com/chalk/supports-color), are:\r\n\r\n0. Disabled\r\n1. 16 colors (basic color)\r\n2. 256 colors (most widely supported mode in terminals that support more than 16 colors)\r\n3. 16 million colors (\"truecolor\") - be sure to check [if your emulator supports Truecolor codes](https://gist.github.com/XVilka/8346728)\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nPlease don't hesitate to give me feedback on the new API.\r\n\r\nThanks for everyone's continued patience - let this be a celebration of some of the first OSS contributions I made here on Github, and let it serve as a relic of some of the great connections I've made through it. 🦄 \r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\ncc @sindresorhus @jbnicolai @dthree @silverwind @stevemao @arthurvr @mikeerickson @rektide @mattbasta, as well as @XVilka (Thank you for your research on support! It has [proven invaluable](http://stackoverflow.com/a/26665998/510036) in many ways.)\r\n\r\nThanks everyone!\r\n\r\n![Look at all the colors!!!!](https://media.giphy.com/media/z0zTHzcwM4VYQ/giphy.gif)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/chalk/chalk/issues/140/reactions","total_count":9,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":9,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/chalk/chalk/issues/140/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
