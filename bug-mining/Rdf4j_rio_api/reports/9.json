This works fine for all serialisations except RDF+XML which fails.  Some more digging and it turns out that it only fails for URI's of this form in predicates; because of this [documented limitation of RDF+XML](https://www.w3.org/TR/REC-rdf-syntax/#section-Serialising).\n\nI realise we currently use an algorithm to determine these qValues for `CONSTRUCTS` preferring Turtle the most, and then weighting it based upon whether we need named graphs etc; however given the limitations of RDF+XML I think we should also be penalising it by giving it a significantly lower qValue, ideally something like `;q=0.1`.\n\nAre there any reasons not to do this?\n","closed_by":{"login":"abrokenjester","id":728776,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcyODc3Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/728776?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/abrokenjester","html_url":"https://github.com/abrokenjester","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abrokenjester/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abrokenjester/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abrokenjester/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abrokenjester/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abrokenjester/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abrokenjester/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abrokenjester/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abrokenjester/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abrokenjester/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-rdf4j/rdf4j/issues/299/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-rdf4j/rdf4j/issues/299/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
