endpoints.\r\n\r\nThe same issue can be experienced when using N-Triples, however for JSON-LD and RDF/XML no error is given. \r\nThe comment  in [TurtleParser](https://github.com/eclipse/rdf4j/blob/master/core/rio/turtle/src/main/java/org/eclipse/rdf4j/rio/turtle/TurtleParser.java#L921) suggest that the \\n and similar (spaces?) should be handled as errors.\r\n\r\nIt's not clear what is an intended behaviour.\r\n\r\nTested with rdf4j 2.2
