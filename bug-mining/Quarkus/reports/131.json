Page A has a fragment called \"content\" which includes page B. Page B has two fragments with rendered=false, only the first is rendered with include.\n\nThere are two endpoints:\n\n- /page/ok -> renders page A completely\n- /page/wrong -> renders only the content fragment within page A.\n\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nBoth endpoints should produce the same output on screen:\n```\nBody content in fragment\n\nFragment B -> A\n\nFragments should not be rendered:\n\nEnd of fragments part\n```\n\n\n### Actual behavior\n\nThe \"ok\" endpoint renders as expected. The \"wrong\" endpoint contains the A and B fragments from page B, even though the rendered property was set to false:\n```\nBody content in fragment\n\nFragment B -> A\n\nFragments should not be rendered:\n\nFragment B -> A\n\nFragment B -> B\n\nEnd of fragments part\n```\n[](url)\n### How to Reproduce?\n\nReproducer: https://github.com/LukasLeppich/qute-fragment-nesting\n\n### Output of `uname -a` or `ver`\n\nMicrosoft Windows [Version 10.0.19045.5073]\n\n### Output of `java -version`\n\nopenjdk version \"17.0.12\" 2024-07-16\n\n### Quarkus version or git rev\n\n3.16.1\n\n### Build tool (ie. output of `mvnw --version` or `gradlew --version`)\n\nApache Maven 3.9.9 (8e8579a9e76f7d015ee5ec7bfcdc97d260186937)\n\n### Additional information\n\n_No response_","closed_by":{"login":"mkouba","id":913004,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkxMzAwNA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/913004?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkouba","html_url":"https://github.com/mkouba","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkouba/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkouba/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkouba/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkouba/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkouba/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkouba/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkouba/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkouba/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkouba/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/quarkusio/quarkus/issues/44281/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/quarkusio/quarkus/issues/44281/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
