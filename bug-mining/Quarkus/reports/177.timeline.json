As we're now exposing this option to the users o Keycloak, I'm having a hard time to explain it to our users and to see where this can be used successfully. \n\n### Expected behavior\n\nA trusted proxy configuration with and without a port should work as expected.\n\n### Actual behavior\n\nIf you specify a trusted proxy with a port, IMHO only a single connection can be established at any given time:\r\n\r\nA TCP connection is identified by the the four elements source IP, source port, target port and target IP. The target port and target IP are where Quarkus listens for incoming connections and are thereby fixed. Source host is the proxy. If I also limit the source port, the proxy can only establish a single connection at a time. And even if that connection is closed, it might take a while until it can open a new connection while it is still in CLOSE_WAIT state AFAIK.\r\n\r\n\n\n### How to Reproduce?\n\n_No response_\n\n###

Just FYI: this async DNS client I used here is something we don't do in Quarkus in general and I remember @cescoffier doesn't fancy async DNS for it's complicated and tricky (my loose interpretation). I used it to avoid blocking warnings. Blocking resolution is cached for a while, I don't remember about this DNS client. Not sure what is ETA for Vert.x 5 in Quarkus, but I remember some comment about 5 months plus.","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/quarkusio/quarkus/issues/comments/2312214503/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"michalvavrik","id":43821672,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzODIxNjcy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/43821672?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/michalvavrik","html_url":"https://github.com/michalvavrik","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michalvavrik/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michalvavrik/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michalvavrik/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michalvavrik/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michalvavrik/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michalvavrik/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michalvavrik/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michalvavrik/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michalvavrik/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":14026637647,"node_id":"MEE_lADOCFbutM6UV_FwzwAAAANEDYFP","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/quarkusio/quarkus/issues/events/14026637647","actor":{"login":"cescoffier","id":402301,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwMjMwMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/402301?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cescoffier","html_url":"https://github.com/cescoffier","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cescoffier/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cescoffier/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cescoffier/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cescoffier/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cescoffier/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cescoffier/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cescoffier/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cescoffier/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cescoffier/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2024-08-27T11:00:30Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":14026637672,"node_id":"SE_lADOCFbutM6UV_FwzwAAAANEDYFo","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/quarkusio/quarkus/issues/events/14026637672","actor":{"login":"cescoffier","id":402301,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwMjMwMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/402301?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cescoffier","html_url":"https://github.com/cescoffier","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cescoffier/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cescoffier/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cescoffier/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cescoffier/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cescoffier/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cescoffier/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cescoffier/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cescoffier/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cescoffier/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2024-08-27T11:00:30Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":14026637707,"node_id":"MEE_lADOCFbutM6UV_FwzwAAAANEDYGL","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/quarkusio/quarkus/issues/events/14026637707","actor":{"login":"ahus1","id":3957921,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5NTc5MjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3957921?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahus1","html_url":"https://github.com/ahus1","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahus1/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahus1/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahus1/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahus1/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahus1/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahus1/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahus1/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahus1/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahus1/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2024-08-27T11:00:30Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":14026637723,"node_id":"SE_lADOCFbutM6UV_FwzwAAAANEDYGb","url":"https://api.github.

see my comment https://github.com/quarkusio/quarkus/pull/43188#issuecomment-2372501741\nThe gist: I added a test with FakeDNS, still it is not testing all code paths. \n\nI'd like to get feedback if the tests are sufficient from your perspective or not. If they are not, I might need more help and probably the code needs a different approach to make the code mode approachable for automated testing. \n\nThe \"future commit\" would only remove some code of the FakeDNS server which are not used. \n\nAll in all I'm still on the fence if the functionality to do a DNS lookup for proxy addresses makes sense at all as it adds overhead, and if the functionality should be dropped.\n\nSo TL;DR: A comment if this goes into the right direction with the tests I added in September would be
