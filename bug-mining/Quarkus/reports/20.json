Describe the bug\r\n\r\nIf a server-side streaming connection is closed by the client, the subscription of Multi<T> should also be cancelled.\r\n\r\n```java\r\n@WebSocket(path = \"/v1/products\")\r\n@RequestScoped\r\npublic class ProductSocket {\r\n\r\n    @OnOpen\r\n    public Multi<Product> onOpen() {\r\n        return Multi.createFrom()\r\n                .ticks()\r\n                .every(Duration.ofSeconds(2))\r\n                .map(aLong -> new Product(String.valueOf(aLong)));\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\n\r\nThe returned `Multi<Product>` should be cancelled if the client closes the WebSocket connection.\r\n\r\n### Actual behavior\r\n\r\nThe `Mutli<Product>` subscription stays active and produces following exceptions every tick:\r\n\r\n```\r\n2024-06-06 13:20:07,851 ERROR [io.qua.web.nex.run.WebSocketEndpointBase] (executor-thread-1) Unable to send text message from Multi: WebSocket connection
