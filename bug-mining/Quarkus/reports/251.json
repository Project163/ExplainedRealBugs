Moreover, in the [docs](https://quarkus.io/guides/opentelemetry#disable-all-or-parts-of-the-opentelemetry-extension), the property is listed there as the official way on how to disable OTel Traces. \n\nFor Keycloak, we need to also disable OTel Traces if not explicitly turned on. Deprecating or even removing the property, we will not be able to control it. I like having the unified approach for OTel Logs, Metrics and Traces as `quarkus.otel.<component>.enabled`.\n\nI'd consider this issue a bug as AFAIK there's no mention of deprecating it, or suggested different approach on how to control it. It kinda seems it was done unintentionally.\n\n@brunobat Could you please check it? Thanks!\n\nI'll provide a PR.\n\n### Expected behavior\n\n`quarkus.otel.traces.enabled` is NOT deprecated\n\n### Actual behavior\n\n`quarkus.otel.traces.enabled` is deprecated\n","closed_by":{"login":"gsmet","id":1279749,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNzk3NDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1279749?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gsmet","html_url":"https://github.com/gsmet","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gsmet/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gsmet/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gsmet/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gsmet/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gsmet/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gsmet/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gsmet/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gsmet/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gsmet/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/quarkusio/quarkus/issues/49527/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/quarkusio/quarkus/issues/49527/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
