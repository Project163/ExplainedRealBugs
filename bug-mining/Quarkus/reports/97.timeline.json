Yeah, it's probably better to move in a more safe direction, not a more lenient one.\r\n\r\nHm, I wouldn't call it \"a more lenient one\" but a \"a convenient one\".\r\n\r\nThe current behavior does not make a lot of sense because if an `addResource()` is used then `overrideConfigKey()` is ignored (due to the ShrinkWrap bug). So no _\"override\"_ really. If we log a warning we should also clarify the javadoc. But we'll have to say \"override\" does not mean \"override\" because of a bug and the behavior may change in the future -> complete mess. If we decide to fail the test then existing tests could fail and the behavior still makes no sense.\r\n\r\nSo I think that we should:\r\n1. Merge the existing `application.properties` and the overriden properties\r\n2. Clarify the javadoc that `overrideConfigKey()` is always preferred\r\n3.

I've never used `withConfigurationResource()` before so I forgot about this use case.\r\n\r\nBTW `withConfigurationResource()` is backed by the same `Properties` object as `overrideConfigKey()`. So if you do `overrideConfigKey(\"foo\",\"bar\")` and then call `withConfigurationResource()` and the file contains `foo=baz` then the final value will be `foo=baz`. And if you call it the other way around the final value will be `foo=bar`.\r\n\r\n>  .withConfigurationResource(\"...\") + overrideConfigKey => Fine (already works)\r\n\r\nWorks but not ideally - see above. \r\n\r\n>   .addAsResource(\"...\", \"application.properties\") + .withConfigurationResource(\"...\") (with or without overrideConfigKey) \r\n\r\nCurrently, the `withConfigurationResource(\"...\")` properties would take precedence.\r\n\r\n> Also, I believe .withConfigurationResource(\"...\") was initially added precisely because .addAsResource(\"...\", \"application.properties\")didn't work withoverrideConfigKey, so... if you make it work, maybe .withConfigurationResource(\"...\")` should be deprecated for removal?\r\n\r\nGood point again ;-). Because if you need to externalize the configuration in a file then something like `addAsResource(\"my-application.properties\")` and `my-application.properties` located in `src/test/resources` work just fine.\r\n\r\nHm, and it seems that `QuarkusProdModeTest` is also affected.

Sorry for bringing this up here, I understand it may be confusing. I brought this up because recently, I've also encountered issues with `io. quarkus.test.junit.QuarkusUnitTest#getConfigOverrides`. They have very similar names, and in my opinion, they should behave in the same way, no matter which testing context you are in. \r\n\r\n> Currently, all of these config properties are backed by the same `ConfigSource` - the one used to load `application.properties`.

> @radcortez This issue is about `QuarkusUnitTest` (from `quarkus-junit5-internal`) which IMO does not reflect the `QuarkusTestProfile` at all.> \r\n> I know. Sorry for bringing this up here, I understand it may be confusing. I brought this up because recently, I've also encountered issues with `io. quarkus.test.junit.QuarkusUnitTest#getConfigOverrides`. They have very similar names, and in my opinion, they should behave in the same way, no matter which testing context you are in.\r\n\r\nNo problem. You mean `QuarkusTestProfile#getConfigOverrides()`, right? Well, these are two completely separate APIs. So the names are similar but the use cases are very different.\r\n\r\n> \r\n> > Currently, all of these config properties are backed by the same `ConfigSource` - the one used to load `application.properties`. Which is probably not a problem because test authors control the deployment structure.\r\n> \r\n> Yes, I know. We could split each API into its own source with its own ordinality, making it clear who overrides who.\r\n\r\nI would personally start with a minimum viable fix and javadoc clarification. And we could improve the things later
