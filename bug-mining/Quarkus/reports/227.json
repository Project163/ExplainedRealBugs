Describe the bug\n\n`ValueExpressionResolver.resolve()` has been explicitly annotated with `@Nullable` in Micrometer 1.11.8:\n\nhttps://github.com/micrometer-metrics/micrometer/issues/4094\n\nBut in Quarkus, this doesn't work as it would throw a NPE here:\n\nhttps://github.com/quarkusio/quarkus/blob/176741713b172d7bf08343e8837d1cb129961c2b/extensions/micrometer/runtime/src/main/java/io/quarkus/micrometer/runtime/MeterTagsSupport.java#L50-L52\n\nI was wondering if we could instead skip creating a `Tag` when the resolver returns null.\n\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nNPE is thrown when the resolver gets invoked.\n\n### Actual behavior\n\nApplication should behave normally, metric tag should not be included if the resolver returns null.\n\n### How to Reproduce?\n\n```java\n@ApplicationScoped\npublic class MyValueExpressionResolver implements ValueExpressionResolver {\n  @Override\n  public String resolve(@Nonnull String expression, @Nullable Object parameter) {\n    return null;\n  }\n}\n```\n\n###
