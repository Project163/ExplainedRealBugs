Logrotation is done system-wide by Linux' logrotate facility. As it seems there is no way to disable quarkus' built in log rotation:\n\nThis is bad, because:\n\n- Ops need to have one interface to configure log rotation. Having to check various service-specific configuration files is not really an option.\n- When trying to debug problems with KeyCloak one often wants to use `tail -f keycloak.log`, but this does not work with KeyCloak, because the way it rotates (rename keycloak.log and continue logging into a different file) breaks this.\n- Also there are additional triggers for log rotating which all seem on by default. This is against best practices. Expected log rotate behaviour is once a day. Doing things entirely differently causes a lot of work for ops responsible not only for KeyCloak but lots of other services in a data center.\n\n\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nThere should be a switch settable in quarkus.properties controlling whether quarkus does log rotation at all. \n\n### Actual behavior\n\nThere is no such switch. As a workaround one can set two properties in quarkus.properties:\n```\nquarkus.log.file.rotation.max-file-size=999M\nquarkus.log.file.rotation.rotate-on-boot=false\n```\n\nThis however has its limits and is not a clean solution.\n\n### How to Reproduce?\n\n_No response_\n\n### Output of `uname -a` or `ver`\n\n_No response_\n\n### Output of `java -version`\n\n_No response_\n\n### Quarkus version or git rev\n\n_No response_\n\n### Build tool (ie. output of `mvnw --version` or `gradlew --version`)\n\n_No response_\n\n### Additional information\n\nThis ticket is forked from KeyCloak issue [38699](https://github.com/keycloak/keycloak/issues/38699) as this is a quarkus and not a KeyCloak issue.","closed_by":{"login":"gsmet","id":1279749,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNzk3NDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1279749?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gsmet","html_url":"https://github.com/gsmet","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gsmet/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gsmet/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gsmet/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gsmet/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gsmet/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gsmet/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gsmet/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gsmet/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gsmet/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/quarkusio/quarkus/issues/47242/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/quarkusio/quarkus/issues/47242/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
