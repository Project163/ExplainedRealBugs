As far as i understand QuarkusComponentTest is just 'mockito-test' with other annotations.\r\n\r\n@octopus-prime It is not.\r\n\r\n> So QuarkusComponentTest still relies on Mockito.\r\n\r\nNot really, you can use `QuarkusComponentTest` even without Mockito and mocks in general.\r\n\r\nThe difference is that `QuarkusComponentTest` starts a real CDI container plus configuration service. Mocks are automatically used if a component has an unsatisfied dependency; e.g. there's a component `Foo` which also depends on `Bar`. If you test `Foo` in your `QuarkusComponentTest` but no `Bar` bean is available then a mock is injected instead.\r\n\r\n> ### Expected behavior\r\n> A fully initialized mockito - with parameter resolvers.\r\n\r\nWe don't use the `MockitoExtension` at all. Therefore, the `@Mock` parameters may not be resolved.\r\n\r\nIf you need to inject an unconfigured mock in a test method argument then replace the `@Mock` with

Ok, so the problem is that `@InjectMock` is not intended for injection of a mock of any arbitrary object. It's meant to be used for beans; see the javadoc _\"Instructs the test engine to inject a mock instance of a bean into the annotated field or parameter.\"_.\r\n\r\nNow in the reproducer, `Foo` and `FooResponse` are not beans but more like DTOs. For these objects, `@org.mockito.Mock` or `Mockito#mock(Class)` are more appropriate, i.e. something like:\r\n```java\r\n    @Test\r\n    void getFoo() {\r\n        Foo foo = Mockito.mock(Foo.class);\r\n        FooResponse fooResponse = Mockito.mock(FooResponse.class);\r\n        \r\n        when(fooRepository.findFoo(\"1\")).thenReturn(foo);\r\n        when(fooMapper.mapFoo(foo)).thenReturn(fooResponse);\r\n\r\n        FooResponse result = fooController.getFoo(\"1\");\r\n\r\n        assertEquals(result, fooResponse);\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\nAgain, for `QuarkusComponentTest` it's not the goal to ease the creation of mocks but create mocked beans automatically  if a component under the test (a CDI bean) has an **unsatisfied dependency**.\r\n\r\nI wonder if we should change the behavior but I think that it does not make sense to create a mock bean for such an object. It seems like a misuse of the API. But I agree that we should at least improve the error message so that it's more clear. If we find a way to detect this kind of misuse...\r\n\r\nCC @manovotn

We should unify this logic. But I'm not quite sure in which way. If we want to be more correct and resource efficient then `@InjectMock` field should not work either.
