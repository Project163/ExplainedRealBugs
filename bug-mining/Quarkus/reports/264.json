Describe the bug\n\nCausing a null pointer exception in a strict Qute template results in a timeout rather than a null pointer exception. It appears to be possible to cause a NPE by referencing the property of a null variable. \n\nI've noticed that the context shows that the variable is resolved to `Property \"size\" not found on the base object \"null\" in expression {bazbaz.size}` but I've not located where the CompletionStage is left hanging in a limbo state rather than being marked as failed when strictRendering is enabled.\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nA descriptive NullPointerException or property-not-found error is returned.\n\n### Actual behavior\n\nTemplateException with the message `Template foo.html [generatedId=1] rendering timeout [10000ms] occured` is thrown instead.\n\n### How to Reproduce?\n\nhttps://github.com/yholkamp/quarkus/tree/typesafe-npe\n\n### Output of `uname -a` or `ver`\n\nLinux ydesk 6.14.0-32-generic #32~24.04.1-Ubuntu SMP PREEMPT_DYNAMIC Tue Sep  2 14:21:04 UTC 2 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linu\n\n### Output of `java -version`\n\nopenjdk version \"17.0.16\" 2025-07-15\n\n### Quarkus version or git rev\n\n3.28.1\n\n### Build tool (ie. output of `mvnw --version` or `gradlew --version`)\n\n3.9.11\n\n### Additional information\n\n_No response_","closed_by":{"login":"mkouba","id":913004,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkxMzAwNA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/913004?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkouba","html_url":"https://github.com/mkouba","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkouba/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkouba/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkouba/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkouba/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkouba/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkouba/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkouba/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkouba/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkouba/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/quarkusio/quarkus/issues/50377/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/quarkusio/quarkus/issues/50377/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
