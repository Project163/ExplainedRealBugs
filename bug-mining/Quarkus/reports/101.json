Everything works fine but for example the Kafka extension creates a huge amount of metrics. I am new to this topic so I have problems to figure out which of the metrics are really important or valuable. I have found a dashboard visualizing some basic metrics: https://grafana.com/grafana/dashboards/14370-jvm-quarkus-micrometer-metrics which I like very much.\r\n\r\n### Implementation ideas\r\n\r\nMy proposal now is to provide similar dashboards for the other extensions: https://quarkus.io/guides/telemetry-micrometer#quarkus-extensions-using-micrometer. This would help everybody visualizing the metrics without spending days in getting familiar with Grafana and creating their own dashboards.\r\n\r\nAfter the creation of this enhancement I have seen that there is a [Grafana Dashboard Generator](https://github.com/jamesfalkner/microprofile-grafana). Unfortunately the generator is not really easy to install/use and the last commit was 4 years ago. So I am not sure if it still works but it gives me another idea: Instead of creating manually Grafana dashboards the dashboard generator could be added to the Quarkus Dev Services or into an own Quarkus extension.","closed_by":{"login":"geoand","id":4374975,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzNzQ5NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4374975?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/geoand","html_url":"https://github.com/geoand","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geoand/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geoand/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geoand/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geoand/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geoand/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geoand/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geoand/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geoand/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geoand/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/quarkusio/quarkus/issues/40933/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/quarkusio/quarkus/issues/40933/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
