To add the extensions to the project, you can run the following command:\n        gradle addExtension --extensions=quarkus-container-image-docker\n```\n\nWhen I use docker (implementation 'io.quarkus:quarkus-container-image-docker') got following result:\n```\nUsing executable podman within the quarkus-container-image-docker extension. Maybe you should use the quarkus-container-image-podman extension instead?\n```\n\nMy build environment uses podman. It seems to be a loop:\n- podman isn't sufficient, requires docker\n- docker complains about using podman\n\n### How to Reproduce?\n\nEnable extension for podman images, insert into dependencies in build.gradle:\n```\nimplementation 'io.quarkus:quarkus-container-image-podman') \n```\n\n### Output of `uname -a` or `ver`\n\nLinux XXXX 5.14.0-503.34.1.el9_5.x86_64 #1 SMP PREEMPT_DYNAMIC Mon Mar 17 21:49:47 EDT 2025 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux, RHEL 9.5\n\n### Output of `java -version`\n\nopenjdk version \"21.0.6\" 2025-01-21 LTS OpenJDK Runtime Environment (Red_Hat-21.0.6.0.7-1) (build 21.0.6+7-LTS) OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM (Red_Hat-21.0.6.0.7-1) (build 21.0.6+7-LTS, mixed mode, sharing)\n\n### Quarkus version or git rev\n\n3.20.0\n\n### Build tool (ie. output of `mvnw --version` or `gradlew --version`)\n\n8.12\n\n### Additional information\n\n_No response_","closed_by":{"login":"geoand","id":4374975,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzNzQ5NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4374975?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/geoand","html_url":"https://github.com/geoand","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geoand/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geoand/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geoand/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geoand/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geoand/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geoand/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geoand/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geoand/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geoand/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/quarkusio/quarkus/issues/47153/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/quarkusio/quarkus/issues/47153/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
