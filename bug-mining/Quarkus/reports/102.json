This has been mentioned in the migration guide https://github.com/quarkusio/quarkus/wiki/Migration-Guide-3.12#spring-compatibility-layer-aligned-with-spring-boot-3 but is completely omitted from https://quarkus.io/guides/spring-data-jpa#what-is-supported\r\n  - IIUC this is a important because only supported features are those explicitly listed in documentation (AKA only support Spring features docs mentions, no others)\r\n- I wonder whether examples should be updated as well. For example https://quarkus.io/guides/spring-data-rest#exposing-many-entities says `Replace the CrudRepository with PagingAndSortingRepository in the FruitsRepository` but won't this mean that previously explained operations https://quarkus.io/guides/spring-data-rest#define-the-repository like `given()\r\n                .when().delete(\"/fruits/1\")\r\n                .then()\r\n                .statusCode(204);` will stop working? I think you cannot just remove `CrudRepository`.\r\n\n\n### Expected behavior\n\n_No response_\n\n### Actual behavior\n\n_No response_\n\n### How to Reproduce?\n\n_No response_\n\n### Output of `uname -a` or `ver`\n\n_No response_\n\n### Output of `java -version`\n\n_No response_\n\n### Quarkus version or git rev\n\n_No response_\n\n### Build tool (ie. output of `mvnw --version` or `gradlew --version`)\n\n_No response_\n\n### Additional information\n\n_No response_","closed_by":{"login":"gsmet","id":1279749,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNzk3NDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1279749?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gsmet","html_url":"https://github.com/gsmet","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gsmet/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gsmet/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gsmet/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gsmet/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gsmet/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gsmet/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gsmet/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gsmet/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gsmet/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/quarkusio/quarkus/issues/43391/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/quarkusio/quarkus/issues/43391/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
