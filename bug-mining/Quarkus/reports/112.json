Describe the bug\n\nI'm using the Quarkus CLI 3.14.4 that I installed through Chocolatey with PowerShell on Windows 10.\r\nWhen I try to update my project through `quarkus:update`, the generated openrewrite recipe contains a non-escaped path to the recipe itself here:\r\n\r\n```\r\nconfigFile = project.getRootProject().file(\"C:\\Users\\xxx\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\quarkus-project-recipe-8715019618984806815.yaml\")\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt should be\r\n\r\n```\r\nconfigFile = project.getRootProject().file(\"C:\\\\Users\\\\xxxx\\\\AppData\\\\Local\\\\Temp\\\\quarkus-project-recipe-8715019618984806815.yaml\")\r\n```\r\n\r\nWith that change, the recipe works fine when I invoke the upgrade through gradle manually.\r\n\r\nMoreover, instead of reporting the error, the upgrade itself is stuck and does nothing.\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nThe upgrade is cancelled on errors and paths should be generated correctly on Windows environments.\n\n### Actual behavior\n\nProcess is stuck and silent, upgrade fails.\n\n### How to Reproduce?\n\n- Windows 10 (11 perhaps also)\r\n- Chocolatey\r\n- PowerShell 7\r\n- quarkus-cli 3.14.4\r\n- An upgradable project\n\n### Output of `uname -a` or `ver`\n\nWindows 10 22H2\n\n### Output of `java -version`\n\nopenjdk version \"22.0.1\" 2024-04-16\n\n### Quarkus version or git rev\n\n3.14.4\n\n### Build tool (ie. output of `mvnw --version` or `gradlew --version`)\n\nGradle 8.8\n\n### Additional information\n\n_No
