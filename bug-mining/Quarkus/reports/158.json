I had to copy and paste it manually from here: https://github.com/quarkusio/quarkus/blob/main/integration-tests/security-webauthn/src/test/java/io/quarkus/it/security/webauthn/test/RenardeCookieFilter.java to make the tests work. \r\n\r\n\r\nMy question is if that's a doc issue where one is expected to create this manually, or if it was meant to be included with the extension by default.
