On the other hand, you can obtain the path parameters, creation time and the data of the initial HTTP request from the connection object.\n\nSo your observer could be rewritten as:\n\n```java\nclass AnyBean {\n\n   public void observeAsync(@ObservesAsync String race_uuid, OpenConnections connections) {\n      for (WebSocketConnection c : connections) {\n         String race_uuid = c.pathParam(\"race_uuid\");\n         // do something with the path param...\n         String username = \"xxxx_\" + c.creationTime().toEpochMilli();\n         // do something with the username...\n         c.sendText(json).subscribe(...);\n      }\n   }\n}\n```\n\nAn idiomatic way to store some arbitrary data in the context of a WebSocket session is to use a `@SessionScoped` CDI bean - each connection is [associated with its own CDI session context](https://quarkus.io/guides/websockets-next-reference#cdi-scopes). This `@SessionScoped` bean can be injected in the endpoint and used within an endpoint callback invocation. However, this bean is not available outside an endpoint callback.\n\nAs a workaround you can store the data in a map where the key is the connection id:\n\n```java\n@ApplicationScoped\npublic class Usernames {\n\n   private final Map<String,String> names = new ConcurrentHashMap<>();\n\n   void connectionOpened(@ObservesAsync @Open WebSocketConnection c) {\n      names.put(c.id(), \"xxxxx_\"+System.milliseconds()); \n   }\n\n   void connectionClosed(@ObservesAsync @Closed WebSocketConnection c) { \n      names.remove(c.id());\n   }\n\n   public void String getUsername(String id) {\n      return names.get(id);\n   }\n}\n```\n\nAnd then use it like:\n \n```java\nclass AnyBean {\n\n   public void observeAsync(@ObservesAsync String race_uuid, OpenConnections connections, Usernames usernames) {\n      for (WebSocketConnection c : connections) {\n         String username =usernames.getUsername(c.id());\n         // do something with the username...\n         c.sendText(json).subscribe(...);\n      }\n   }\n}\n```\n\n`jakarta.websocket.Session.getUserProperties()` returns `Map<String, Object>` which is not a very convenient API. We should try to provide something more usable.","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/quarkusio/quarkus/issues/comments/2401861031/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"mkouba","id":913004,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkxMzAwNA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/913004?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkouba","html_url":"https://github.com/mkouba","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkouba/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkouba/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkouba/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkouba/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkouba/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkouba/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkouba/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkouba/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkouba/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":14569807491,"node_id":"LE_lADOCFbutM6ZYbdnzwAAAANkbZ6D","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/quarkusio/quarkus/issues/events/14569807491","actor":{"login":"mkouba","id":913004,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkxMzAwNA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/913004?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkouba","html_url":"https://github.com/mkouba","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkouba/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkouba/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkouba/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkouba/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkouba/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkouba/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkouba/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkouba/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkouba/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2024-10-09T09:51:46Z","label":{"name":"area/websockets","color":"0366d6"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":14569808249,"node_id":"UNLE_lADOCFbutM6ZYbdnzwAAAANkbaF5","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/quarkusio/quarkus/issues/events/14569808249","actor":{"login":"mkouba","id":913004,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkxMzAwNA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/913004?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkouba","html_url":"https://github.com/mkouba","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkouba/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkouba/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkouba/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkouba/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkouba/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkouba/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkouba/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkouba/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkouba/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"unlabeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2024-10-09T09:51:49Z","label":{"name":"triage/needs-triage","color":"ededed"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":14575388191,"node_id":"REFE_lADOCFbutM6ZYbdnzwAAAANkwsYf","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/quarkusio/quarkus/issues/events/14575388191","actor":{"login":"mkouba","id":913004,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkxMzAwNA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/913004?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkouba","html_url":"https://github.com/mkouba","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkouba/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkouba/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkouba/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkouba/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkouba/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkouba/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkouba/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkouba/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkouba/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"63f7d6d5c5ad0a5bf8050755948ada096c095f64","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mkouba/quarkus/commits/63f7d6d5c5ad0a5bf8050755948ada096c095f64","created_at":"2024-10-09T15:46:45Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"actor
