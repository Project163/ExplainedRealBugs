NOTE: I chose CDI async events because it's \"safer\" compared to `@Observes` which always blocks the current thread. `@ObservesAsync` offloads the logic to the default blocking executor (worker thread in case of `quarkus-vertx`). I mean, we could mention this in the docs, even in javadoc, but that does not prevent users from executing \"creative\" code in those observers. `@ObservesAsync` should mitigate the risk a little ;-).","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/quarkusio/quarkus/issues/42409/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/quarkusio/quarkus/issues/42409/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":13815797560,"node_id":"REFE_lADOCFbutM6SPw87zwAAAAM3fFc4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/quarkusio/quarkus/issues/events/13815797560","actor":{"login":"mkouba","id":913004,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkxMzAwNA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/913004?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkouba","html_url":"https://github.com/mkouba","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkouba/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkouba/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkouba/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkouba/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkouba/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkouba/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkouba/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkouba/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkouba/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"8e2e6e1b9bedb148ecd603b66acb8f4666942379","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mkouba/quarkus/commits/8e2e6e1b9bedb148ecd603b66acb8f4666942379","created_at":"2024-08-09T05:20:38Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":13818920223,"node_id":"CE_lADOCFbutM6SPw87zwAAAAM3q_0f","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/quarkusio/quarkus/issues/events/13818920223","actor":{"login":"geoand","id":4374975,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzNzQ5NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4374975?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/geoand","html_url":"https://github.com/geoand","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geoand/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geoand/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geoand/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geoand/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geoand/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geoand/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geoand/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geoand/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geoand/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2024-08-09T10:22:12Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":13818920800,"node_id":"MIE_lADOCFbutM6SPw87zwAAAAM3q_9g","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/quarkusio/quarkus/issues/events/13818920800","actor":{"login":"quarkus-bot[bot]","id":75068438,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90NzUwNjg0Mzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/90234?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/quarkus-bot%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/quarkus-bot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/quarkus-bot%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/quarkus-bot%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/quarkus-bot%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/quarkus-bot%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/quarkus-bot%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/quarkus-bot%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/quarkus-bot%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/quarkus-bot%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/quarkus-bot%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"milestoned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2024-08-09T10:22:16Z","milestone":{"title":"3.14 -
