Describe the bug\n\nThis is on quarkus 3.21\n\nLiquibase denies loading a local xsd file and also has problems with http:// urls for loading xsd schemas.\nAccording to https://github.com/liquibase/liquibase/issues/2654 the property `-Dliquibase.secureParsing=false` has to be set to be allowed to load these files.\n\nAt the moment I can only add this via\n```\n./mvnw test -Dliquibase.secureParsing=false\n```\n\nPlease extend quarkus-liquibase, resp. the `application.properties` to include the setting like `quarkus.liquibase.secureParsing=false`\n\n### Expected behavior\n\n_No response_\n\n### Actual behavior\n\n_No response_\n\n### How to Reproduce?\n\n_No response_\n\n### Output of `uname -a` or `ver`\n\n_No response_\n\n### Output of `java
