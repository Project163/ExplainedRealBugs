Is there a reason why you have a converter here?\r\n\r\nHaha, yes, IIRC it's only because earlier it was not possible to persuade Quarkus not to hyphenate the enum values in the metadata so I had to introduce a way to map what users got in the docs to the real values.\r\n\r\nAnother detail that makes this case a bit harder is that the enum comes from CXF, so I cannot annotate it with `@ConfigDocEnumValue`.\r\n\r\nIt is only a single property on Quarkus CXF side having this issue (but I have not looked into Camel yet) and I actually agree not-hyphenating makes sense if there is `@WithConverter`. \r\n\r\nIt would be great to have a way to adjust the presented values somehow. \r\n\r\nMaybe a new `@ConfigDocEnumValues` annotation like this?\r\n\r\n```\r\n    @WithDefault(\"Keep-Alive\")\r\n    @WithConverter(ConnectionTypeConverter.class)\r\n    @ConfigDocEnumValues(\"KEEP_ALIVE:Keep-Alive,CLOSE:Close\")\r\n    public ConnectionType
