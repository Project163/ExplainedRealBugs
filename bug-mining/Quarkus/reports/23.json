For some time, we had an adjusted static copy of  `ResteasyReactiveOutputStream` in Quarkus CXF. At some point, we got issues related to chunking reported, that were fixed in Quarkus long time ago. \r\nAfter that, I implemented a script that adapts `ResteasyReactiveOutputStream.java` at Quarkus CXF runtime which is a bit safer, but still rather fragile. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Implementation ideas\r\n\r\nHence, it would be nice if `ResteasyReactiveOutputStream` could be refactored in the following way:\r\n\r\n* Make it independent of RESTeasy\r\n* Possibly move it (along with its ancillary classes) to a separate module in Quarkus that depends only on `vertx-web` but does not depend on RESTeasy\r\n* Or perhaps move the reafctored classes to Vert.x\r\n\r\n@cescoffier encouraged me to prepare a PR which is underway.","closed_by":{"login":"gsmet","id":1279749,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNzk3NDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1279749?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gsmet","html_url":"https://github.com/gsmet","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gsmet/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gsmet/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gsmet/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gsmet/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gsmet/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gsmet/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gsmet/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gsmet/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gsmet/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/quarkusio/quarkus/issues/40994/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/quarkusio/quarkus/issues/40994/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
