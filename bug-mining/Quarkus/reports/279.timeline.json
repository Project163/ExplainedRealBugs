actually we could scan any class annotated with `@ProjectedConstructor` or `@ProjectedFieldName` and find _some_ of those projection types at build time.\n\nThen we could scan any class using `PanacheQuery` and any method calling `PanacheQuery.project` to collect any constant class argument to find more remaining projection types.\n\nOnce we have all these types, we can start building a `Map<Class,String>` for projection queries at build time and it will be hit most of the time.\n\nAlternately, we could indeed have a runtime cache of projection queries per projection types 🤷 This is probably a lot simpler.\n\nBut I have a feeling we'll just be pushing the problem down the ORM layer, because once we've generated our `select new Foo(a, b, c)…` query, ORM will still have to use reflection to find the proper constructor to invoke with the results and this will likely have the same problem as we just moved,
