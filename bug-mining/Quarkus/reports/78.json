Description\n\nusually one writes filters in like so \r\n```\r\norg.bson.conversions.Bson filter = com.mongodb.client.model.Filters.eq('someField', \"someValue\")\r\n```\r\n\r\nfor such simple cases this is appropriate: \r\n```\r\n@MongoEntity(collection = \"namespaces\")\r\npublic class Namespace extends PanacheMongoEntityBase {\r\n    ...\r\n    public Instant activatedUntil;\r\n\r\n    public static Optional<Namespace> findByName(String name) {\r\n        return find(\"name\", name).singleResultOptional();\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\nhowever if i want any more complex stuff i can not put `org.bson.conversions.Bson` into the find function since its only accepting documents, and `org.bson.conversions.Bson` dosen't implement that it is rather the opposite.\r\n\r\ni think this is an unnecessary barrier because i don't see a reason why one should not be able to call\r\n\r\n```\r\n    public static Set<Namespace> findByActivatedUntilOlderThan(Instant activatedUntil) {\r\n        org.bson.conversions.Bson query = com.mongodb.client.model.Filters..lte(\"activatedUntil\", activatedUntil);\r\n        return find(query); <-- breaks\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\nthank you\n\n### Implementation ideas\n\nchange occurrences of `org.bson.Document` to `org.bson.conversions.Bson`","closed_by":{"login":"gsmet","id":1279749,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNzk3NDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1279749?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gsmet","html_url":"https://github.com/gsmet","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gsmet/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gsmet/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gsmet/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gsmet/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gsmet/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gsmet/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gsmet/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gsmet/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gsmet/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/quarkusio/quarkus/issues/42658/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/quarkusio/quarkus/issues/42658/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
