Describe the bug\n\nConfiguring a custom path for the health endpoint like:\n\n```\nquarkus.smallrye-health.root-path=/observe/health\n```\n\nAnd then invoking endpoints such as `/observe/health/live` & `/observe/health/ready` results in them being traced if the OpenTelemetry extension is present. It seems to ignore `/observe/health` but not sub-paths.\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nAll endpoint paths under `quarkus.smallrye-health.root-path` are excluded from tracing.\n\n### Actual behavior\n\nSee details above.\n\n### How to Reproduce?\n\n1. `git clone https://github.com/jamesnetherton/otel-non-app-path-trace.git`\n2. `cd otel-non-app-path-trace`\n3. `mvn clean test`\n\n`OtelTest` will fail. It's expecting to find only one application endpoint being traced. But it finds 3 as the health endpoints are also traced.\n\n### Output of `uname -a` or `ver`\n\n_No response_\n\n### Output of `java -version`\n\n_No response_\n\n### Quarkus version or git rev\n\n3.18.1\n\n### Build tool (ie. output of `mvnw --version` or `gradlew --version`)\n\n_No response_\n\n### Additional information\n\n_No response_","closed_by":{"login":"gsmet","id":1279749,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNzk3NDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1279749?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gsmet","html_url":"https://github.com/gsmet","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gsmet/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gsmet/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gsmet/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gsmet/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gsmet/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gsmet/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gsmet/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gsmet/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gsmet/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/quarkusio/quarkus/issues/46040/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/quarkusio/quarkus/issues/46040/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
