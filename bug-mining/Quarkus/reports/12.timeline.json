But there is a question: Ideally `@Authenticated` and `@RolesAllowed` are just user-friendly alternatives to path-matching HTTP Security policies (perms). So if the authenticated policy is performed eagerly and returns 401, we should be able to perform security checks for security annotations applied on the `@OnOpen` (either by method level or inherited from the class level) and perform it eagerly as well. So we would return 401 and we wouldn't call `@OnError` as the WS connection has never been established. We authenticate the initial HTTP request, not WS
