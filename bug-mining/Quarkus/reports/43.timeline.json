And I agree that it's confusing. \r\n\r\nIt works like this - all `Instant`s are obtained from the _default time zone_. Also all triggers are compared to `now()` which is obtained from the _default time zone_. For example, on my machine the default timezone is `Europe/Prague` and the next fire time for the cron `0 30 20 ? * * *` would be something like `2024-07-08T18:30:00Z`.\r\n\r\nNow if I have `0 30 20 ? * * *` for `Europe/Prague` then `getNextFireTime().atZone(ZoneId.of(\"Europe/Prague\")` returns `2024-07-08T20:30+02:00[Europe/Prague]`. And `0 30 20 ? * * *` for `Europe/London` returns `2024-07-08T19:30+01:00[Europe/London]`. Which is correct because it should be triggered one hour earlier. \r\n\r\nIn your code, `nextFireTime1.compareTo(nextFireTime2)` should return `1` because `testJob1` should be executed after `testJob2`. And it does return `1` on my machine.\r\n\r\nDoes that make sense? Would it help if we clarify the javadoc in a way that `getNextFireTime()` returns an `Instant` obtained from the default time zone?","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/quarkusio/quarkus/issues/comments/2214025205/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"mkouba","id":913004,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkxMzAwNA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/913004?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkouba","html_url":"https://github.com/mkouba","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkouba/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkouba/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkouba/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkouba/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkouba/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkouba/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkouba/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkouba/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkouba/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/quarkusio/quarkus/issues/comments/2214156437","html_url":"https://github.com/quarkusio/quarkus/issues/41717#issuecomment-2214156437","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/quarkusio/quarkus/issues/41717","id":2214156437,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCFbutM6D-ViV","user":{"login":"alanmscott","id":81423652,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxNDIzNjUy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/81423652?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alanmscott","html_url":"https://github.com/alanmscott","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alanmscott/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alanmscott/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alanmscott/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alanmscott/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alanmscott/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alanmscott/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alanmscott/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alanmscott/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alanmscott/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-07-08T13:58:30Z","updated_at":"2024-07-08T13:59:12Z","body":"Hi,\r\n\r\nThanks for sticking with me!\r\n\r\n> And 0 30 20 ? * * * for Europe/London returns 2024-07-08T19:30+01:00[Europe/London].

This example showing a trigger highlights it.\r\nIf the NextFireTime Instant was correct, then all 4 would be expected to trigger simultaneously, but instead, only the London one does, which is correct from a triggering point of view.\r\n\r\nThat's a good point and indeed it does not make a lot of sense from this point of view.\r\n\r\nSo I tested the `quarkus-quartz` extension and it seems that `getNextFireTime()` returns the `Instant` derived from the zoned next fire time.\r\n\r\nI will send a PR tomorrow.
