Describe the bug\n\nCompose Dev Services do not work on Windows, execution ends with \n```\nCaused by: io.smallrye.common.process.AbnormalExitException: Process exited abnormally (pid 6280) with exit code 125 with error output:\nunknown shorthand flag: 'd' in -d\nSee 'docker --help'.\n...\n```\n\nCC @ozangunalp \n\nThe **root cause** is that docker-compose plugin is not found and thus docker execution fails. \n\n\nMe and @michalvavrik did several experiments on these environments:\n * Windows 10 with Docker Desktop\n * Windows Server with Docker CLI and Compose installed using Chocolatey\n \nOur conclusion is that **some environment variables need to be propagated**.\n\nFor Michal (Windows Server with Docker CLI and Compose installed using Chocolatey) it was PROGRAMDATA to detect plugins in `C:\\ProgramData\\Docker\\cli-plugins` as Chocolatey puts stuff there - https://github.com/geicht/chocolatey-packages/blob/master/docker-compose/tools/chocolateyInstall.ps1#L5\n\nIn my case (Windows 10 with Docker Desktop) it was PROGRAMFILES property so that docker-compose was detected.\n\nI did changes in https://github.com/quarkusio/quarkus/blob/main/extensions/devservices/deployment/src/main/java/io/quarkus/devservices/deployment/compose/ComposeRunner.java#L103\nThe initial approach was `env.putAll(System.getenv());` to see that it makes difference and after that trying env properties one by one.\nThe one needed in my case was `env.put(\"PROGRAMFILES\", System.getenv(\"PROGRAMFILES\"));`\n\nThe right property is obviously end system dependent, there are also other env properties which may have influence on other systems - e.g. PROGRAMFILES(X86), COMMONPROGRAMFILES, COMMONPROGRAMFILES(X86).\n\n\nTo me it almost feels like `System.getenv()` should be reflected in the command execution.\n\nWorkaround in case you know the needed property: `quarkus.compose.devservices.env-variables.PROGRAMFILES=C:\\\\Program Files`\n(Please note `\\\\` in the path)\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nCompose Dev Services work well on Windows\n\n### Actual behavior\n\nCompose Dev Services do not work on Windows, execution ends with \n\n### How to Reproduce?\n\n * Get application with jdbc-postgresql - https://code.quarkus.io/?e=jdbc-postgresql&e=rest\n * Add compose-devservices.yml as described in https://quarkus.io/guides/compose-dev-services#basic-example-postgresql-database\n * Run `mvn quarkuus:dev`\n\n### Output of `uname -a` or
