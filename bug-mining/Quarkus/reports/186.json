Describe the bug\n\n### Given\nQuarkus version: 3.17.8\nExtensions: quarkus-junit5-component\n\n### When\nHaving a any CDI bean (dummy MyService used in this case) and test class like\n\n```\n@QuarkusComponentTest\nclass NestedComponentTest {\n\n    @Inject\n    private MyService testUnit;\n\n    @Test\n    void topLevel() {\n    }\n\n    @Nested\n    class NonStaticInnerClass {\n\n        @Test\n        void nested() {\n        }\n    }\n}\n\n```\n\n### Then\n`java.lang.IllegalStateException: No component classes to test`\n\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nThe extension should handle nested test classes, as these are often used to structure more complex test scenarios, for which especially @QuarkusComponentTest is a good candidate to reduce mocking efforts.\n\n### Actual behavior\n\n_No response_\n\n### How to Reproduce?\n\n_No response_\n\n### Output of `uname -a` or `ver`\n\n_No response_\n\n### Output of `java -version`\n\n_No response_\n\n### Quarkus version or
