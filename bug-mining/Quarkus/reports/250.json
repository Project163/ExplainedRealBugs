For example, if there's a template that contains `{#include templateName /}` then Qute will attempt to lookup the template with id `templateName`.\n\n### Implementation ideas\n\nWe cannot change the behavior of the `{#include}` section since it could break existing apps but we could either:\r\n\r\n1. Introduce a new section (`{#includeDynamic}`?) that would treat the first param as an expression, or \r\n2. Introduce a config param (`_dynamic` or some better name?) that would be used to change the default behavior, i.e. something like `{#include templateName _dynamic /}`.","closed_by":{"login":"mkouba","id":913004,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkxMzAwNA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/913004?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkouba","html_url":"https://github.com/mkouba","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkouba/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkouba/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkouba/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkouba/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkouba/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkouba/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkouba/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkouba/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkouba/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/quarkusio/quarkus/issues/41050/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/quarkusio/quarkus/issues/41050/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
