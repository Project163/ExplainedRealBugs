So that they can run in parallel of the main testing.\n\nFor a change to the BOM - an update to SmallRye Config, we have an issue: only the parent `integration-tests/` module is built and the children are not.\n\nSee: https://github.com/quarkusio/quarkus/actions/runs/13415076450/job/37474673050 - change is: https://github.com/quarkusio/quarkus/pull/46359/files\n\nThe initial GIB run perfectly sees that the ITs should be run but somehow when actually executing the ITs, it doesn't. I'm wondering if not having the module in which the change was made could be a problem for GIB or if the fact we pass the modules as `-f integration-tests -pl!exclusion1...` is being problematic?\n\nIn the IT run itself, GIB says:\n\n```\n[INFO] No changed artifacts detected: Executing validate goal on current project only, skipping all submodules.\n[INFO] gitflow-incremental-builder exiting...\n```\n\n@famod I would appreciate some help to figure out what we should do to fix it.\n\nSee:\n\nhttps://github.com/quarkusio/quarkus/blob/4ec24b1b6f2828fd96999abf81c5094f404ad797/.github/workflows/ci-actions-incremental.yml#L59\n\nand:\n\nhttps://github.com/quarkusio/quarkus/blob/4ec24b1b6f2828fd96999abf81c5094f404ad797/.github/workflows/ci-actions-incremental.yml#L441-L448","closed_by":{"login":"gsmet","id":1279749,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNzk3NDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1279749?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gsmet","html_url":"https://github.com/gsmet","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gsmet/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gsmet/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gsmet/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gsmet/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gsmet/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gsmet/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gsmet/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gsmet/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gsmet/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/quarkusio/quarkus/issues/46367/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/quarkusio/quarkus/issues/46367/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
