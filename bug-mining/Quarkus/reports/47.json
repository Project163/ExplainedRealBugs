Description\n\n`JpaRepository#getOne(ID)` was marked deprecated a long time ago: https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-data-jpa/issues/1697\r\nand javadoc suggests to use `getReferenceById`: https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-data-jpa/pull/2398\r\nIn Quarkus, we are seeing this deprecation since #40344.\r\n\r\nNow, when trying to use `getReferenceById` the following is thrown:\r\n```\r\nio.quarkus.spring.data.runtime.FunctionalityNotImplemented: Method getReferenceById of class foo.BarRepository_cbd379646a149ba2465a399aca3df36673c2a7c1Impl from Spring Data has not
