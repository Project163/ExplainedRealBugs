Also it would be a breaking change because AFAIK the FQCN of the job is used in Quartz tables.\n\nFYI I've tried to implement a simple (and naive.. yet working ;-) mutex/non-concurrent job with the default/simple scheduler; it's based on the `SkipPredicate` API, it leverages `SuccessfulExecution`/`FailedExecution` events and Hibernate + Panache +  JTA + PostgreSQL: https://github.com/mkouba/scheduler-mutex/blob/main/src/main/java/org/acme/Jobs.java ","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/quarkusio/quarkus/issues/comments/2435212266/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"mkouba","id":913004,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkxMzAwNA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/913004?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkouba","html_url":"https://github.com/mkouba","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkouba/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkouba/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkouba/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkouba/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkouba/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkouba/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkouba/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkouba/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkouba/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":14856140781,"node_id":"SE_lADOCFbutM6bfa35zwAAAAN1frft","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/quarkusio/quarkus/issues/events/14856140781","actor":{"login":"manovotn","id":4181235,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQxODEyMzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4181235?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/manovotn","html_url":"https://github.com/manovotn","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manovotn/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manovotn/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manovotn/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manovotn/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manovotn/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manovotn/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manovotn/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manovotn/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manovotn/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2024-10-24T17:44:56Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/quarkusio/quarkus/issues/comments/2437979656","html_url":"https://github.com/quarkusio/quarkus/issues/44048#issuecomment-2437979656","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/quarkusio/quarkus/issues/44048","id":2437979656,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCFbutM6RUJ4I","user":{"login":"mkouba","id":913004,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkxMzAwNA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/913004?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkouba","html_url":"https://github.com/mkouba","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkouba/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkouba/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkouba/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkouba/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkouba/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkouba/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkouba/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkouba/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkouba/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-10-25T14:31:00Z","updated_at":"2024-10-25T14:31:00Z","body":"I think that we'll need to introduce a new annotation because `@Scheduled#concurrentExecution=SKIP` does not really map to `@DisallowedConcurrentExecution`.

We only trigger the execution from a Quartz thread and return immediately. We offload the execution to the corresponding executor (event loop, worker thread, virtual thread executor). The main reason is consistency and propagation of the Vert.x duplicated context.\n\n### What can we do?\nWe could detect `quarkus.quartz.run-blocking-scheduled-method-on-quartz-thread=false` and fail during startup if `@Nonconcurrent` is used.

way and I sadly don't have a better one up my sleeve.\n\nThe [initial comment](https://github.com/quarkusio/quarkus/issues/44048#issue-2608705017)  shows a \"workaround\" that's actually more flexible as you can keep scheduling other jobs on whichever thread pool you need while offloading these non-concurrent jobs directly to Quartz. OTOH, the draft requires you to explicitly set `quarkus.quartz.run-blocking-scheduled-method-on-quartz-thread` property.\n\nUltimately, @vsevel and @vondacho should have the last word on that as you are running this use case. So please, let us know if the draft presented here would help you, or not.\n\nAnd last but not least, [Martin's example](https://github.com/quarkusio/quarkus/issues/44048#issuecomment-2435212266) with mutex implementation should also be taken into consideration as that seems to be applicable to arbitrary scheduled method with Quarkus if need be (or perhaps if you just don't want to go through the

It only works if `quarkus.quartz.run-blocking-scheduled-method-on-quartz-thread=true`\n\nthat would not be an issue. we have our own extensions where we can force the apps to set this property.\n\n>

are no thousands of timers typically in an application, so we can spare some blocking threads for this activity.\n\n>  The main reason is consistency and propagation of the Vert.x duplicated context.\n\nthis means that we would not get a duplicated context. I checked with the workaround that we can force a request scope. I suppose we would be able to do the same thing with your code change proposition?\nwhat are other consistency issues?\n\n> We could also detect @Nonconcurrent declared on a non-blocking/virtual

property from our extensions.\n\n> ... shows a \"workaround\" that's actually more flexible as you can keep scheduling other jobs on whichever thread pool you need while offloading these non-concurrent jobs directly to Quartz\n\nour original need was to be able to run exclusive timers on quartz, and anything else on the simple scheduler.\nwe do not need the extra flexibility offered by the workaround.\nfurthermore, we actually don't feel we have a better solution with the workaround as:\n- we execute on a blocking thread, which is a quartz thread just like in the PR\n- the declaration is more cumbersome as we have to create a new job class, and schedule it programmatically at app startup\n\n> Ultimately, @vsevel and @vondacho should have the last word on that as you are running this use case.\n\nwe appreciate the effort @mkouba . we believe your proposition brings some decent value. if this feature was available, we would certainly use it, as we would avoid a more complex declaration, and the limitations do not seem to apply, at least in our situation.\nif you think this is not really worth the effort, we would gladly stay with the workaround. that would not be an issue.\n\nas our utilization of quartz really revolves around non concurrent jobs, I think your proposition is valuable, assuming this is not bringing too much complexity into the quartz extension.\n\n\n\n\n","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/quarkusio/quarkus/issues/comments/2457372454/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"vsevel","id":6041620,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYwNDE2MjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6041620?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vsevel","html_url":"https://github.com/vsevel","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vsevel/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vsevel/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vsevel/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vsevel/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vsevel/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vsevel/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vsevel/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vsevel/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vsevel/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":15121220956,"node_id":"MEE_lADOCFbutM6bfa35zwAAAAOFS4Vc","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/quarkusio/quarkus/issues/events/15121220956","actor":{"login":"mkouba","id":913004,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkxMzAwNA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/913004?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkouba","html_url":"https://github.com/mkouba","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkouba/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkouba/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkouba/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkouba/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkouba/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkouba/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkouba/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkouba/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkouba/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2024-11-05T14:47:25Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":15121220976,"node_id":"SE_lADOCFbutM6bfa35zwAAAAOFS4Vw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/quarkusio/quarkus/issues/events/15121220976","actor":{"login":"mkouba","id":913004,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkxMzAwNA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/913004?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkouba","html_url":"https://github.com/mkouba","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkouba/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkouba/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkouba/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkouba/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkouba/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkouba/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkouba/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkouba/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkouba/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2024-11-05T14:47:25Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":15121221016,"node_id":"MEE_lADOCFbutM6bfa35zwAAAAOFS4WY","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/quarkusio/quarkus/issues/events/15121221016","actor":{"login":"vondacho","id":3777501,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3Nzc1MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3777501?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vondacho","html_url":"https://github.com/vondacho","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vondacho/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vondacho/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vondacho/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vondacho/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vondacho/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vondacho/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vondacho/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vondacho/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vondacho/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2024-11-05T14:47:25Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":15121221033,"node_id":"SE_lADOCFbutM6bfa35zwAAAAOFS4Wp","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/quarkusio/quarkus/issues/events/15121221033","actor":{"login":"vondacho","id":3777501,"node_id":"MDQ6VXN
