templates with possibly frontmatter?\r\n\r\n@mkouba  how could we make this fit in the Quarkus/Qute context?\r\n\r\ncc @maxandersen @ebullient \r\n\r\nI asked AI to explain what is multi-stage processing in this context:\r\n\r\n## Multi-Stage Processing in Static Site Generation\r\n\r\nMulti-stage processing in the context of static site generation (SSG) generally refers to a structured approach where the generation of the final static site output is broken down into several distinct phases or stages. Each stage performs specific tasks on the content and templates, transforming them step-by-step until the final HTML files are produced. Here’s how these stages typically play out:\r\n\r\n1. **Content Loading and Parsing**:\r\n    - **Markdown Parsing**: Raw markdown files (often containing frontmatter) are loaded and parsed. Frontmatter, usually in YAML or TOML format, is extracted to provide metadata such as titles, dates, tags, and other custom fields.\r\n    - **Frontmatter Extraction**: The frontmatter is separated from the main content and processed. This metadata guides subsequent stages, like template selection and content organization.\r\n\r\n2. **Template Rendering**:\r\n    - **Content Insertion**: Parsed markdown content is inserted into predefined templates. These templates define the structure of the pages and often include placeholders for dynamic content.\r\n    - **Template Engines**: Use of template engines (like Handlebars, Jinja, or Liquid) to inject content into the templates. These engines allow for logic such as loops, conditionals, and partials (reusable template snippets).\r\n\r\n3. **Static Asset Handling**:\r\n    - **CSS and JavaScript**: Compilation and minification of stylesheets and scripts. This might involve tools like Sass for CSS pre-processing or Webpack for bundling JavaScript.\r\n    - **Image Optimization**: Optimization of images to reduce file sizes and improve loading times, often using tools like ImageMagick or specific SSG plugins.\r\n\r\n4. **Content Transformation**:\r\n    - **Link Processing**: Relative links within the markdown are converted to appropriate URLs. This includes handling internal links between pages.\r\n    - **Content Enhancements**: Additional processing like embedding code snippets, generating table of contents, or adding syntax highlighting for code blocks.\r\n\r\n5. **Output Generation**:\r\n    - **Static File Generation**: The final HTML files are generated, combining the parsed markdown content with the templates and any additional transformations applied.\r\n    - **Deployment Preparation**: Organizing the output into a directory structure suitable for deployment to a static site hosting service (like Netlify, GitHub Pages, or Vercel).\r\n\r\n6. **Build Optimization** (Optional):\r\n    - **Caching**: Implementing caching strategies to avoid reprocessing unchanged content.\r\n    - **Incremental Builds**: Building only the parts of the site that have changed since the last build to save time and resources.\r\n\r\n### Example Workflow\r\n\r\n- **Stage 1**: Load and parse markdown files. Extract and process frontmatter.\r\n- **Stage 2**: Render content using a template engine. This might involve loading layouts and injecting content.\r\n- **Stage 3**:  ~~Process static assets like CSS and JavaScript~~ => Web Bundler\r\n- **Stage 4**: Perform content transformations such as link rewriting and adding enhancements.\r\n- **Stage 5**: Generate final HTML output and prepare for deployment.\r\n\r\nEach stage builds on the previous one, ensuring that by the end of the process, you have a fully-rendered, optimized static site ready for deployment.\r\n\r\n### Benefits of Multi-Stage Processing\r\n\r\n1. **Modularity**: Each stage can be developed, tested, and maintained independently.\r\n2. **Scalability**: It allows for more complex build processes as the site grows, accommodating more content and features without becoming unwieldy.\r\n3. **Efficiency**: Incremental builds and caching can significantly speed up the generation process for large sites.\r\n4. **Customization**: Different stages can be customized or extended based on specific project needs, such as adding new transformation steps or integrating additional tools.\r\n\r\nBy breaking down the site generation process into manageable stages, multi-stage processing provides a clear framework for building static sites efficiently and effectively.\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/quarkiverse/quarkus-qute-web/issues/91/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/quarkiverse/quarkus-qute-web/issues/91/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":13267835816,"node_id":"REFE_lADOCFbutM6NQyCXzwAAAAMW0xuo","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/quarkusio/quarkus/issues/events/13267835816","actor":{"login":"mkouba","id":913004,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkxMzAwNA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/913004?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkouba","html_url":"https://github.com/mkouba","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkouba/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkouba/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkouba/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkouba/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkouba/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkouba/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkouba/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkouba/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkouba/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"d1d280326ee021bc290915517b517a3341a74797","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mkouba/quarkus/commits/d1d280326ee021bc290915517b517a3341a74797","created_at":"2024-06-24T14:59:13Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"actor":{"login":"mkouba","id":913004,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkxMzAwNA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/913004?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkouba","html_url":"https://github.com/mkouba","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkouba/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkouba/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkouba/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkouba/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkouba/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkouba/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkouba/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkouba/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkouba/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-06-24T15:00:24Z","updated_at":"2024-06-24T15:00:24Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/quarkusio/quarkus/issues/41391","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/quarkusio/quarkus","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/quarkusio/quarkus/issues/41391/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/quarkusio/quarkus/issues/41391/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/quarkusio/quarkus/issues/41391/events","html_url":"https://github.com/quarkusio/quarkus/pull/41391","id":2370476221,"node_id":"PR_kwDOCFbutM5zYU98","number":41391,"title":"Qute:
