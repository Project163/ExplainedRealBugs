However, it is contained within the `results.<test-class>.skipped` property. Is this a bug? Sure, it's a minor one, but Dev UI has to be aware of this.\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nI would expect the skipped test to be part of both properties.\n\n### Actual behavior\n\nThe skipped test does not occur in the top-level `skipped` array. \n\n### How to Reproduce?\n\n1. Mark a test to be `@Disabled` and run the tests\r\n2. In Dev UI, debug the `QwcContinuousTesting._results` property\n\n### Output of `uname -a` or `ver`\n\nDarwin head 23.6.0 Darwin Kernel Version 23.6.0: Mon Jul 29 21:14:30 PDT 2024; root:xnu-10063.141.2~1/RELEASE_ARM64_T6030 arm64\n\n### Output of `java -version`\n\nopenjdk version \"21.0.4\" 2024-07-16 OpenJDK Runtime Environment Homebrew (build 21.0.4) OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM Homebrew (build 21.0.4, mixed mode, sharing)\n\n### Quarkus version or git rev\n\nHEAD\n\n### Build tool (ie. output of `mvnw --version` or `gradlew --version`)\n\nApache Maven 3.9.8 (36645f6c9b5079805ea5009217e36f2cffd34256)\n\n### Additional information\n\n_No response_","closed_by":{"login":"gsmet","id":1279749,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNzk3NDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1279749?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gsmet","html_url":"https://github.com/gsmet","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gsmet/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gsmet/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gsmet/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gsmet/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gsmet/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gsmet/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gsmet/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gsmet/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gsmet/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/quarkusio/quarkus/issues/43067/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/quarkusio/quarkus/issues/43067/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
