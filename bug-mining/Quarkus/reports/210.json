don't know atm.\n\nHere is how application.properties looks like:\n`my.property=${MY_PROPERTY}`\n`%dev,test.my.property=testingQuarkus`\n\n**Important**: there was 0 issues with running these tests natively with Quarkus 3.17.8\n\nHas there anything changed with 3.19.3 or 3.19.4 version that I have to take into account?\n\nIf there is any info you'd like me to provide more, please let me know.\n\nHere is link to [ZulipChat](https://quarkusio.zulipchat.com/#narrow/channel/187030-users/topic/Quarkus.203.2E19.2E3.20-.20quarkusIntTest.20issue.20with.20properties/near/506717986) where I initially touched upon the topic.\n\nThank You for support.\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nGreetingResourceTestEndToEnd from package **src/integrationTest/kotlin/endtoend** and annotated with **io.quarkus.test.junit.QuarkusIntegrationTest** passes successfully as it does with quarkus 3.17.8\n\n### Actual behavior\n\n2 issues I see from tests report:\n\n1) Failed to load config value of type class java.lang.String for: my.property\n\n2) Waited 60 seconds for build/quarkus.log to contain info about the listening port and protocol but no such info was found. Check if the options quarkus.log.level and quarkus.log.file.level are at least INFO (or more verbose).\nFailed to launch the application. The application logs can be found at: /Users/XYZ/Desktop/code-with-quarkus/build/quarkus.log\n\n\n### How to Reproduce?\n\nLink to reproducer - [GitHub](https://github.com/DudekJakub/quarkus-3-19-3-native-testing-issue)\n\nThere are 3 branches:\n\n- **master** with quarkus 3.19.3 -> it is crucial for me and my team as we're going with it on PRD soon\n- **quarkus-3-19-4-error** -> has the same issue as 3.19.3\n- **quarkus-3-17-8-ok** -> here everything works correctly\n\nHere is how I run these tests with GRAALVM (Java 21.0.1-graalce):\n`./gradlew quarkusIntTest \\\n        --stacktrace \\\n        -Dquarkus.test.native-image-profile=test \\\n        -Dquarkus.test.profile=test \\\n        -Dquarkus.test.integration-test-profile=test \\\n        -Dquarkus.profile=test \\\n        -Dquarkus.package.jar.enabled=false \\\n        -Dquarkus.native.enabled=true`\n\n### Output of `uname -a` or `ver`\n\n_No response_\n\n### Output of `java -version`\n\n_No response_\n\n### Mandrel or GraalVM version (if different from Java)\n\nJava 21.0.1-graalce\n\n### Quarkus version or git rev\n\n3.19.3\n\n### Build tool (ie. output of `mvnw --version` or `gradlew --version`)\n\nGradle 8.12\n\n### Additional information\n\n_No response_","closed_by":{"login":"gsmet","id":1279749,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNzk3NDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1279749?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gsmet","html_url":"https://github.com/gsmet","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gsmet/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gsmet/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gsmet/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gsmet/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gsmet/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gsmet/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gsmet/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gsmet/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gsmet/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/quarkusio/quarkus/issues/46912/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/quarkusio/quarkus/issues/46912/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
