Since PgPool was deprecated i updated my code to use io.vertx.mutiny.sqlclient.Pool this works fine in the Java version. \n`Pool.pool(vertx, PgConnectOptions.fromUri(reactiveBaseUrl + finalDataBase).setUser(username)\n\t\t\t\t\t.setPassword(password).setCachePreparedStatements(true), options);`\n\nHowever in the native compilation i get an error \"No implementations of interface io.vertx.sqlclient.spi.Driver found that accept connection options io.vertx.pgclient.PgConnectOptions@7a4d8706\".\n\nI also tried it with SqlConnectOptions but had the same result.\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nIf quarkus-reactive-pg-client is present in the build the driver should be made discoverable if a pool is constructed via Pool.pool(...)\n\n### Actual behavior\n\n_No response_\n\n### How to Reproduce?\n\n1. Create quarkus app with quarkus-reactive-pg-client\n2. Call Pool.pool to create a new pool from code\n\n\n### Output of `uname -a` or `ver`\n\nWindows 11/Ubuntu server\n\n### Output of `java -version`\n\nTemurin JDK 21 latest\n\n### Mandrel or GraalVM version (if different from Java)\n\n_No response_\n\n### Quarkus version or git rev\n\n3.23.4\n\n### Build tool (ie. output of `mvnw --version` or `gradlew --version`)\n\n_No response_\n\n### Additional information\n\n What's a bit weird to me is that i also have an injected Pool (for my standard connection) using postgres via application.propperties config and that works. So the driver is present in general. I also tried using PgBuilder directly but that gives me the same error.","closed_by":{"login":"zakkak","id":1435395,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MzUzOTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1435395?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zakkak","html_url":"https://github.com/zakkak","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zakkak/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zakkak/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zakkak/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zakkak/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zakkak/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zakkak/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zakkak/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zakkak/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zakkak/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/quarkusio/quarkus/issues/50140/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/quarkusio/quarkus/issues/50140/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
