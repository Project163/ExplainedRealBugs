Since 3.16.1 we have an issue with calling a Java method. The parameter in the Java method is always the same value where in the HTML file the field has the correct value within a loop.\n\nHtml fragments:\n\n```\n{#for project in schedules.projects}\n  {#for name in schedules.names}\n    <script>console.log(\"Name: Project.name = [{project.name}]\");</script>\n    {#let schedule = schedules.forProjectAndName(project, name, project_index)}\n    ........\n  {/for}\n{/for}\n```\n\nIn the browser console logging, the value for project.name is correct for each project in 'schedules.projects'\n\nJava Code:\n\n```\npublic PipelineSchedule forProjectAndName(final Project project, final String scheduleName, final int indexCount) {\nlog.info(\"Name: Project.Name = [{}], ScheduleName = [{}], indexCount = [{}]\", project.name(), scheduleName, indexCount);\n```\nThe java logging shows always the first project name from the loop in the html code. Anyone an idea what is going on? And how to solve this?\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nThat the loop works the same as in Quarkus version 3.15\n\n### Actual behavior\n\nThe value of the parameter in the Java method is always of the first entry in the loop.\n\n### How to Reproduce?\n\n_No response_\n\n### Output of `uname -a` or `ver`\n\n_No response_\n\n### Output of `java -version`\n\n_No response_\n\n### Quarkus version or git rev\n\n3.15 versus 3.16\n\n### Build tool (ie. output of `mvnw --version` or `gradlew --version`)\n\nmvn\n\n### Additional information\n\n_No response_","closed_by":{"login":"Madere","id":3578539,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1Nzg1Mzk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3578539?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Madere","html_url":"https://github.com/Madere","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Madere/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Madere/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Madere/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Madere/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Madere/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Madere/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Madere/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Madere/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Madere/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/quarkusio/quarkus/issues/44797/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/quarkusio/quarkus/issues/44797/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
