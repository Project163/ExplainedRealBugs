Describe the bug\n\nThis Qute template is rendered as `0 is not 0`:\n```smarty\n{@long number=0L}\n{number} is {#if number == 0}0{#else}not 0{/if}\n```\nThe same happens when comparing a `long` returned from a method with an `int` in a template.\nI didn't check for other types.\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nPrimitive numbers should be compared by their value, not their type.\n\n### Actual behavior\n\n`==` and `!=` fail with primitive numbers of different data types.\n\n### How to Reproduce?\n\n_No response_\n\n### Output of `uname -a` or `ver`\n\n_No response_\n\n### Output of `java -version`\n\n_No response_\n\n### Quarkus version or git rev\n\n3.15.2\n\n### Build tool (ie. output of `mvnw --version` or `gradlew --version`)\n\n_No response_\n\n### Additional information\n\n_No
