Describe the bug\n\n\nI want to load classes as resources from the class loader and For that I am reusing `org.springframework.core.io.support.PathMatchingResourcePatternResolver`. \n\nUnfortunately when using the one of the production classloader of Quarkus, the RunnerClassLoader, this latter do not manage to load the resource effectively, as opposed to the System classloader or the dev mode QuarkusClassLoader.\n\nWhen loading a path resource, the classloader is stripping the last `\\` from the resource, i.e: \n\nWhen loading the path org/acme/ with RunnerClassLoader :\n```shell\nURL [jar:file:/User/Projects/Support/Misc/Quarkus/resolver-issue/target/quarkus-app/app/resolver-issue-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT.jar!/org/acme]\n```\n\nAnd when loading the same path with QuarkusClassLoader\n\n```shell\nURL [file:/User/Projects/Support/Misc/Quarkus/resolver-issue/target/classes/org/acme/]\n```\n\nA typical identical issue has been reported and fixed some years ago on the QuarkusClassLoader, see: https://github.com/quarkusio/quarkus/issues/10943\n\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nTrailing slash is not stripped out so that I can find my resource to the correct location\n\n### Actual behavior\n\nTrailing slash is removed making the computation of relative resources wrong.\n\n### How to Reproduce?\n\nI created a reproducer here https://github.com/vietk/QuarkusReproducer\n\n### Output of `uname -a` or `ver`\n\n_No response_\n\n### Output of `java -version`\n\n_No response_\n\n### Quarkus version or git rev\n\n_No response_\n\n### Build tool (ie. output of `mvnw --version` or `gradlew --version`)\n\n_No response_\n\n### Additional information\n\nIf a fix is shipped it would be nice to have a retrofit in the LTS version of Quarkus
