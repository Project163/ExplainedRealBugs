But extension does not react to this property. Instead it actually is configured by \"quarkus.otel.exporter.otlp.**traces**.endpoint\".\n\n\nIn my setup I changed the grafana-otel-lgtm service to use different port than default 4317. Even when I configure it to the `quarkus.otel.exporter.otlp.logs.endpoint=http://localhost:32791` no logs arrive to the backend and app complains about not being able to connect to the port 4317:\n```\nFailed to export TraceRequestMarshalers. The request could not be executed. Full error message: Connection refused: localhost/127.0.0.1:4317\nFailed to export LogsRequestMarshalers. The request could not be executed. Full error message: Connection refused: localhost/127.0.0.1:4317\n```\n\nProblems with both logs and traces export is fixed, when I configure quarkus.otel.exporter.otlp.**traces**.endpoint.\n\nFrom my testing it seems like property `quarkus.otel.exporter.otlp.logs.endpoint` is ignored entirely. Even when I set it to complete bogus like `quarkus.otel.exporter.otlp.logs.endpoint=http://wtfWhatisThis:456123748` it works, as long as *traces* property is set correctly.\n\n### Expected behavior\n\n_No response_\n\n### Actual behavior\n\n_No response_\n\n### How to Reproduce?\n\n_No response_\n\n### Output of `uname -a` or `ver`\n\n_No response_\n\n### Output of `java -version`\n\n_No response_\n\n### Quarkus version or git rev\n\n999-SNAPSHOT\n\n### Build tool (ie. output of `mvnw --version` or `gradlew --version`)\n\n_No response_\n\n### Additional information\n\n_No response_","closed_by":{"login":"geoand","id":4374975,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzNzQ5NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4374975?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/geoand","html_url":"https://github.com/geoand","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geoand/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geoand/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geoand/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geoand/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geoand/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geoand/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geoand/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geoand/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geoand/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/quarkusio/quarkus/issues/46351/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/quarkusio/quarkus/issues/46351/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
