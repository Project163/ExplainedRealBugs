This is because `quarkusIntTest` depends on `test` and the `--test` command line option used by IntelliJ to isolate the test is not propagated to that dependency.\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nRunning a single test should only execute that test.\n\n### Actual behavior\n\nOther tests (those run by the `test` Gradle task) are also run.\n\n### How to Reproduce?\n\nReproducer: [quarkus-reproducer.zip](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/17672391/quarkus-reproducer.zip)\n\n**Steps to reproduce**\n\n1. Open the project in IntelliJ.\n2. In `GreetingResourceIT.java` click the run icon that appears next to the class declaration, then choose `quarkusIntTest` and then ‘run’.\n3. Observe that `GreetingResourceTest` is also run.\n\nNote that modifying the run configuration to add `-x test` to the command line will lead to the correct behaviour.\n\n### Output of `uname -a` or `ver`\n\nDarwin Rods-MacBook-Pro.local 24.1.0 Darwin Kernel Version 24.1.0: Thu Oct 10 21:05:23 PDT 2024; root:xnu-11215.41.3~2/RELEASE_ARM64_T6031 arm64\n\n### Output of `java -version`\n\nopenjdk version \"21.0.4\" 2024-07-16 OpenJDK Runtime Environment Homebrew (build 21.0.4) OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM Homebrew (build 21.0.4, mixed mode, sharing)\n\n### Quarkus version or git rev\n\n3.16.2\n\n### Build tool (ie. output of `mvnw --version` or `gradlew --version`)\n\nGradle 8.9\n\n### Additional information\n\n_No response_","closed_by":{"login":"aloubyansky","id":323379,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyMzM3OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/323379?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aloubyansky","html_url":"https://github.com/aloubyansky","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aloubyansky/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aloubyansky/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aloubyansky/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aloubyansky/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aloubyansky/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aloubyansky/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aloubyansky/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aloubyansky/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aloubyansky/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/quarkusio/quarkus/issues/44383/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/quarkusio/quarkus/issues/44383/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
