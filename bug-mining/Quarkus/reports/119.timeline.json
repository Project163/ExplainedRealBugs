wonder if there's not something very odd because from what I can see, the big CHM you have in your heap dump is the `resourceCache` of the JDK `AppClassLoader` and I wouldn't expect us to use this CL to load the local resources - except if they don't exist... but given `KnownPathResourceManager`, I would have expected us to only serve the resources we know about. But we are not actually checking the set of known `files` when getting the resource in `KnownPathResourceManager`, it might be the problem.\n\nI'm not exactly versed in this area so it's all handwaving at this stage.\n\nNow, I'm not entirely sure we only need to serve the known files but I think that's the intent and maybe a simple patch like the following might actually fix your issue:\n\n```diff\ndiff --git a/extensions/undertow/runtime/src/main/java/io/quarkus/undertow/runtime/KnownPathResourceManager.java b/extensions/undertow/runtime/src/main/java/io/quarkus/undertow/runtime/KnownPathResourceManager.java\nindex 0e665ab14a5..f0abd8c0723 100644\n--- a/extensions/undertow/runtime/src/main/java/io/quarkus/undertow/runtime/KnownPathResourceManager.java\n+++ b/extensions/undertow/runtime/src/main/java/io/quarkus/undertow/runtime/KnownPathResourceManager.java\n@@ -69,6 +69,9 @@ public Resource getResource(String path) throws IOException {\n         if (directories.contains(path)) {\n             return new DirectoryResource(path);\n         }\n+        if (!files.contains(path)) {\n+            return null;\n+        }\n         return underlying.getResource(path);\n     }\n \n```\n\nIf you follow the instructions in https://github.com/quarkusio/quarkus/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#building-main , and apply this small patch before building, you should be able to test this theory with your code base.\n\nYou would also have to check that it actually still serves the existing resources properly :).\n\nHow do you reproduce the issue with your reproducer?
