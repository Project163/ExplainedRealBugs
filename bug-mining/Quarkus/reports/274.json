Describe the bug\n\nQute generator generates an incorrect resolver for multiple namespace extension methods _with the same name, number of params but different param types_.\n\nReproducer: https://github.com/suchwerk/qute-method-overloading-resolution\n\nAlso discussed on Zulip: https://quarkusio.zulipchat.com/#narrow/channel/187030-users/topic/Qute.20template.20extension/with/271565021\n\nThere is a workaround where it's possible to keep the method names - each extension method must define a different priority, i.e. something like:\n```java\n@TemplateExtension(namespace = \"my\")\npublic class MyExtensions {\n\n    static String someFunctionName(Number a, Number b) {\n        return \"Number, Number\";\n    }\n\n    @TemplateExtension(namespace = \"my\", priority = 6)\n    static String someFunctionName(String a, String b) {\n        return \"String, String\";\n    }\n\n    @TemplateExtension(namespace = \"my\", priority = 7)\n    static String someFunctionName(String a, Number b) {\n        return \"String, Number\";\n    }\n}\n```","closed_by":{"login":"mkouba","id":913004,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkxMzAwNA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/913004?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkouba","html_url":"https://github.com/mkouba","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkouba/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkouba/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkouba/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkouba/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkouba/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkouba/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkouba/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkouba/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkouba/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/quarkusio/quarkus/issues/50618/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/quarkusio/quarkus/issues/50618/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
