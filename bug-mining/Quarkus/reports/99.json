The previous version (2.3.230) seems to be unaffected so far. Quarkus 3.14/3.15 LTS is using the affected 2.3.232 version.\r\n\r\nFor details, see:\r\n* https://github.com/keycloak/keycloak/issues/32785\r\n* https://github.com/h2database/h2database/issues/4123\r\n\r\nThis issue is to track this on the Quarkus side. Depending on how quickly there will be fix and a release of H2, it might be good to consider temporarily downgrading H2 in Quarkus.\n\n### Expected behavior\n\n_No response_\n\n### Actual behavior\n\n_No response_\n\n### How to Reproduce?\n\n_No response_\n\n### Output of `uname -a` or `ver`\n\n_No response_\n\n### Output of `java -version`\n\n_No response_\n\n### Quarkus version or git rev\n\n_No response_\n\n### Build tool (ie. output of `mvnw --version` or `gradlew --version`)\n\n_No response_\n\n### Additional information\n\n_No response_","closed_by":{"login":"gastaldi","id":54133,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0MTMz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/54133?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gastaldi","html_url":"https://github.com/gastaldi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gastaldi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gastaldi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gastaldi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gastaldi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gastaldi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gastaldi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gastaldi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gastaldi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gastaldi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/quarkusio/quarkus/issues/43261/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/quarkusio/quarkus/issues/43261/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
