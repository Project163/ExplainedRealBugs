The implementation is already set up to inherit defaults from the implementation so we should use that instead.","closed_by":{"login":"gastaldi","id":54133,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0MTMz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/54133?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gastaldi","html_url":"https://github.com/gastaldi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gastaldi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gastaldi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gastaldi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gastaldi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gastaldi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gastaldi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gastaldi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gastaldi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gastaldi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/quarkusio/quarkus/issues/43474/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/quarkusio/quarkus/issues/43474/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
