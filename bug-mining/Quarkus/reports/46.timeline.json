I wonder if when we fully rerun the tests, we should actually clear the status but I'm not entirely sure, that's what you wanted?\r\nThe reproducer here is quite useful: https://github.com/flyinfish/quarkus--continuous-testing-dotenv . Run dev mode, then uncomment the filters in `src/main/resources/application.properties` and you should see the problem.\r\n\r\n@radcortez at some point, we should probably think of a way to achieve this in a fully supported manner as this thing is quite brittle :).

though.\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/quarkusio/quarkus/issues/41317/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/quarkusio/quarkus/issues/41317/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/quarkusio/quarkus/issues/comments/2179214202","html_url":"https://github.com/quarkusio/quarkus/issues/41282#issuecomment-2179214202","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/quarkusio/quarkus/issues/41282","id":2179214202,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCFbutM6B5Ct6","user":{"login":"gsmet","id":1279749,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNzk3NDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1279749?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gsmet","html_url":"https://github.com/gsmet","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gsmet/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gsmet/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gsmet/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gsmet/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gsmet/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gsmet/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gsmet/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gsmet/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gsmet/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-06-19T17:28:32Z","updated_at":"2024-06-19T17:28:32Z","body":"I
