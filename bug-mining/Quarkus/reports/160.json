Describe the bug\n\nWhen creating a `Client` from a `ClientBuilder`, the `Configuration` [is passed](https://github.com/quarkusio/quarkus/blob/18c4016ed188330e62208d6698f87da8dfedfe0a/independent-projects/resteasy-reactive/client/runtime/src/main/java/org/jboss/resteasy/reactive/client/impl/ClientBuilderImpl.java#L289) to the resulting `Client` instead of copied, so all properties and providers registered on the client are visible to the builder and all other clients build from it.\n\nFor comparison, when going from a `Client` to a `WebTarget`, the `Configuration` [is copied](https://github.com/quarkusio/quarkus/blob/18c4016ed188330e62208d6698f87da8dfedfe0a/independent-projects/resteasy-reactive/client/runtime/src/main/java/org/jboss/resteasy/reactive/client/impl/ClientImpl.java#L275).\n\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nEach `Client` should receive a copy of the `Configuration` of the `ClientBuilder`.\n\n### Actual behavior\n\nThe `Client` and `ClientBuilder` share the same `Configuration` instance.\n\n### How to Reproduce?\n\nReproducer: https://github.com/Sola-ris/quarkus-configuration-reporducer\n\nRun via `./mvnw verify`\n\n\n### Output of `uname -a` or `ver`\n\nLinux xxx 5.15.167.4-microsoft-standard-WSL2 #1 SMP Tue Nov 5 00:21:55 UTC 2024 x86_64 GNU/Linux\n\n### Output of `java -version`\n\nopenjdk version \"21.0.5\" 2024-10-15 LTS OpenJDK Runtime Environment Temurin-21.0.5+11 (build 21.0.5+11-LTS) OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM Temurin-21.0.5+11 (build 21.0.5+11-LTS, mixed mode, sharing)\n\n### Quarkus version or git rev\n\n3.17.6\n\n### Build tool (ie. output of `mvnw --version` or `gradlew --version`)\n\nApache Maven 3.9.9 (8e8579a9e76f7d015ee5ec7bfcdc97d260186937)\n\n### Additional information\n\nWhen replacing the reproducer's dependencies with their RESTEasy Classic versions, the test passes.","closed_by":{"login":"geoand","id":4374975,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzNzQ5NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4374975?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/geoand","html_url":"https://github.com/geoand","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geoand/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geoand/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geoand/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geoand/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geoand/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geoand/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geoand/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geoand/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geoand/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/quarkusio/quarkus/issues/45555/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/quarkusio/quarkus/issues/45555/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
