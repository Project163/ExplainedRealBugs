As a result, the default locale won't be included by default in the native image unless explicitly specified and it will also not be set implicitly.\r\n\r\nAs discussed in https://github.com/quarkusio/quarkus/discussions/43533#discussioncomment-10797019 this PR updates the locales support so that:\r\n\r\n- [x] if neither `quarkus.locales` nor `quarkus.default-locale` is set, the Quarkus applications should default to English (`en_US`), instead of the build systems locale (which is the current behavior), at run-time.\r\n- [X] if `quarkus.default-locale` is set but `quarkus.locales` is not set, then we should only include the locale `quarkus.default-locale` is set to. This is the current behavior with GraalVM for JDK 21.\r\n- [X] if both `quarkus.default-locale` and `quarkus.locales` are set, then we should include only the locales from `quarkus.locales` and the one from `quarkus.default-locale` (this is the current behavior).\r\n- [X] if `quarkus.locales` is set but `quarkus.default-locale` is not set, then we should include only the locales from

The fonts detection and fonts loading is such a place. We reflected this change in Mandrel test suite https://github.com/Karm/mandrel-integration-tests/pull/277, but it is finding its way to Quarkus only now with this PR.\r\n\r\nSee GraalVM notes on the support of this API in Native-image: [foreign-interface](https://www.graalvm.org/latest/reference-manual/native-image/native-code-interoperability/foreign-interface/)\r\n\r\nI tested this PR with latest JDK 24 based Mandrel dev build `Mandrel-24.2.0-dev59c335af5b8 (build 24-beta+20-ea)`\r\nand the current GA `Mandrel-24.1.1.0-Final (build 23.0.1+11)`.\r\n\r\n## Question:\r\nDo we enable the API unconditionally for JDK 24+ based native-image? Or do we detect AWT extension usage? Which other use cases might trigger this in the JDK code?\r\n\r\n## Explanation of the debug \r\n...for posterity.\r\n\r\nThe error message is cryptic for information leakage reasons as discussed on https://github.com/openjdk/jdk/pull/20169#issuecomment-2381602619. \r\n\r\n```\r\nCaused by: java.io.IOException: Problem reading font data.\r\n\tat java.desktop@24-beta/java.awt.Font.createFont0(Font.java:1205)\r\n\tat java.desktop@24-beta/java.awt.Font.createFont(Font.java:1076)\r\n\tat io.quarkus.awt.it.Application.init(Application.java:63)\r\n\tat io.quarkus.awt.it.Application_Bean.doCreate(Unknown Source)\r\n\t... 26 more\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo the root cause became apparent to me during a `gdb` session:\r\n\r\n```\r\n(gdb) p *(t->cause->detailMessage->value)\r\n$1054 = {<byte []> = {<java.lang.Object> = {<_objhdr> = {\r\n        hub = 0xe093b8

\r\n```\r\n\r\n...and only then I recalled the old

Doesn't it make the test merely build the native executable and then just don't run it? It seems like it to me locally.
