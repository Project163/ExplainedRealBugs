One problem we having is that the @PostConstruct method is not being called at all but the instance is put into service in an incomplete state as the @PostConstruct method is never called.  Did something change in Quarkus regarding how/when @PostConstruct works?\n\nNote this seems to be the case for several beans we have configured for early startup e.g. \n\n`\n@Unremovable\n@Singleton\n@Startup(1)\n`\nAnd in one case the class implements CredentialsProvider.\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nThe @PostConstruct method should be called after injection is complete and before any methods are called.\n\n### Actual behavior\n\nThe @PostConstruct method never gets called.\n\n### How to Reproduce?\n\n_No response_\n\n### Output of `uname -a` or `ver`\n\n_No response_\n\n### Output of `java -version`\n\njava 21.0.4 2024-07-16 LTS\n\n### Quarkus version or git rev\n\n_No response_\n\n### Build tool (ie. output of `mvnw --version` or `gradlew --version`)\n\nApache Maven 3.9.6 (bc0240f3c744dd6b6ec2920b3cd08dcc295161ae)\n\n### Additional information\n\nOS name: \"windows 11\", version: \"10.0\", arch: \"amd64\", family: \"windows\"\n","closed_by":{"login":"mkouba","id":913004,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkxMzAwNA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/913004?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkouba","html_url":"https://github.com/mkouba","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkouba/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkouba/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkouba/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkouba/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkouba/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkouba/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkouba/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkouba/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkouba/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/quarkusio/quarkus/issues/43751/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/quarkusio/quarkus/issues/43751/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
