Description\n\nUser may want to use the default Java truststore that is usually available under `$JAVA_HOME/lib/security/jssecacerts`, `$JAVA_HOME/lib/security/cacerts` or overridden throw `javax.net.ssl.trustStore` system property.\n\nTo make this use case easier, we should introduce a reserved `javax.net.ssl` TLS configuration name with the following properties: \n\n* Users can use `javax.net.ssl` as a value for various `*.tls-configuration-name` options, such as `quarkus.http.tls-configuration-name`\n* Users do not need to define that named TLS config by themselves\n* A TLS configuration with name `javax.net.ssl` would be created on demand by the TLS registry extension\n","closed_by":{"login":"cescoffier","id":402301,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwMjMwMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/402301?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cescoffier","html_url":"https://github.com/cescoffier","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cescoffier/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cescoffier/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cescoffier/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cescoffier/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cescoffier/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cescoffier/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cescoffier/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cescoffier/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cescoffier/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/quarkusio/quarkus/issues/45175/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/quarkusio/quarkus/issues/45175/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
