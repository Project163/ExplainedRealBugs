Describe the bug\n\nI upgraded my app to the latest Quarkus version and i got the following error (it used to work)\n\njava.lang.IllegalArgumentException: Namespace [global] may not be handled by multiple resolvers of the same priority [-999]: io.quarkiverse.renarde.util.Globals_Globals@56d489bd and gr.admin.qute.MyGlobal_Globals@45bbbc71\n\nIn my project i defined a class with @TemplateGlobal which has a dependency to Renarde which has it's own @TemplateGlobal class.\n\nIt might be related to https://github.com/quarkusio/quarkus/pull/45771\n\nWhen you start the app with `mvn quarkus:dev` it works as expected, but if you change something and trigger the live reload it will throw the error. \n\nAlso, i tried a prod build and the error did not occur.\n\n[Reproducer](https://github.com/gbourant/global-template-bug)","closed_by":{"login":"mkouba","id":913004,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkxMzAwNA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/913004?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkouba","html_url":"https://github.com/mkouba","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkouba/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkouba/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkouba/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkouba/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkouba/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkouba/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkouba/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkouba/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkouba/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/quarkusio/quarkus/issues/46005/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/quarkusio/quarkus/issues/46005/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
