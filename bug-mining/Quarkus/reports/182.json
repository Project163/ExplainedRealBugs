While it works as expected in JVM mode, it does not work in native mode. This is because the lookup of the default `cacerts` trust store file relies on `java.home` system property, which is not set at native image runtime. There is no home directory of JRE for native executables and therefore there is also no `cacerts` file.\n\nWhen `javax.net.ssl` is used in native mode, the following exception is thrown: \n\n```\nCaused by: java.lang.IllegalStateException: Could not locate the default Java truststore because the 'java.home' property is not set\n\tat io.quarkus.tls.runtime.JavaNetSslTlsBucketConfig.defaultTrustStorePath(JavaNetSslTlsBucketConfig.java:89)\n\tat io.quarkus.tls.runtime.JavaNetSslTlsBucketConfig.trustStore(JavaNetSslTlsBucketConfig.java:48)\n\tat io.quarkus.tls.runtime.CertificateRecorder.getTrustStore(CertificateRecorder.java:153)\n\tat io.quarkus.tls.runtime.CertificateRecorder.verifyCertificateConfigInternal(CertificateRecorder.java:117)\n\tat io.quarkus.tls.runtime.CertificateRecorder.lambda$get$0(CertificateRecorder.java:179)\n\tat java.base@21.0.6/java.util.concurrent.ConcurrentHashMap.computeIfAbsent(ConcurrentHashMap.java:1708)\n...\n```\n\n## Related information\n\nGraalVM seems not not to be embedding the `cacerts` in the native executables by design - https://www.graalvm.org/latest/reference-manual/native-image/dynamic-features/CertificateManagement/ \nHere is what it does:\n\n> During the image building process, the native-image builder captures the host environment’s default TrustStore and embeds it into the native executable.\n\n\n## Possible solution\n\nThere seems to be a programmatic way to access the certs from the default trust store via\n\n```\n        TrustManagerFactory tms = TrustManagerFactory.getInstance(TrustManagerFactory.getDefaultAlgorithm());\n        tms.init((KeyStore) null);\n        for (TrustManager tm : tms.getTrustManagers()) {\n            Log.infof(\" tm = %s\", tm);\n            for (X509Certificate c : ((X509TrustManager) tm).getAcceptedIssuers()) {\n                Log.infof(\" c = %s\", c);\n            }\n        }\n```\n\nI'd try to make `io.quarkus.tls.runtime.CertificateRecorder` use those certs for `javax.net.ssl` unless somebody has a better idea?\n\n","closed_by":{"login":"gsmet","id":1279749,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNzk3NDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1279749?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gsmet","html_url":"https://github.com/gsmet","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gsmet/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gsmet/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gsmet/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gsmet/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gsmet/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gsmet/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gsmet/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gsmet/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gsmet/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/quarkusio/quarkus/issues/46368/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/quarkusio/quarkus/issues/46368/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
