in particular cb63fb601fa4a0b0644c66ed198240ac9accee72 has introduced the usage of stream(s) in the hot path of handling HTTP requests, see \n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/952ab79e-96da-4bc5-ac25-b3bae97caf15)\n\nwhich is quite costly for public benchmarks like Techempower, see in violet the global effect\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/262fd6b0-82b8-48e2-8567-cf2e1f54f75b)\n\nStream(s) are not as optimized as many believe and we should avoid using them in the hot path unless perfectly sure of the effects 🙏 \n\nSimilarly - having too many allocations there is not great - in case the \"fix\" will be to just create a new copy of the output list.","closed_by":{"login":"geoand","id":4374975,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzNzQ5NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4374975?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/geoand","html_url":"https://github.com/geoand","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geoand/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geoand/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geoand/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geoand/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geoand/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geoand/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geoand/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geoand/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geoand/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/quarkusio/quarkus/issues/46949/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/quarkusio/quarkus/issues/46949/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
