Describe the bug\n\nWhen I have message accepting a single enum parameter as part of my message bundle, a maven quarkus application fails while doing `mvn install` with the following message \n\n    Cannot invoke \"org.jboss.jandex.MethodInfo.name()\" because the return value of \"io.quarkus.qute.deployment.MessageBundleMethodBuildItem.getMethod()\" is null.\n\nThis is probably because `MessageBundleProcessor#generateExamplePropertiesFiles()` is trying to generate example properties keys by using the build item method names, and build items generated by `generateEnumConstantMessageMethod()` creates build items without methods.\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nMessage bundle processor correctly generates example properties file even when auto-generated message keys for enums are present.\n\n### Actual behavior\n\nMessage bundle processor crashes when encountering auto-generated enum messages.\n\n### How to Reproduce?\n\nCreate a qute project with the following files:\n`FooMessages.java`\n```java\n@MessageBundle(\"foo\")\npublic interface FooMessages {\n    @Message\n    String enum_message(MyEnum period);\n}\n``` \n\n`MyEnum.java`\n\n```java\npublic enum MyEnum {\n    A,\n}\n``` \n\n`/resources/messages/foo_en_US.properties`\n\n```\nenum_message_A=A\n```\n\nRun `mvn install` to build and package. Crashes with the above mentioned error message.\n\n### Output of `uname -a` or `ver`\n\n_No response_\n\n### Output of `java -version`\n\nOpenJDK Temurin 17.0.12\n\n### Quarkus version or git rev\n\n3.16.1\n\n### Build tool (ie. output of `mvnw --version` or `gradlew --version`)\n\nMaven 3.8.7\n\n### Additional information\n\n_No response_","closed_by":{"login":"mkouba","id":913004,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkxMzAwNA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/913004?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkouba","html_url":"https://github.com/mkouba","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkouba/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkouba/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkouba/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkouba/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkouba/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkouba/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkouba/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkouba/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkouba/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/quarkusio/quarkus/issues/44366/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/quarkusio/quarkus/issues/44366/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
