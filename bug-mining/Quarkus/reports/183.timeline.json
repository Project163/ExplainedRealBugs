have a couple of options but I'd like to keep the naming consistent. One of the reason is that user tags are _isolated_ by default (cannot reference the data from the parent context) but fragments are not. So we should name those parts \"fragments\" but make it easier to use.\n\nI think that we should add a fragment namespace resolver so that it's possible to use a fragment in an expression, e.g. `{frg:faClass}`; this would allow thins like `{frg:faClass.strip}` or `{#let preview=frg:faClass.substring(0,10)}`. The downside of this approach is that you can't use additional params. We could try to add something later.\n\nIt should be also easier to define a hidden fragment too. `{#fragment id=faClass rendered=false}` can be shortened to `{#fragment faClass rendered=false}` but I think that we can follow the syntax of `{#include}` and add the `_hidden` flag, i.e. `{#fragment faClass _hidden}`. Alternatively, we could add an alias like `hidd_fragment` -> `{#hidd_fragment faClass}`.","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/quarkusio/quarkus/issues/comments/2670663956/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"mkouba","id":913004,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkxMzAwNA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/913004?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkouba","html_url":"https://github.com/mkouba","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkouba/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkouba/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkouba/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkouba/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkouba/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkouba/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkouba/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkouba/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkouba/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/quarkusio/quarkus/issues/comments/2670820073","html_url":"https://github.com/quarkusio/quarkus/issues/46355#issuecomment-2670820073","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/quarkusio/quarkus/issues/46355","id":2670820073,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCFbutM6fMXrp","user":{"login":"ia3andy","id":2223984,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyMjM5ODQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2223984?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ia3andy","html_url":"https://github.com/ia3andy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ia3andy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ia3andy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ia3andy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ia3andy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ia3andy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ia3andy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ia3andy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ia3andy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ia3andy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-02-20T08:44:21Z","updated_at":"2025-02-20T08:44:21Z","body":"That's sounds very good, I would just use `{#capture}` as the name that means `{#fragment hidden=true}`.\n\nHaving a shortcut to avoid having to specify the `id` would be great like you suggested `{#capture foo} = {#capture id=foo}`.\n\nFor consumption having a namespace is perfect as it solve the coping issue.
