After migrating to Quarkus Operator SDK v7, I observed that I'm not able to run a shared dev service accross multiple integration anymore which worked nicely before.\n\nMy properties look as follows:\n```\nquarkus.kubernetes-client.devservices.enabled=true\nquarkus.kubernetes-client.devservices.flavor=k3s\nquarkus.kubernetes-client.devservices.override-kubeconfig=true\nquarkus.kubernetes-client.devservices.shared=true\n```\n\nAfter further debugging, I noticed that this boolean https://github.com/quarkusio/quarkus/blob/main/extensions/kubernetes-client/deployment/src/main/java/io/quarkus/kubernetes/client/deployment/DevServicesKubernetesProcessor.java#L114 is always true in my tests which leads to the cluster being shutdown.\n\nAfter noticing this, I looked at the equals method https://github.com/quarkusio/quarkus/blob/main/extensions/kubernetes-client/deployment/src/main/java/io/quarkus/kubernetes/client/deployment/DevServicesKubernetesProcessor.java#L429 and noticed that there is a check `flavor == other.flavor` even though flavor is an Optional. For all other Optionals the equals method uses `Objects.equals(...)`, so I assume `Objects.equals(flavor, other.flavor)` would be required here as well so that the equals method works properly.\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nWhen configuring a shared Kubernetes Dev Service, it should not be immediately shutdown after the first test case but only after all test case were executed.\n\n### Actual behavior\n\nWhen executing multiple tests at once the Kubernetes Dev Service is shutdown after the first test immediately.\n\n### How to Reproduce?\n\nConfigure a Quarkus Kubernetes Dev Service in the same way as I did, run the application in the debugger and add a breakpoint here: https://github.com/quarkusio/quarkus/blob/main/extensions/kubernetes-client/deployment/src/main/java/io/quarkus/kubernetes/client/deployment/DevServicesKubernetesProcessor.java#L114 - `shouldShutdownTheCluster` will always be true.\n\n### Output of `uname -a` or `ver`\n\nDarwin 24.6.0 Darwin Kernel Version 24.6.0: Mon Jul 14 11:30:30 PDT 2025; root:xnu-11417.140.69~1/RELEASE_ARM64_T6020 arm64\n\n### Output of `java -version`\n\nopenjdk 24.0.1 2025-04-15\n\n### Quarkus version or git rev\n\n3.25.1\n\n### Build tool (ie. output of `mvnw --version` or `gradlew --version`)\n\nGradle 8.14.2\n\n### Additional information\n\nMy Quarkus Kubernetes operators are written in Kotlin.","closed_by":{"login":"gsmet","id":1279749,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNzk3NDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1279749?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gsmet","html_url":"https://github.com/gsmet","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gsmet/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gsmet/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gsmet/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gsmet/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gsmet/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gsmet/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gsmet/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gsmet/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gsmet/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/quarkusio/quarkus/issues/49405/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/quarkusio/quarkus/issues/49405/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
