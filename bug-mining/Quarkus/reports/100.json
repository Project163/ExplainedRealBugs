Describe the bug\n\nPulsar devservice is not starting on RHEL 8 aarch64\r\n\r\nChecked through Quarkus Quickstarts by running `mvn clean verify -pl 'pulsar-quickstart/pulsar-quickstart-producer'`\r\n\r\nI was able to capture some logs from the container / devservice initialization procedure through `docker ps -a | grep pulsar` and `docker container logs $CONTAINER_ID --follow`.\r\n\r\nHere is the log: [pulsar.txt](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/16946424/pulsar.txt)\r\n\r\nThe main failure is at the end of file\r\n```\r\n#\r\n# A fatal error has been detected by the Java Runtime Environment:\r\n#\r\n#  SIGSEGV (0xb) at pc=0x0000ffffae613ef8, pid=10, tid=270\r\n#\r\n# JRE version: OpenJDK Runtime Environment Corretto-21.0.4.7.1 (21.0.4+7) (build 21.0.4+7-LTS)\r\n# Java VM: OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM Corretto-21.0.4.7.1 (21.0.4+7-LTS, mixed mode, tiered, compressed class ptrs, z gc, linux-aarch64)\r\n```\r\n\r\nSeems the container is using internally Corretto JDK and it face some issues on RHEL 8.10 machine\r\n\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nPulsar devservice starts well on RHEL 8 aarch64\n\n### Actual behavior\n\nPulsar devservice is not starting on RHEL 8 aarch64\n\n### How to Reproduce?\n\n - get Quarkus Quickstarts https://github.com/quarkusio/quarkus-quickstarts\r\n - run
