Description\r\n\r\nIt'll nice to have the same behavior for Json template for character escapes like the one we have for XML content explained here [https://quarkus.io/guides/qute-reference#character-escapes](https://quarkus.io/guides/qute-reference#character-escapes) allowing users to escape content we want to include, for example, as string in an attribute value, for those values that contain quotes, new line, ... characters.\r\nDespite there is a workaround by creating a @TemplateExtension or @TemplateData to access encode static functions available in Apache Commons Texts and others, but I think this must be a core functionality.\r\n\r\n### Implementation ideas\r\n\r\nUse the same approach for escaping XML content, may be including in quarkus.qute.escape-content-types property \"application/json\" joined to the characters escape policy.\r\nOther easy approach will be include in \"Built-in Template Extensions\" one for Strings, allowing encoding and unencoding options.","closed_by":{"login":"mkouba","id":913004,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkxMzAwNA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/913004?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkouba","html_url":"https://github.com/mkouba","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkouba/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkouba/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkouba/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkouba/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkouba/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkouba/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkouba/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkouba/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mkouba/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/quarkusio/quarkus/issues/43369/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/quarkusio/quarkus/issues/43369/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
