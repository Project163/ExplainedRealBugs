I also see that this is not a Quarkus problem. However, there is probably nothing Jacoco can do about it either, e.g. https://github.com/jacoco/jacoco/issues/1653. \n\nThere is also a bug report in the AWS SDK https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-java-v2/issues/6234.\nThe workaround is usually to exclude the class from Jacoco by configuration\n\nHowever, this is currently not possible in the JacocoProcessor.\nhttps://github.com/quarkusio/quarkus/blob/0404a0c41f14a05abf3ce82d99459f8cc827717f/test-framework/jacoco/deployment/src/main/java/io/quarkus/jacoco/deployment/JacocoProcessor.java#L80\n\n

have a few questions here:\n- should we catch a `ClassTooLargeException` and just not instrument the class in this case? And log a warning.\n- I'm surprised we instrument all the classes of all the libraries. I would have expected we would measure the coverage of only the application classes? But I'm probably missing something?\n\nBTW, these questions don't prevent us from adding a way to ignore a class (or maybe even an entire archive).","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/quarkusio/quarkus/issues/comments/3142831455/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"gsmet","id":1279749,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNzk3NDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1279749?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gsmet","html_url":"https://github.com/gsmet","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gsmet/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gsmet/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gsmet/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gsmet/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gsmet/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gsmet/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gsmet/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gsmet/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gsmet/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/quarkusio/quarkus/issues/comments/3145164041","html_url":"https://github.com/quarkusio/quarkus/issues/49238#issuecomment-3145164041","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/quarkusio/quarkus/issues/49238","id":3145164041,"node_id":"IC_kwDOCFbutM67d2UJ","user":{"login":"gsmet","id":1279749,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNzk3NDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1279749?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gsmet","html_url":"https://github.com/gsmet","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gsmet/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gsmet/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gsmet/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gsmet/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gsmet/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gsmet/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gsmet/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gsmet/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gsmet/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-08-01T16:43:11Z","updated_at":"2025-08-01T16:43:11Z","body":"> I'm surprised we instrument all the classes of all the libraries.

@gsmet \n\nI tried your fix with a project with submodules. The project follows a hexagonal architecture and is modelled the following way.\n\n```\nproject root\n|\n| - application core with only a few dependencies\n| - AWS & Quarkus stuff, API client for external services, etc.\n| - integration tests\n| - AWS lambdas domain A\n| - AWS lambdas domain B\n| - AWS lambdas domain C\n...\n```\n\nTest coverage has fallen from around 85% to 60%. The decrease in coverage seems to be due to the fact that most classes in the `AWS & Quarkus stuff, API client for external services, etc` module are tested in the `integration tests` module and not in the module itself. \n\nWhen looking at the Jacoco project, I noticed in particular that the coverage there has fallen sharply, often even to 0%. This could probably be due to the fact that the classes from the other module are no longer taken into account.\n\nWould it even be possible to distinguish between classes from the application itself and external libraries in such a project structure?\n\nI then tried a \"brute force\" approach and changed the affected lines to.\n\n```\n    try {\n        byte[] enhanced = instrumenter.instrument(bytes, className);\n        if (enhanced == null) {\n            return bytes;\n        }\n        return enhanced;\n    } catch (IOException e) {\n        LOG.warnf(e,\n            \"Unable to instrument class %s with Jacoco, keeping the original class\",\n            className);\n        return bytes;\n    }\n```\n\nThe build was successful and the coverage was also at the same level as before. Of course, this is not a “nice” approach, but at least the build is not blocked and the coverage is calculated correctly.","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/quarkusio/quarkus/issues/comments/3153732605/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"dagrammy","id":14089875,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MDg5ODc1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14089875?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dagrammy","html_url":"https://github.com/dagrammy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dagrammy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dagrammy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dagrammy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dagrammy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dagrammy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dagrammy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dagrammy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dagrammy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dagrammy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}}]
