Description\n\nI'd like to propose that `quarkus-bom-test` stops importing `io.quarkus:quarkus-bom` for the following reason: \n\nIf third party vendors of Quarkus extensions want to test their extensions against Platform BOMs, then they may end up with outdated Quarkus artiafcts depending on ordering of their BOM imports. \nNamely, if they import `quarkus-bom-test` before a possibly newer Platform BOM, then possibly outdated Quarkus artifacts managed via `quarkus-bom-test` may get a higher precedence than the ones managed in Platform BOMs.\n\nIn case the third party vendor aims at testing with downstream Quarkus artifacts, then `quarkus-bom-test` may break their assumptions by bringing community artifacts instead.\n\n### Implementation ideas\n\nThe change in `quarkus-bom-test` is trivial.","closed_by":{"login":"aloubyansky","id":323379,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyMzM3OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/323379?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aloubyansky","html_url":"https://github.com/aloubyansky","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aloubyansky/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aloubyansky/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aloubyansky/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aloubyansky/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aloubyansky/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aloubyansky/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aloubyansky/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aloubyansky/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aloubyansky/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/quarkusio/quarkus/issues/48308/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/quarkusio/quarkus/issues/48308/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
