part of https://openrdf.atlassian.net/browse/SES-2188 the hashCode implementations of both `LiteralImpl` ( = `SimpleLiteral`) and `QueryBindingSet` were strenghtened, in the former case to include language tag and datatype. This change was part of Sesame 2.8, 2.9 and Sesame 4, but somehow this change was regressed when we migrated the code base to rdf4j. \r\n\r\nThis is a critical bug for database implementations that rely on value hashcodes for internal storage/serialization. \r\n\r\nThe necessary changes can be seen here:\r\n\r\nhttps://bitbucket.org/openrdf/sesame/commits/3774e2b56563a2297320618fdf477597e5b627a4\r\n\r\n@nikolavp ","closed_by":{"login":"abrokenjester","id":728776,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcyODc3Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/728776?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/abrokenjester","html_url":"https://github.com/abrokenjester","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abrokenjester/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abrokenjester/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abrokenjester/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abrokenjester/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abrokenjester/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abrokenjester/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abrokenjester/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abrokenjester/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abrokenjester/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-rdf4j/rdf4j/issues/649/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-rdf4j/rdf4j/issues/649/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
