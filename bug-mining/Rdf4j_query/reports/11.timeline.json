PR addresses GitHub issue: #732 .\r\n\r\nBriefly describe the changes proposed in this PR:\r\n\r\n* Add japicmp maven plugin to core modules to start gathering knowledge about the scope of our likely public API for #619\r\n* Reenables animal sniffer with the java-8 signatures. This will be useful with Java-9 betas being used more regularly for experimentation.\r\n* Removes some unused managed dependencies\r\n\r\nThe japicmp inclusions may not be all of the eventual public API modules, but it forms a likely base. The japicmp plugin does not yet have aggregation support, so each of the individual modules that will make up the public API need to have the plugin added to them manually.\r\n\r\nNotably, none of the rio or queryresultio modules need to be in the public API IMO, as they are all accessible as services by all of our core APIs solely using rio-api and queryresultio-api.\r\n\r\nSigned-off-by: Peter Ansell <p_ansell@yahoo.com>","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-rdf4j/rdf4j/issues/733/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-rdf4j/rdf4j/issues/733/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-rdf4j/rdf4j/issues/comments/273667676","html_url":"https://github.com/eclipse-rdf4j/rdf4j/issues/732#issuecomment-273667676","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-rdf4j/rdf4j/issues/732","id":273667676,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI3MzY2NzY3Ng==","user":{"login":"abrokenjester","id":728776,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcyODc3Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/728776?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/abrokenjester","html_url":"https://github.com/abrokenjester","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abrokenjester/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abrokenjester/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abrokenjester/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abrokenjester/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abrokenjester/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abrokenjester/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abrokenjester/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abrokenjester/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abrokenjester/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-01-19T02:49:00Z","updated_at":"2017-01-19T02:49:58Z","body":"Sounds good.

They are generated on build into the target/japicmp/ directory as HTML files. The files are basically empty if no interfaces have changed, and populated with all of the relevant classes/methods/fields if any were added/removed/changed.\r\n\r\nThe reports differentiate between source and binary compatible. \"Binary incompatible changes are marked with (!) while source incompatible changes are marked with (*).\" I don't think we expect our code to be binary compatible (based on past behaviour), but we do want it to be source compatible as far as practical.\r\n\r\nThe default is also to look at protected/public, which I think is relevant for us in some cases with our Abstract implementations that we intend third-parties to reuse. We could change it to \"public-only\" but it wouldn't be as useful.\r\n\r\nWe can also customise it to only particular packages or classes, which will help for some of the embedded \"impl\" packages inside of api modules.\r\n\r\nThe code also shows up serialisation issues, which we have some of between 2.0 and 2.2-SNAPSHOT.\r\n\r\nIt is a little annoying in our large scale case that the reports are not yet aggregated to the reactor parent, but it should still be useful for us to review pull requests.\r\n\r\nIf you run \"mvn clean install -DskipTests\" on the pull request #733 code you can get a fairly quick idea of what some of the reports look like.","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-rdf4j/rdf4j/issues/comments/273671509/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"ansell","id":82365,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgyMzY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/82365?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ansell","html_url":"https://github.com/ansell","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ansell/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ansell/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ansell/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ansell/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ansell/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ansell/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ansell/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ansell/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ansell/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":929990733,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDkyOTk5MDczMw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-rdf4j/rdf4j/issues/events/929990733","actor":{"login":"abrokenjester","id":728776,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcyODc3Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/728776?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/abrokenjester","html_url":"https://github.com/abrokenjester","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abrokenjester/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abrokenjester/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abrokenjester/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abrokenjester/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abrokenjester/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abrokenjester/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abrokenjester/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abrokenjester/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abrokenjester/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"2080eb0631d415fcf56a719e651de42a4ee3f7c7","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-rdf4j/rdf4j/commits/2080eb0631d415fcf56a719e651de42a4ee3f7c7","created_at":"2017-01-19T23:54:47Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":943863988,"node_id":"MDEzOkFzc2lnbmVkRXZlbnQ5NDM4NjM5ODg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-rdf4j/rdf4j/issues/events/943863988","actor":{"login":"abrokenjester","id":728776,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcyODc3Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/728776?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/abrokenjester","html_url":"https://github.com/abrokenjester","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abrokenjester/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abrokenjester/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abrokenjester/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abrokenjester/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abrokenjester/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abrokenjester/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abrokenjester/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abrokenjester/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abrokenjester/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"assigned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2017-01-31T21:56:40Z","assignee":{"login":"ansell","id":82365,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgyMzY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/82365?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ansell","html_url":"https://github.com/ansell","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ansell/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ansell/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ansell/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ansell/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ansell/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ansell/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ansell/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ansell/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ansell/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":943864247,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50OTQzODY0MjQ3","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/eclipse-rdf4j/rdf4j/issues/events/943864247","actor":{"login":"abrokenjester","id":728776,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcyOD
