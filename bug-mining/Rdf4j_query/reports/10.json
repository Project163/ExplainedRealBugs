2.0.2 hashCode() and equals() were consistent for AbstractBindingSet (and thus all of its descendants) but in 2.0.3 hashCode() suddenly began to be sensitive to the order bindings are added, while equals() stayed agnostic to the order. As this is a Set I believe both hashCode() and equals() shouldn't care about the order and it's a good idea to keep them consistent either way.\r\n\r\nThis change was introduced by https://github.com/eclipse/rdf4j/pull/650.
