+Stability Policy
+----------------
+
+The following policy applies for the *Black* code style, in non pre-release
+versions of *Black*:
+
+- The same code, formatted with the same options, will produce the same
+  output for all releases in a given calendar year.
+
+  This means projects can safely use `black ~= 22.0` without worrying about
+  major formatting changes disrupting their project in 2022. We may still
+  fix bugs where *Black* crashes on some code, and make other improvements
+  that do not affect formatting.
+
+- The first release in a new calendar year *may* contain formatting changes,
+  although these will be minimised as much as possible. This is to allow for
+  improved formatting enabled by newer Python language syntax as well as due
+  to improvements in the formatting logic.
+
+- The ``--future`` flag is exempt from this policy. There are no guarentees
+  around the stability of the output with that flag passed into *Black*. This
+  flag is intended for allowing experimentation with the proposed changes to
+  the *Black* code style.
 
 Documentation for both the current and future styles can be found:
