To confirm this, you have three options:\r\n\r\n1. Update Black's version if a newer release exists: `pip install -U black`\r\n2. Use the online formatter at <https://black.vercel.app/?version=main>, which will use\r\n   the latest main branch.\r\n3. Or run _Black_ on your machine:\r\n   - create a new virtualenv (make sure it's the same Python version);\r\n   - clone this repository;\r\n   - run `pip install -e .[d]`;\r\n   - run `pip install -r test_requirements.txt`\r\n   - make sure it's sane by running `python -m pytest`; and\r\n   - run `black` like you did last time.\r\n-->\r\nDisclaimer: I was hesitant whether I should report this as a bug or rather a \"Feature request\".\r\n\r\n**Describe the bug**\r\n\r\n<!-- A clear and concise description of what the bug is. -->\r\nIn a project dealing with multiple sub-projects in a single repository (aka. mono-repo style) having more than one `pyproject.toml` file confuses black.\r\nIn our example we wanted to have one top-level black configuration,\r\nwhile also having sub-project specific `pyproject.toml` files (without any black config) in each sub-directory.\r\nUnfortunately, running black on a sub-directory\r\nuses default configuration instead of the one defined in the top-level config file.\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nMinimal steps to reproduce the behavior with source code and Black's configuration.\r\n-->\r\nGiven this file structure:\r\n```\r\n.\r\n|-- pyproject.toml\r\n|-- sub1\r\n|   |-- pyproject.toml\r\n|   `-- test.py\r\n`-- sub2\r\n    `-- test.py\r\n```\r\n\r\nWith the following contents:\r\n```\r\n==> ./pyproject.toml <==\r\n[tool.black]\r\nline-length = 20\r\n\r\n==> ./sub1/pyproject.toml <==\r\n[tool.isort]\r\nprofile = \"black\"\r\n\r\n==> ./sub1/test.py <==\r\na_very_long_line = {\"that should be wrapped\": \"to fit 20 characters line length\"}\r\n\r\n==> ./sub2/test.py <==\r\na_very_long_line = {\"that should be wrapped\": \"to fit 20 characters line length\"}\r\n```\r\n\r\nRunning black on both test.py files:\r\n```sh\r\n$ black -v sub1/test.py\r\nIdentified `/private/tmp/black-many-configs/sub1` as project root containing a pyproject.toml.\r\nSources to be formatted: \"test.py\"\r\nsub1/test.py already well formatted, good job.\r\n\r\nAll done! ✨ 🍰 ✨\r\n1 file left unchanged.\r\n\r\n$ black -v sub2/test.py\r\nIdentified `/private/tmp/black-many-configs` as project root containing a pyproject.toml.\r\nSources to be formatted: \"sub2/test.py\"\r\nUsing configuration from project root.\r\nreformatted sub2/test.py\r\n\r\nAll done! ✨ 🍰 ✨\r\n1 file reformatted.\r\n```\r\n\r\nModifies only the file inside `sub2` directory (the one without `pyproject.toml` file)\r\neven though `sub1/pyproject.toml` doesn't contain any black config section.\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\n\r\n<!-- A clear and concise description of what you expected to happen. -->\r\nBoth files should be modified\r\nand black should continue looking for a file\r\nthat is relevant for its configuration (in this case, the one that has a `[tool.black]` section).\r\n\r\n**Environment**\r\n\r\n<!-- Please complete the following information: -->\r\n\r\n- Black's version: black, 22.1.0 (compiled: yes)\r\n- OS and Python version: OSX - Python 3.9.9\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\n\r\n<!-- Add any other context about the problem here. -->\r\n\r\nA variation of this problem has already been reported in https://github.com/psf/black/issues/1826, where the proposed solution is to introduce support for the `config` option inside the sub-project's `pyproject.toml` config file.\r\n\r\nOther (potentially) relevant issues: https://github.com/psf/black/issues/2537, https://github.com/psf/black/issues/2850.","closed_by":{"login":"JelleZijlstra","id":906600,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkwNjYwMA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/906600?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra","html_url":"https://github.com/JelleZijlstra","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/psf/black/issues/2863/reactions","total_count":10,"+1":10,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/psf/black/issues/2863/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
