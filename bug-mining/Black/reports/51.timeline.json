PEP-8 says this:\r\n```\r\nham[lower+offset : upper+offset]\r\n```\r\nnot what you quoted above:\r\n```\r\nham[lower + offset : upper + offset]\r\n```\r\nNotice that the original from PEP-8 does **not** have whitespace around the + operator.\r\n\r\nThe parenthesized reference to *\"as the operator with the lowest priority*\" in PEP-8 *[Pet Peeves](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/#id27)* section  is related to the following **exception** on whitespace around operators in PEP-8 that few people pay attention to.\r\n\r\n**YES**:\r\n```\r\nx = x*2 - 1\r\n````\r\n\r\n**NO**:\r\n```\r\nx = x * 2 - 1\r\n```\r\n\r\nNormally, according to PEP-8, we would write `x * 2` with the spaces around the operator, but, in this case, to make precedence rules more readable, the higher priority operator -- multiplication -- was cuddled with the operands (x and 2) and whitespace was left around the lower priority operator only -- a subtraction.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, what PEP-8 is saying about the slicing operator is that it is the \"lowest precedence\" and therefore it **has** the spaces around it, but notice that also the higher precedence addition (+) has **no** spaces around it. That is why it should be written as `ham[lower+offset : upper+offset]` and not the way it seems to be interpreted by Black.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, in the Black's README the example given as `ham[1 + 1 :]` should be really `ham[1+1 :]`. Even better, I'd change the example to something more similar to PEP-8 where this makes more sense than with a simple `1+1` because we can always write that as `2`. Also, the documentation would benefit from the clarification that Black will not change `ham[1:5]` into `ham[1 : 5]` because that would be non-compliant with PEP-8 too.","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/psf/black/issues/comments/415918358/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"zvezdan","id":2942065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5NDIwNjU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2942065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zvezdan","html_url":"https://github.com/zvezdan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zvezdan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zvezdan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zvezdan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zvezdan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zvezdan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zvezdan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zvezdan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zvezdan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zvezdan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":1808784942,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MTgwODc4NDk0Mg==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/psf/black/issues/events/1808784942","actor":{"login":"ambv","id":55281,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1Mjgx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55281?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambv","html_url":"https://github.com/ambv","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambv/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambv/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambv/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambv/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambv/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambv/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambv/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambv/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambv/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-08-25T01:04:36Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":1808784943,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDE4MDg3ODQ5NDM=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/psf/black/issues/events/1808784943","actor":{"login":"ambv","id":55281,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1Mjgx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55281?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambv","html_url":"https://github.com/ambv","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambv/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambv/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambv/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambv/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambv/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambv/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambv/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambv/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambv/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-08-25T01:04:36Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/psf/black/issues/comments/416069315","html_url":"https://github.com/psf/black/issues/157#issuecomment-416069315","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/psf/black/issues/157","id":416069315,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQxNjA2OTMxNQ==","user":{"login":"ambv","id":55281,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1Mjgx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55281?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambv","html_url":"https://github.com/ambv","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambv/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambv/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambv/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambv/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambv/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambv/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambv/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambv/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambv/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-08-26T20:28:51Z","updated_at":"2018-08-26T20:28:51Z","body":"Choosing

It's definitely in the spirit of Black.\r\n\r\nThanks for pointing out #148. When seen together with this issue, it *may* raise some questions.\r\n\r\nAccording to the answers in these two issues, one **exception** is easy to implement (space around slice operator), and the other is hard to implement (no space around highest priority math operators). Still, both are **exceptions** to standard rules: \"no space around simple slice operator\", such as `[1:5]` and \"space around math operators\", such as `1 + 2`.\r\n\r\nThe fact is that, in the math operator case, Black chooses to (over)simplify by always using the **standard** rule, at the cost of making the original math expressions unreadable. In the slice operator case, it chooses to implement the **exception**, because it's easy, at the benefit of very small readability improvement. I doubt people have too many issues with reading cuddled slice operators the way _pycodestyle_ simplifies them. Simplifying both cases seems a reasonable choice too.\r\n\r\nBy implementing this slice operator exception, Black gets a little higher percentage of PEP-8 compliance, albeit, at the price of making the *choice* between the two equally acceptable slice operator exceptions, as you point out. The first formatting of that exception, as I pointed out, satisfies **both** the math and the slice operator exceptions, providing even more of PEP-8 compliance. The reason why one exception formatting, among the two, was not chosen by Black, reveals, through issue #148, how hard it is to implement all these exceptions.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, because of that choice, Black changes `ham[lower+offset : upper+offset]` that is **already PEP-8 compliant** (mathematicians might argue that it's even *more compliant*)  into the other formatting choice, for no good reason.\r\n\r\nThus, this kind of cherry-picking the PEP-8 exceptions **may feel** arbitrary and subjective.\r\nThat, in turn, can make Black less acceptable to lots of teams and developers.\r\n\r\nPersonally, I accept the fact that Black developers already made their decisions and that this issue is closed.
