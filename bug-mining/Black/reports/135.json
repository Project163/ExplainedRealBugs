There should be 3.7 and 3.8 wheels made available as well.\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\n- See: https://pypi.org/project/black/19.10b0/#files\r\n    - Only py36 wheel is available\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nWheels should be available for py37 and py38 as well\r\n\r\n**Environment**\r\n- Version: 19.10b0\r\n- OS and Python version: Linux/Python 3.7.3\r\n\r\n**Does this bug also happen on master?**\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nVersion 18.3a1 (https://pypi.org/project/black/18.3a1/#files) has a py3 wheel, which makes it compatible with all Python3 interpreters. The move to a py36 wheel is understandable (to enforce Black's Python >= 3.6 requirement as I understand), but without additional wheels we cannot use it with Python 3.7.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"JelleZijlstra","id":906600,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkwNjYwMA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/906600?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra","html_url":"https://github.com/JelleZijlstra","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/psf/black/issues/1385/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/psf/black/issues/1385/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
