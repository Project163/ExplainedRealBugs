the bug**\r\n\r\n`no_python2` test errors on `main` while following Black's docs for contributing.\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\n\r\nPer [docs](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/contributing/the_basics.html):\r\n```\r\npipenv install --dev\r\npipenv shell\r\npre-commit install\r\npre-commit run -a\r\ntox -e py\r\n```\r\nThe above works properly, however *another* run of `tox -e py` results in an error due to tox's usage of existing `py` environment causing `no_python2` mark to be fulfilled:\r\n```\r\n___________________________ BlackTestCase.test_python2_should_fail_without_optional_install ___________________________\r\n[gw2] win32 -- Python 3.8.9

information):**\r\n\r\n- Version: main\r\n- OS and Python version: Windows/Python 3.9.5\r\n\r\n**Does this bug also happen on main?**\r\n\r\nYes\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\n\r\nOriginally posted
