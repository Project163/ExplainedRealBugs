However, as of 21.4b0 black reformats empty docstrings to contain a space.\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**:\r\nSource:\r\n```\r\ndef foo():\r\n    \"\"\"\"\"\"\r\n    ...\r\n```\r\n\r\ngets reformatted to\r\n\r\n```\r\ndef foo():\r\n    \"\"\" \"\"\"\r\n    ...\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior** I'm generally supportive of the style changes introduced in #1740. However, in this case black is changing the code in a meaningful way. I suggest that empty docstrings be ignored as a special case. I am agnostic on whether the empty docstring should be spelled `\"\"` or `\"\"\"\"\"\"`.\r\n\r\n**Environment:**\r\n\r\n- Version: 21.4b2\r\n- OS and Python version: debian 10/Python 3.7.10\r\n\r\n**Does this bug also happen on master?** Yes\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"JelleZijlstra","id":906600,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkwNjYwMA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/906600?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra","html_url":"https://github.com/JelleZijlstra","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/psf/black/issues/2168/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/psf/black/issues/2168/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
