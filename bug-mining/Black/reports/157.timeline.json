The following example shows the newly accepted variables in `conda-forge.yml` for this capability **(example updated to reflect the final status)**:\r\n```jinja\r\nazure:\r\n  settings_linux:\r\n    pool:\r\n      name: Our_Local_Pool\r\n      demands:\r\n        - tagA -equals 2\r\n    workspace:\r\n      clean: all\r\n    strategy:\r\n      maxParallel: 1\r\ndocker:\r\n  run_args: -t --rm\r\n```\r\nnsls-ii-forge/cupy-feedstock#1 is a real working PR with the Azure (Linux) agent backed by a local machine. The meanings and the hierarchy of variables follow directly the definition in the [Azure Pipelines documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/process/phases?view=azure-devops&tabs=yaml#define-a-single-job). \r\n\r\nThe addition of the `run_args` variable is a follow-up of #1279, which will be passed to `CONDA_FORGE_DOCKER_RUN_ARGS`.
