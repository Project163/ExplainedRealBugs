I think of vertical whitespace as a separator, not a way of emphasizing the previous line. Why do you put the emphasis line after the control statement, instead of before it? Why do these statements in particular need extra emphasis? If they do, then wouldn't it be better to configure your syntax highlighter to wrap them in `<b><blink>...</blink></b>` or something? Should we ask Guido to rename the tokens to `RETURN` and `YIELD` to make sure no-one misses them? (Presumably during the transition period we'd have to do `from __future__ import SHOUTY_TOKENS`, but `black` could insert that for us.)\r\n\r\nOf course all style guidelines are idiosyncratic and part of the reward for spending lots of time working on a tool like `black` is to make sure that it's *your* idiosyncratic preferences that everyone ends up using, so feel free to ignore this. But I figured I'd at least open an issue so people can click the little emoji buttons before it gets closed as WONTFIX.","closed_by":{"login":"ambv","id":55281,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1Mjgx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55281?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambv","html_url":"https://github.com/ambv","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambv/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambv/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambv/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambv/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambv/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambv/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambv/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambv/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambv/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/psf/black/issues/90/reactions","total_count":4,"+1":4,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/psf/black/issues/90/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
