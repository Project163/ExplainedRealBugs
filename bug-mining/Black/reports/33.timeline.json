There are three problems:\r\n\r\n1. Trailing comma gets put in a wrong place if there's a trailing comment. Example:\r\n```\r\n    assert scenario.connect_times == {\r\n        \"1.1.1.1\": 0,\r\n        \"2.2.2.2\": 0.300,\r\n        # 3.3.3.3 was never even started\r\n        ,\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n2. When `# yapf: disable` was found in trio/_core/tests/test_run.py, Black decided to discard that content entirely. 🤣\r\n\r\n3. Or should I say, 18. This is again a `# yapf: disable`-related bug. This time it's when you disable twice in a row. Black doesn't support statement-level format disabling and it gets confused by this.\r\n```\r\nasync def test_getaddrinfo(monkeygai):\r\n    check(res, [\r\n        (tsocket.AF_INET,  # 127.0.0.1 is

weekend.","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/psf/black/issues/comments/377674767/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"ambv","id":55281,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1Mjgx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55281?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambv","html_url":"https://github.com/ambv","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambv/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambv/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambv/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambv/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambv/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambv/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambv/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambv/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambv/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":1550649227,"node_id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDE1NTA2NDkyMjc=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/psf/black/issues/events/1550649227","actor":{"login":"ambv","id":55281,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1Mjgx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55281?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambv","html_url":"https://github.com/ambv","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambv/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambv/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambv/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambv/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambv/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambv/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambv/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambv/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambv/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-03-31T07:56:56Z","label":{"name":"bug","color":"d73a4a"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":1550649228,"node_id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDE1NTA2NDkyMjg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/psf/black/issues/events/1550649228","actor":{"login":"ambv","id":55281,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1Mjgx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55281?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambv","html_url":"https://github.com/ambv","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambv/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambv/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambv/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambv/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambv/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambv/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambv/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambv/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambv/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-03-31T07:56:56Z","label":{"name":"invalid
