later.","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/psf/black/issues/comments/375918861/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"ambv","id":55281,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1Mjgx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55281?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambv","html_url":"https://github.com/ambv","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambv/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambv/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambv/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambv/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambv/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambv/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambv/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambv/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambv/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/psf/black/issues/comments/375920087","html_url":"https://github.com/psf/black/issues/51#issuecomment-375920087","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/psf/black/issues/51","id":375920087,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM3NTkyMDA4Nw==","user":{"login":"zsol","id":66740,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2NzQw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/66740?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsol","html_url":"https://github.com/zsol","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsol/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsol/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsol/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsol/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsol/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsol/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsol/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsol/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsol/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-03-24T19:50:44Z","updated_at":"2018-03-24T19:50:44Z","body":"Sounds

someone who primarily uses double quotes for strings, I'd be a bit sad if Black started enforcing single quotes everywhere. My own reasons for using double quotes are, as far as I can tell (in no particular order):\r\n\r\n- Docstrings (and triple-quoted strings in general) almost exclusively use double quotes, per PEP 8, and using different quotes for docstrings and normal strings doesn't make much sense to me.\r\n- Double quotes are more visible than single quotes (it's easier for me to spot a stray `\"` than a `'`).\r\n- Similarly to the above, it's possible to confuse \" for '', especially in variable-width fonts: if you write the empty string as `''`, it's possible to confuse it with `\"` at a glance, but nobody will confuse `\"\"` with anything.\r\n- C uses double quotes for strings.\r\n- *Within* strings, I use single quotes (for contractions like \"don't\") much more than I use double quotes, and no matter what PEP 8 says, switching between `'` and `\"` based on the contents of the string always feels a bit awkward.\r\n- I think, although it's hard to tell, that it's actually easier for me to type double quotes than single quotes; my right pinky is normally somewhere near backspace, whereas my left middle finger is usually right next to `\"` (it's probably worth noting that I'm using a UK keyboard!).\r\n\r\nIt would be nice if there was a config option for this, if only to save some UK programmers' right pinky fingers some work :)","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/psf/black/issues/comments/375932370/reactions","total_count":3,"+1":2,"-1":1,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"keysmashes","id":9433472,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk0MzM0NzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9433472?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/keysmashes","html_url":"https://github.com/keysmashes","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keysmashes/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keysmashes/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keysmashes/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keysmashes/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keysmashes/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keysmashes/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keysmashes/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keysmashes/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/keysmashes/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/psf/black/issues/comments/375934662","html_url":"https://github.com/psf/black/issues/51#issuecomment-375934662","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/psf/black/issues/51","id":375934662,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM3NTkzNDY2Mg==","user":{"login":"ambv","id":55281,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1Mjgx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55281?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambv","html_url":"https://github.com/ambv","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambv/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambv/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambv/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambv/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambv/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambv/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambv/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambv/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambv/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-03-25T00:12:27Z","updated_at":"2018-03-25T00:12:27Z","body":"Black's mission is to make all blackened code look the same.

If you are ever confusing a double quote for an empty single-quoted string, or if you ever have a problem spotting a stray apostrophe, I would suggest abandoning Microsoft Word and adopting a code editor that highlights your syntax and uses a fixed-width font 😏 \r\n\r\nSmirk aside, I can't disagree with the docstring argument, hence I think triple quotes should be using `\"\"\"`. I also agree that starting a string with `\"` makes it apostrophe-proof 😄 I also understand the UK keyboard argument, I think this also applies to the German layout. We could play the numbers game about which layout is more often used and I'd be surprised if the US (aka international) layout wouldn't win by a large margin.

I'll share some more of my long-term plan and you can all tell me what you think.\r\n\r\nWe're going to mess with strings in Black. We're going to join implicitly concatenated string literals (see #26). To be able to do this, we will have to normalize quotes (and prefixes if it doesn't matter). If we're already doing that, let's do that everywhere. In fact, we're going to fight implicit string concatenation because it causes site outages.\r\n\r\nMore generally, Black is different from existing propositions for Python because it's not afraid to modify the AST beyond whitespace. We're going to be adding and removing parentheses when it makes sense, which will help with wrapping lines in some cases. We are already making trailing commas more consistent. String literals are just another category in the same vein.\r\n\r\nAnd a total bird's eye view is this. Black is not just a machine code formatter. It is a code style. When a project sports the [![Code style: black](https://img.shields.io/badge/code%20style-black-000000.svg)](https://github.com/ambv/black) badge, it doesn't just mean \"I use this tool\". It tells people that this project uses the same style as all blackened code. That's why the badge says \"code style\", not \"formatter\".\r\n\r\nIf this code style consistently makes teams develop 1% faster, debug 1% faster, and the code 1% less buggy, discussions about whether a single quote or a double quote looks nicer become laughable. And I think 1% is conservative.\r\n","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/psf/black/issues/comments/376062063/reactions","total_count":5,"+1":4,"-1":1,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"ambv","id":55281,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1Mjgx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55281?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambv","html_url":"https://github.com/ambv","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambv/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambv/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambv/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambv/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambv/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambv/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambv/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambv/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambv/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":1540115697,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MTU0MDExNTY5Nw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/psf/black/issues/events/1540115697","actor":{"login":"carljm","id":61586,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYxNTg2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/61586?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/carljm","html_url":"https://github.com/carljm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/carljm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/carljm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/carljm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/carljm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/carljm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/carljm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/carljm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/carljm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/carljm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-03-26T06:42:32Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":1540115698,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDE1NDAxMTU2OTg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/psf/black/issues/events/1540115698","actor":{"login":"carljm","id":61586,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYxNTg2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/61586?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/carljm","html_url":"https://github.com/carljm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/carljm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/carljm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/carljm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/carljm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/carljm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/carljm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/carljm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/carljm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/carljm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-03-26T06:42:32Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/psf/black/issues/comments/376114822","html_url":"https://github.com/psf/black/issues/51#issuecomment-376114822","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/psf/black/issues/51","id":376114822,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM3NjExNDgyMg==","user":{"login":"gaggle","id":2316447,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMTY0NDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2316447?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaggle","html_url":"https://github.com/gaggle","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaggle/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaggle/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaggle/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaggle/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaggle/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaggle/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaggle/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaggle/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaggle/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-03-26T10:07:22Z","updated_at":"2018-03-26T10:08:29Z","body":"Just
