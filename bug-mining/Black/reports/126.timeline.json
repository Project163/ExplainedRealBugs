related to any of the changes I made recently but I looked into it.\r\n\r\nThe issue here is that the `# type: ignore` attached to the end of the original line prevents everything from getting collapsed onto one line (since it is a type comment in the \"middle\" of a potential line), but it is still attached to the `or` and so it gets moved down to the second line.\r\n\r\nBut then on the second run, it's not in the middle anymore, so black thinks it is safe to collapse everything onto one line.\r\n\r\nOne fix to this would be to not have internal `type: ignore` comments prevent merging lines. This fixes the issue here, but I'm not totally confident it fixes the issue always. It also changes some behavior and will make it harder to ignore a specific argument to a function without ignoring the whole call in some cases.\r\n\r\nAnother possibility could be to go the other direction and consider a type comment (just an ignore?) at the *end* uncollapsable also, so we stick with the version split on two lines?","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/psf/black/issues/comments/541943547/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"msullivan","id":340349,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MDM0OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/340349?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/msullivan","html_url":"https://github.com/msullivan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/msullivan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/msullivan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/msullivan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/msullivan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/msullivan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/msullivan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/msullivan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/msullivan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/msullivan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"actor":{"login":"JelleZijlstra","id":906600,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkwNjYwMA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/906600?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra","html_url":"https://github.com/JelleZijlstra","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-10-20T16:44:58Z","updated_at":"2019-10-20T16:44:58Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/psf/black/issues/1074","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/psf/black","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/psf/black/issues/1074/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/psf/black/issues/1074/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/psf/black/issues/1074/events","html_url":"https://github.com/psf/black/issues/1074","id":508828482,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU1MDg4Mjg0ODI=","number":1074,"title":"/aiohttp/pytest_plugin.py produced different code on second pass","user":{"login":"briglx","id":1304774,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMDQ3NzQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1304774?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/briglx","html_url":"https://github.com/briglx","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/briglx/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/briglx/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/briglx/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/briglx/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/briglx/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/briglx/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/briglx/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/briglx/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/briglx/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":867432792,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw4Njc0MzI3OTI=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/psf/black/labels/T:%20bug","name":"T: bug","color":"d73a4a","default":false,"description":"Something isn't working"},{"id":869137302,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw4NjkxMzczMDI=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/psf/black/labels/F:%20comments","name":"F: comments","color":"BFD4F2","default":false,"description":"The syntactic kind.
