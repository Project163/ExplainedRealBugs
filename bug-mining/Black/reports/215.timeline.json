I agree there's definite benefits to wrapping these strings in parentheses. My only reservation is that sometimes the parentheses feel redundant and verbose. For example, I don't love the change in https://github.com/psf/black/pull/3307/files#diff-d23a6917d7262ca9815093bffb7148299e516575251959ed9b405b648e76aa29. On the other hand, the change in https://github.com/psf/black/pull/3307/files#diff-116e83ac321f88d78cac1d0b7058473a5853b7753b37e121e3674e282038f763 is definitely an improvement: the old code is not at all clear that there are two string arguments.\r\n\r\nI think on balance it's more important to prevent bugs from implicitly concatenated strings, so we should land the change.

the style change**\r\n\r\nI'm not sure if this is intended or not, but I noticed that sometimes in Black >=22.12.0 a trailing comma will trigger wrapping the concatenated string in parens, which otherwise wouldn't take place (if there was no trailing comma).\r\n\r\nThe suggestion is to make it so that the presence of the trailing comma would have no bearing on whether the concatenated string will or not be wrapped in parens.\r\n\r\nPS: In this particular case the trailing commas are added's by Ruff's COM rules: https://beta.ruff.rs/docs/rules/#flake8-commas-com\r\n\r\n**Examples in the

PR adds a test to verify that the `fill` element can be used to implement Black's [string-processing](https://github.com/psf/black/issues/3292)\r\n\r\nThe \"full\" implementation needs to split all strings by words and create a single `fill` element for it. But that seems straightforward so that it isn't covered by this test.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/astral-sh/ruff/issues/4449/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/astral-sh/ruff/issues/4449/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"actor":{"login":"KotlinIsland","id":65446343,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1NDQ2MzQz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/65446343?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/KotlinIsland","html_url":"https://github.com/KotlinIsland","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KotlinIsland/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KotlinIsland/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KotlinIsland/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KotlinIsland/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KotlinIsland/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KotlinIsland/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KotlinIsland/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KotlinIsland/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KotlinIsland/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-10-19T00:10:57Z","updated_at":"2023-10-19T00:10:57Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/psf/black/issues/3955","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/psf/black","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/psf/black/issues/3955/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/psf/black/issues/3955/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/psf/black/issues/3955/events","html_url":"https://github.com/psf/black/issues/3955","id":1950934850,"node_id":"I_kwDOB3dpmM50SOdC","number":3955,"title":"(🎁) String processing: re-enable wrap concatenated strings in parens in all cases","user":{"login":"KotlinIsland","id":65446343,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1NDQ2MzQz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/65446343?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/KotlinIsland","html_url":"https://github.com/KotlinIsland","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KotlinIsland/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KotlinIsland/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KotlinIsland/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KotlinIsland/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KotlinIsland/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KotlinIsland/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KotlinIsland/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KotlinIsland/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KotlinIsland/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":867432792,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw4Njc0MzI3OTI=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/psf/black/labels/T:%20bug","name":"T: bug","color":"d73a4a","default":false,"description":"Something isn't working"},{"id":4923632282,"node_id":"LA_kwDOB3dpmM8AAAABJXiqmg","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/psf/black/labels/C:%20preview%20style","name":"C: preview style","color":"E4C5D3","default":false,"description":"Issues with the preview and unstable style.
