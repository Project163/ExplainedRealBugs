would be neat to be able to navigate from the changelog directly to the GitHub issues that are referenced. This can be very easily achieved with a Sphinx extension:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n# conf.py\r\nextensions = [\r\n    'sphinx.ext.extlinks',\r\n]\r\nextlinks = {\r\n    'issue': ('https://github.com/psf/black/issues/%s', '#'),\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen ```- Thing fixed (:issue:`31`)``` renders as \"Thing fixed ([#31](https://github.com/psf/black/issues/31))\" with the link. Luckily it works unmodified for pull requests too, but adding another one would of course be trivial. I do recognise that it would mean converting the changelog from markdown to ReST, sacrificing readability of the plain text version. But I think that downside could be mitigated by moving the file to `docs` and linking users to the RTD site in readmes and whatnot.\r\n\r\nThe benefit is perhaps minimal, and since it changes things feel free to close this issue if it's not to your liking. Just came to mind while reading the documentation. Also, I would be willing to contribute this change.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/psf/black/issues/2087/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/psf/black/issues/2087/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
