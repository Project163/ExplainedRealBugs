Please describe.** A clear and concise\r\n\r\nIn some cases one would want to put non-ASCII characters in source. This is most common\r\nfor strings, but in Python 3 you can use non-ASCII identifiers as well.\r\n\r\nBut consider the following example:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nparser.add_argument(\r\n    \"poem\", help=\"Poem to process\",\r\n    default=\"ちはやふる神代もきかず竜田川からくれなゐに水くくるとは\",\r\n)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe `default` line is visually long, and I’d like to put it on its own line. But Black would insist formatting it into\r\n\r\n```python\r\nparser.add_argument(\r\n    \"poem\", help=\"Poem to process\", default=\"ちはやふる神代もきかず竜田川からくれなゐに水くくるとは\"\r\n)\r\n```\r\n\r\nsince it thinks there is enough space (indeed, the formatted line is only 73 characters long).\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\n\r\nWhen calculating line lengths, Black should consult the [width attribute](http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr11/tr11-36.html) of each character, and count double width for characters with EAW *F* or *W*.\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\n\r\nHaving strictly single-width characters in source, and pull in double-width strings at runtime (via i18n or `\\u` sequences. The translation system is usually an overkill cases (e.g. developing an in-house CLI where all users speak a common East Asian language), and replacing all strings with `\\u` make the source illegible to humans.\r\n\r\nUsgin `fmt: on/off` becomes tedious and hard to the eye quickly when you need a lot of string scattered around (e.g. for logging purposes).\r\n\r\n**Additional context** Add any other context or screenshots about the feature request\r\nhere.\r\n\r\n![Screenshot 2019-12-09 at 15 00 35](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/605277/70414310-ae4d3980-1a94-11ea-9ad2-c5864807b0e5.png)\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"cobaltt7","id":61329810,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYxMzI5ODEw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/61329810?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cobaltt7","html_url":"https://github.com/cobaltt7","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cobaltt7/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cobaltt7/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cobaltt7/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cobaltt7/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cobaltt7/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cobaltt7/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cobaltt7/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cobaltt7/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cobaltt7/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/psf/black/issues/1197/reactions","total_count":8,"+1":8,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/psf/black/issues/1197/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
