To confirm this, you have three options:\r\n\r\n1. Update Black's version if a newer release exists: `pip install -U black`\r\n2. Use the online formatter at <https://black.vercel.app/?version=main>, which will use\r\n   the latest main branch.\r\n3. Or run _Black_ on your machine:\r\n   - create a new virtualenv (make sure it's the same Python version);\r\n   - clone this repository;\r\n   - run `pip install -e .[d]`;\r\n   - run `pip install -r test_requirements.txt`\r\n   - make sure it's sane by running `python -m pytest`; and\r\n   - run `black` like you did last time.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n**Describe the bug**\r\nFollowing with the official [docs](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/integrations/editors.html#vim)\r\n> On first run, the plugin creates its own virtualenv using the right Python version and automatically installs

function black#Black:\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Explanations**\r\nMy default `python3` has version `3.10.9` but `python3.11` also installed.\r\nPath  `'/opt/homebrew/opt/python@3.11/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.11/bin/` exists and fit look like\r\n```bash\r\n$ ls -1 /opt/homebrew/opt/python@3.11/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.11/bin/\r\n2to3-3.11\r\nidle3.11\r\npip3\r\npip3.11\r\npydoc3.11\r\npython3.11\r\npython3.11-config\r\n```\r\nThere is no `python3`. `bin` of other *non-default* python version also not include  `python3`.\r\nIt not seems to be `homebrew` bug, but may. \r\n\r\n\r\n**Reasons** \r\nMy version of MacVim uses non-default python version `==3.11` . \r\n```shell vim --version | grep python\r\n$ +cmdline_hist      +langmap           -python            +viminfo\r\n+cmdline_info      +libcall           +python3

[here](https://github.com/psf/black/blob/91e1e1328aa0a11ef50017316ff97149886e1b05/autoload/black.vim#L46). \r\nIn my opinion, it should be like `f'python{pyver[0]}.{pyver[1]}'`.
