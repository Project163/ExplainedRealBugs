First, some background on these warnings... The issue has little to do with `re`, the issue is with the use of any invalid escape sequence in any Python string — it just comes up with `re` because people use a lot of backslashes in regular expressions.\r\n\r\nSee https://docs.python.org/3/reference/lexical_analysis.html#escape-sequences , in particular:\r\n> Changed in version 3.6: Unrecognized escape sequences produce a [DeprecationWarning](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#DeprecationWarning).\r\n> Changed in version 3.12: Unrecognized escape sequences produce a [SyntaxWarning](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#SyntaxWarning). In a future Python version they will be eventually a [SyntaxError](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#SyntaxError).\r\n\r\nIf you run your code with `PYTHONWARNINGS=error`, it will actually raise an Exception today (and as above, will raise `SyntaxError` in some future version of Python).\r\n```\r\nλ python -c 'invalid_escape = \"\\/\"'\r\nλ PYTHONWARNINGS=error python -c 'invalid_escape = \"\\/\"'\r\n  File \"<string>\", line 1\r\n    invalid_escape = \"\\/\"\r\n                     ^^^^\r\nSyntaxError: invalid escape sequence '\\/'\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnyway, with that said, your code is legal today (if deprecated) and your use of deprecated invalid escape sequences isn't really part of Black's business, so Black should probably swallow these warnings.","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/psf/black/issues/comments/1913554216/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"hauntsaninja","id":12621235,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNjIxMjM1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12621235?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja","html_url":"https://github.com/hauntsaninja","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":11619630863,"node_id":"REFE_lADOB3dpmM59aP1OzwAAAAK0lX8P","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/psf/black/issues/events/11619630863","actor":{"login":"hauntsaninja","id":12621235,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNjIxMjM1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12621235?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja","html_url":"https://github.com/hauntsaninja","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"e7aafccdd3f310dcfba4df2cc73e473baac977a0","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/hauntsaninja/black/commits/e7aafccdd3f310dcfba4df2cc73e473baac977a0","created_at":"2024-01-28T10:57:23Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"actor":{"login":"hauntsaninja","id":12621235,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNjIxMjM1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12621235?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja","html_url":"https://github.com/hauntsaninja","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-01-28T10:57:47Z","updated_at":"2024-01-28T10:57:47Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/psf/black/issues/4189","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/psf/black","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/psf/black/issues/4189/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/psf/black/issues/4189/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/psf/black/issues/4189/events","html_url":"https://github.com/psf/black/pull/4189","id":2104102583,"node_id":"PR_kwDOB3dpmM5lQLa6","number":4189,"title":"Swallow
