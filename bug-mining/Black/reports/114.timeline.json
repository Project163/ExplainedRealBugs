version:\r\nThat seems fine\r\n\r\nBackstory:\r\nThis came up while converting from pylint style to black. The function in question had a lot of parameters. The pylint exclusion needs to be on the same line as the def but the exclusion itself was pushing the line over the line limit. So someone had used the / to put the exclusion on a separate line, instead of the black approach of splitting the ().\r\nI've tested the case where a def is over the limit because of a comment and of course black handles that totally fine, so this fix sounds on point.\r\n\r\nAside:\r\nThis was the only thing that failed during the conversion. There were a few other things that we're formatted in ways people didn't like but repeating \"that's the Black default\" enough times eventually shut them up :)","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/psf/black/issues/comments/491779526/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"ghost","id":10137,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMTM3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10137?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost","html_url":"https://github.com/ghost","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}}]
