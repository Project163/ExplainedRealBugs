The current (relevant) items [on our docs](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/usage_and_configuration/the_basics.html#the-basics) are:\r\n\r\n- it does nothing if no sources are passed to it;\r\n- it will read from standard input and write to standard output if - is used as the filename;\r\n- exits with code 0 unless an internal error occurred (or --check was used).\r\n\r\nThis is problematic, not least because we definitely exit with error codes if arguments are invalid and might do so in other cases as well. So firstly I might argue that we *should* exit with non-zero on user errors (as we do already). Extending that, and keeping in mind previous discussions about running Black without arguments (#704, #740, #861), I'd argue that an invocation without arguments *should* be considered a user error. Allowing no sources but making Black do nothing is a bit confusing. It's a different story if a source is passed but no Python files are found.\r\n\r\nQuick question: historically, why does `--code` exist when stdin can be used in similar situations? I might just not be able to think of the use cases here.\r\n\r\nAnyways, *given* that we'll keep `--code` I'd propose the following:\r\n\r\n- it fails if no sources are passed to it;\r\n- it will read from stdin if `-` is passed as source\r\n- it exits with 0 on success, 1 on fails, user errors and `--check` with reformats, 123 on internal error\r\n- it treats `SRC ...` items as lines of code if `--code` was passed (new with this issue)\r\n\r\nIs this too dense? 😄","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/psf/black/issues/comments/1012517463/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"felix-hilden","id":25202257,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1MjAyMjU3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25202257?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/felix-hilden","html_url":"https://github.com/felix-hilden","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/felix-hilden/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/felix-hilden/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/felix-hilden/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/felix-hilden/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/felix-hilden/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/felix-hilden/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/felix-hilden/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/felix-hilden/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/felix-hilden/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/psf/black/issues/comments/1019915832","html_url":"https://github.com/psf/black/issues/2360#issuecomment-1019915832","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/psf/black/issues/2360","id":1019915832,"node_id":"IC_kwDOB3dpmM48yq44","user":{"login":"felix-hilden","id":25202257,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1MjAyMjU3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25202257?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/felix-hilden","html_url":"https://github.com/felix-hilden","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/felix-hilden/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/felix-hilden/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/felix-hilden/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/felix-hilden/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/felix-hilden/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/felix-hilden/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/felix-hilden/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/felix-hilden/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/felix-hilden/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-01-24T09:56:29Z","updated_at":"2022-01-24T09:56:29Z","body":"After testing things: having SRC be also code is pretty hard and annoying to pull off, because we have a bunch of path validation and automatic config extraction.
