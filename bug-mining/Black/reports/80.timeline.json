In particular, it's the only working way to specify build-time dependencies, and it will be where projects specify which build system they're using (see PEP 517) if they don't want to use distutils.\r\n\r\n(We did consider standardizing setup.cfg of course, but the cfg format is pretty bad, it's specifically supposed to be the config file for setup.py which we're trying to deprecate, and then other projects have also jammed stuff in there in an ad hoc way. Migration is kind of up to individual projects, since there's never been any standard for using setup.cfg so who knows what different projects have done. For a project like pbr that's deeply tied to distutils/setuptools, continuing to use setup.cfg probably makes most sense. For a project like pytest that just use setup.cfg as one of the like 4 places they check for config data, migration probably just means adding pyproject.toml to the list of places they check, and then maybe starting a deprecation cycle for setup.cfg-based config, if they feel like it.

And then, if I take your advice and ignore existence of `setup.cfg` to use `pyproject.toml` instead, unsuspecting users will keep pestering me for `setup.cfg` support for years to come. I don't control their migration schedule. And since Python doesn't have a built-in TOML parser, at this point having your own config file actually seems preferable.

As @sigmavirus24 is pointing out, this is a trap. I just found this fun example where everything is terrible:\r\n```\r\na\r\n├── b\r\n│   └── c\r\n│       ├── d\r\n│       │   └── file.py\r\n│       └── pyproject.toml\r\n└── pyproject.toml\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen the user runs `black a`, they would expect that `a/b/c/d/file.py` is going to be formatted according to `a/b/c/pyproject.toml`, not `a/pyproject.toml`. So a single run of Black would have to support potentially many configurations.\r\n\r\nBetter yet though: `a/pyproject.toml` might have excluded (see #270) `a/b/c` entirely. With naive config shadowing, that would not work. Also, we can't just compose previous includes and excludes because they can easily be contradictory. They are freeform regular expressions after all.\r\n\r\nSo unless somebody comes up with a brilliant solution for this, my current inclination is to support *one* configuration. That configuration would be searched for in the common base directory for all paths passed to `black` and this directory's ancestors. A presence of a pyproject.toml deeper in the tree would raise a warning on stderr saying \"warning: ignored a/b/c/d/pyproject.toml, configuration in a/pyproject.toml used instead.\"\r\n\r\nWhile this won't enable people to nicely specify sub-directories which are, say, Python 3.6+ safe or use a custom line length (for tests/ or whatever), they can set up an exclude list in the base configuration for those directories, and configure them separately. That will require running `black` separately on those directories but I think that's a fair limitation.","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/psf/black/issues/comments/393980249/reactions","total_count":3,"+1":3,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"ambv","id":55281,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1Mjgx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55281?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambv","html_url":"https://github.com/ambv","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambv/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambv/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambv/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambv/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambv/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambv/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambv/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambv/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambv/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":1658995601,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MTY1ODk5NTYwMQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/psf/black/issues/events/1658995601","actor":{"login":"sigmavirus24","id":240830,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0MDgzMA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/240830?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sigmavirus24","html_url":"https://github.com/sigmavirus24","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sigmavirus24/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sigmavirus24/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sigmavirus24/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sigmavirus24/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sigmavirus24/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sigmavirus24/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sigmavirus24/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sigmavirus24/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sigmavirus24/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-06-01T19:05:39Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":1658995602,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDE2NTg5OTU2MDI=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/psf/black/issues/events/1658995602","actor":{"login":"sigmavirus24","id":240830,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0MDgzMA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/240830?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sigmavirus24","html_url":"https://github.com/sigmavirus24","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sigmavirus24/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sigmavirus24/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sigmavirus24/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sigmavirus24/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sigmavirus24/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sigmavirus24/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sigmavirus24/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sigmavirus24/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sigmavirus24/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-06-01T19:05:39Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/psf/black/issues/comments/393981496","html_url":"https://github.com/psf/black/issues/65#issuecomment-393981496","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/psf/black/issues/65","id":393981496,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM5Mzk4MTQ5Ng==","user":{"login":"ambv","id":55281,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1Mjgx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55281?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambv","html_url":"https://github.com/ambv","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambv/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambv/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambv/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambv/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambv/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambv/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambv/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambv/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambv/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-06-01T19:10:39Z","updated_at":"2018-06-01T19:10:39Z","body":"`tox

I do wish I had considered this in Flake8 a lot sooner. In essence, I think what I plan to do is (when I ever have the time) make it such that one config file can specify paths that have their own rules. This will simplify how we find/understand config but also allow the granularity that people want. In Flake8's case, we have an abstraction called the \"StyleGuide\" so I was thinking of making one extra layer that manages a set of StyleGuides based on the config file.

Particularly given that ``--exclude`` isn't additive, but replaces the default excludes, meaning that for our (pip) use case, the command to execute ends up looking like ``black --exclude  /(\\.git|\\.mypy_cache|\\.tox|build|dist|src/pip/_vendor)/ .``.\r\n\r\nI think within a singular project you're going to end up with people running black in many different locations, for pip I know that if we adopt black, there is a desire to have the following workflows work:\r\n\r\n* People who use black formatting via their editor.\r\n* People who have tox installed, and are happy to just run ``tox -e format``.\r\n* People who don't have tox installed, but are happy to install black to run ``black``.\r\n\r\nWe might potentially also add\r\n\r\n* A Pre commit hook that contributors can install.\r\n\r\nSo that's 3, maybe 4 mechanisms of invocation, of which 2 of them would require basically just documenting a regex that uses have to copy/paste into their shell or another config file (and then convince them to update it if we ever need to adjust that regex). That's not a great situation to be in.\r\n\r\nIn response to the problems listed in https://github.com/ambv/black/issues/65#issuecomment-394511760, i'd say:\r\n\r\n* People who are using the (small amount of) configuration that black enables, are presumably doing so for good reason. Allowing them to more easily use that configuration that they do have means that projects that need that configuration are more likely going to be able to use black. Omitting the ability to do this just feels like it makes the experience of using black significantly worse (imagine a new contributor coming into a project seeing it uses black, and running just ``black`` on it, ignoring the configuration that the project expects and then getting linting errors and being told to go back and redo it. That's friction that makes the contributor more likely to just drop off and not re-contribute).\r\n  * This also requires things like editors to gain a per-project configuration for black, since one project might use ``--line-length 88``, while another uses 80, and another uses 120.\r\n* I don't think this is true, I think having ``--line-length`` at all opens the door for that (and the similar options like ``--py36`` and ``--skip-string-normalization``). I think making it practical to use the configuration that you already have doesn't do anything more to open that door.\r\n* I don't think merging is an issue, at least not with the settings you have now. None of your settings use append or merging now , they're all just flags or value overrides. So you don't really need much beyond like taking the options from the config file, shoving them in a dict, and then taking the options from the CLI and calling ``.update()`` on it. You don't have any data structures that need a deep merge.\r\n* I think you should use ``pyproject.toml``, and I think the concerns about slowing down parsing are.. premature. Walking the filesystem and reading and parsing all of the ``.py`` files is likely going to take a lot more time than parsing TOML. I found some random huge JSON file and converted it to a TOML file, that TOML file was 171MB large and in a completely unscientific test of ``python -c \"import toml; f = open('citylots.toml'); d = toml.loads(f.read())\"``, that took 2m30s to read the file and parse it, which gives us like, 1.2MB/s. I really don't think we're ever going to get a ``pyproject.toml`` file that hits anywhere close to even a full MB in size (and if some project out there does, that project is going to be an extreme edge case). I'm going to guess that the random toml library I pulled off of PyPI is also not optimized to it's fullest so if performance. However, if you're really concerned about this, use a different file, I think that's less optimal but still fine.\r\n* You don't have much in the way of configuration, so your documentation isn't going to be very long anyways.\r\n* I'm not sure what this means exactly, but I don't think it's an issue. Like I said above, you don't have any structures where you need to do any sort of deep merging. This should be as simple as a ``{data from config file}.update({data from CLI})``.\r\n\r\nThat being said, I wouldn't support path based configuration. That seems like a rabbit hole of mess that you really don't want to be in. Generally supporting multiple formats for different files seems like a huge edge case (and goes against PEP8 to begin with, since consistency within a project is the most important constraint).","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/psf/black/issues/comments/395059687/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"dstufft","id":145979,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0NTk3OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/145979?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstufft","html_url":"https://github.com/dstufft","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstufft/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstufft/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstufft/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstufft/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstufft/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstufft/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstufft/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstufft/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstufft/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/psf/black/issues/comments/395079881","html_url":"https://github.com/psf/black/issues/65#issuecomment-395079881","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/psf/black/issues/65","id":395079881,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM5NTA3OTg4MQ==","user":{"login":"sigmavirus24","id":240830,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0MDgzMA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/240830?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sigmavirus24","html_url":"https://github.com/sigmavirus24","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sigmavirus24/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sigmavirus24/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sigmavirus24/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sigmavirus24/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sigmavirus24/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sigmavirus24/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sigmavirus24/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sigmavirus24/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sigmavirus24/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-06-06T14:03:03Z","updated_at":"2018-06-06T14:03:03Z","body":">
