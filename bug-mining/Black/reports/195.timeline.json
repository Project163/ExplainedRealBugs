Hello! Thanks for submitting a PR. To help make things go a bit more\r\n     smoothly we would appreciate that you go through this template. -->\r\n\r\n### Description\r\nFixes #2506\r\n\r\n``XDG_CACHE_HOME`` does not work on Windows. To allow for users to set a custom cache directory on all systems I added a new environment variable ``BLACK_CACHE_DIR`` to set the cache directory. The default remains the same so users will only notice a change if that environment variable is set.\r\n\r\nThe specific use case I have for this is I need to run black on in different processes at the same time. There is a race condition with the cache pickle file that made this rather difficult. A custom cache directory will remove the race condition.\r\n\r\nI created ``get_cache_dir`` function in order to test the logic. This is only used to set the ``CACHE_DIR`` constant.\r\n\r\n### Checklist - did you ...\r\n\r\n<!-- If any of the following items aren't relevant for your contribution\r\n     please still tick them so we know you've gone through the checklist.\r\n\r\n    All user-facing changes should get an entry. Otherwise, signal to us\r\n    this should get the magical label to silence the CHANGELOG entry check.\r\n    Tests are required for bugfixes and new features. Documentation changes\r\n    are necessary for formatting and most enhancement changes. -->\r\n\r\n- [x] Add a CHANGELOG entry if necessary?\r\n- [x] Add / update tests if necessary?\r\n    - Added ``test_get_cache_dir`` to ensure behavior is as expected.\r\n- [x] Add new / update outdated documentation?\r\n    - Updated ``file_collection_and_discovery.md`` to have users use the new environment variable rather than ``XDG_CACHE_HOME``. Still mention they can use ``XDG_CACHE_HOME`` on macOS and linux.\r\n    - Updated ``reference_functions.rst`` to autodoc new function.\r\n\r\n<!-- Just as a reminder, everyone in all psf/black spaces including PRs\r\n     must follow the PSF Code of Conduct (link below).\r\n\r\n     Finally, once again thanks for your time and effort.
