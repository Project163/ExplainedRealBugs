Add the following line to CHANGES.md:\r\n\r\n```\r\n  - `Black` now requires one-line docstrings to not have leading or trailing spaces (PR #1234)\r\n```\r\n\r\n2. Submit a PR containing this change.\r\n3. The Lint / build (3.7) (pull_request) check will fail since this line is too long. It states that this needs to be changed to:\r\n\r\n```\r\n- `Black` now requires one-line docstrings to not have leading or trailing spaces (PR\r\n  #1234)\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever making this change results in the Changelog Entry Check (pull_request) failing since it's grep for \"PR #1234\" does not match the PR reference now that has been split over two lines.\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior** \r\n\r\nChangelog Entry Check should match for \"PR #1234\" even if it is split over multiple lines. So the formatting required by Black can be accepted.\r\n\r\n**Environment (please complete the following information):**\r\n\r\n- Version:  master\r\n- OS and Python version: Github action\r\n\r\n**Does this bug also happen on master?**\r\n\r\nYes\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"JelleZijlstra","id":906600,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkwNjYwMA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/906600?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra","html_url":"https://github.com/JelleZijlstra","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/psf/black/issues/2070/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/psf/black/issues/2070/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
