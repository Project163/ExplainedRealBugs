Since black doesn't require a specific version of attrs, the existing installation was used causing this issue. In order to fix the issue, I installed the latest version of [attrs==17.4.0](https://pypi.org/project/attrs/17.4.0/). The old version was 17.2.0, which doesn't provide `attr.dataclass`. Looks like `attr.dataclass` was introduced in version 17.3.0.\r\n\r\nRegarding if this issue occurs on master: not really. Installing black by itself into a clean virtualenv doesn't cause any problems, since the latest version of attrs is used.\r\n\r\nSolution may be to pin the dependency at:\r\n\r\n```python\r\ninstall_requires=['click', 'attrs>17.2.0'],\r\n```\r\n\r\nin https://github.com/ambv/black/blob/1b696555e18afdfee3ca45526370de1af2cd961d/setup.py#L43","closed_by":{"login":"ambv","id":55281,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1Mjgx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55281?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambv","html_url":"https://github.com/ambv","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambv/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambv/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambv/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambv/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambv/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambv/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambv/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambv/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambv/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/psf/black/issues/54/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/psf/black/issues/54/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
