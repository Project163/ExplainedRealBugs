Python:\r\n\r\n```python\r\na = [1, 2]\r\nb = [\"3\", \"4\"]\r\n\r\nfor x in *a, *b:\r\n    print(x)\r\n\r\nc = *a, *b\r\nprint(c)\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nYields the following output:\r\n\r\n```\r\n1\r\n2\r\n3\r\n4\r\n(1, 2, '3', '4')\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut pylance marks the first `*` in line 4 (the `for`-loop) with `Expected expression`, the colon in the same line as `Expected \":\"`, and the second unpacking in line 7 (where `c` is assigned) as `Only one unpack operation allowed in list`.\r\n\r\nThis is probably (partly?) related to
