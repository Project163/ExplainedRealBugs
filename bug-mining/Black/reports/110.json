Sorry you're having trouble. To expedite your experience,\r\nprovide some basics for me:\r\n\r\nOperating system: Windows 10 64bit\r\nPython version: Python 3.7.0 (32Bit)\r\n*Black* version: 18.6b4\r\nDoes also happen on master: Yes\r\n\r\nWhen running black for directory it fails without any error when formatting.\r\n\r\nAs far as I can tell it happens here:\r\n`black.py@445`\r\n\r\n```py\r\ntasks = {\r\n        loop.run_in_executor(\r\n            executor,\r\n            format_file_in_place,\r\n            src,\r\n            line_length,\r\n            fast,\r\n            write_back,\r\n            mode,\r\n            lock,\r\n        ): src\r\n        for src in sorted(sources)\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo I'm not sure if it's an bug in black or somewhere deeper. Or it might just be a feature of running 32bit python3 on windows 64bit.\r\nIt doesn't happen when using py3.7 64bit. Nor on py3.6 64bit. When I have a moment I'll test it on py3.6 32bit.\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"JelleZijlstra","id":906600,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkwNjYwMA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/906600?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra","html_url":"https://github.com/JelleZijlstra","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/psf/black/issues/494/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/psf/black/issues/494/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
