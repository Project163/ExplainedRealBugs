Take this file:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nclass MyClass:\r\n    def my_def(self):\r\n        if self.magic == b\"BLP1\":\r\n            # Only present for BLP1\r\n            self._blp_encoding, = struct.unpack(\"<i\", self.fp.read(4))\r\n            self._blp_subtype, = struct.unpack(\"<i\", self.fp.read(4))\r\n```\r\n\r\n2. Run _Black_ on it with no arguments\r\n3. The comment is moved to the wrong place, and extra parenthesis are added, needing three lines instead of one:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nclass MyClass:\r\n    def my_def(self):\r\n        if self.magic == b\"BLP1\":\r\n            (self._blp_encoding,) = struct.unpack(  # Only present for BLP1\r\n                \"<i\", self.fp.read(4)\r\n            )\r\n            (self._blp_subtype,) = struct.unpack(\"<i\", self.fp.read(4))\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\n\r\nIf I now manually move the comment back to where it belongs:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nclass MyClass:\r\n    def my_def(self):\r\n        if self.magic == b\"BLP1\":\r\n            # Only present for BLP1\r\n            (self._blp_encoding,) = struct.unpack(\r\n                \"<i\", self.fp.read(4)\r\n            )\r\n            (self._blp_subtype,) = struct.unpack(\"<i\", self.fp.read(4))\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd re-run Black, it's tightened back up:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nclass MyClass:\r\n    def my_def(self):\r\n        if self.magic == b\"BLP1\":\r\n            # Only present for BLP1\r\n            (self._blp_encoding,) = struct.unpack(\"<i\", self.fp.read(4))\r\n            (self._blp_subtype,) = struct.unpack(\"<i\", self.fp.read(4))\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt'd be nice to see this on the first run.\r\n\r\nAnother (less disruptive) example of a moved comment here:\r\n\r\n* https://github.com/hugovk/Pillow/commit/c669a63e1118#diff-b49fc26d17e5d3b539a05c7850abe2b0L3259\r\n\r\n\r\n**Environment**\r\n\r\n- Version: master (version 19.3b1.dev123+g4c4a51c)\r\n- OS and Python version: macOS 10.14, Python 3.7.4\r\n\r\n**Does this bug also happen on master?**\r\n\r\nI've only tested master.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"ambv","id":55281,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1Mjgx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55281?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambv","html_url":"https://github.com/ambv","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambv/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambv/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambv/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambv/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambv/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambv/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambv/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambv/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambv/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/psf/black/issues/1097/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/psf/black/issues/1097/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
