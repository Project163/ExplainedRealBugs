Hello! Thanks for submitting a PR. To help make things go a bit more\r\n     smoothly we would appreciate that you go through this template. -->\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n<!-- Good things to put here include: reasoning for the change (please link\r\n     any relevant issues!), any noteworthy (or hacky) choices to be aware of,\r\n     or what the problem resolved here looked like ... we won't mind a ranty\r\n     story :) -->\r\n\r\nThis fixes #3678. The fix is done by adding two new functions to `node.py`, `is_tuple_containing_star` and `is_generator`, which are then added to the checks in `maybe_make_parens_invisible_in_atom` inside `linegen.py`, which is used by the function `remove_with_parens` that Jelle suggested modifying in a comment on #3678\r\n\r\nBoth functions are based on the existing `is_tuple_containing_walrus`. That makes me fairly confident in `is_tuple_containing_star`, since it does the same thing as `is_tuple_containing_walrus`, just with `syms.namedexpr_test` swapped for `syms.star_expr`. I'm less confident in `is_generator` since `for a in b` being called `syms.old_comp_for` seems weird and I don't totally understand `syms`/`_python_symbols`, but it seems to work.\r\n\r\nSide note, `_python_symbols` is really hard to work with since `node.type` prints as an integer and the `_python_symbol` variable <--> integer relationship is done via `setattr`, so I ended up having to do `[print(x, eval(f\"syms.{x}\") for x in dir(syms) if x[0:2] != \"__\"]` to figure out what type generators get.\r\n\r\nAs usual, both names subject to bikeshedding. I chose `is_tuple_containing_star` because it compares with `syms.star_expr`, but  `is_tuple_containing_unpacking` could also work. I chose `is_generator` since the issue is with a generator, though that could be something else since it doesn't match the `syms.old_comp_for` comparison.\r\n\r\nThe tests contain both a top level case and one where the issue is nested, since the nested case caused issues for me while making the fix.\r\n\r\n### Checklist - did you ...\r\n\r\n<!-- If any of the following items aren't relevant for your contribution\r\n     please still tick them so we know you've gone through the checklist.\r\n\r\n    All user-facing changes should get an entry.
