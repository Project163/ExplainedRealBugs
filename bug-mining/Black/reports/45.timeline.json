This is problematic to implement:\r\n- in this case we will destroy section headings which are way more common;\r\n- or we have to somehow detect which is which, this is tricky to do correctly and will always result with decisions that look wrong to a human.\r\n\r\nSo, I cut the Gordian knot and [said](https://github.com/ambv/black#empty-lines): if you want to comment on a function, do it in the docstring or as a first comment inside the function body. This is in the README: \r\n\r\nNote: if you provide me with a pull request that does differentiate between section headings and regular standalone comments that precede a function, I will happily accept it. I just decided this would be a time sink for me and I have higher priorities (see [\"Getting to beta\"](https://github.com/ambv/black/projects/1))
