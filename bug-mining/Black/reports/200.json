To confirm this, you have three options:\r\n\r\n1. Update Black's version if a newer release exists: `pip install -U black`\r\n2. Use the online formatter at <https://black.vercel.app/?version=main>, which will use\r\n   the latest main branch.\r\n3. Or run _Black_ on your machine:\r\n   - create a new virtualenv (make sure it's the same Python version);\r\n   - clone this repository;\r\n   - run `pip install -e .[d]`;\r\n   - run `pip install -r test_requirements.txt`\r\n   - make sure it's sane by running `python -m pytest`; and\r\n   - run `black` like you did last time.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n**Describe the bug**\r\n\r\nBlack cannot parse an expression with multiple unpacking operations on one line that executes fine with Python.\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\n\r\nFor example, take this code:\r\n\r\n```python\r\na = [1, 2]\r\nb = [\"3\", \"4\"]\r\n\r\nfor x in *a, *b:\r\n    print(x)\r\n\r\nc = *a, *b\r\nprint(c)\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd run it with these arguments:\r\n\r\n```sh\r\n$ black file.py --target-version py39\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe resulting error is:\r\n\r\n> error: cannot format test.py: Cannot parse: 4:9: for x in *a, *b:\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\n\r\nEssentially, nothing. The file is already formatted fine. But black shouldn't raise an error ;)\r\n\r\n**Environment**\r\n\r\n<!-- Please complete the following information: -->\r\n\r\n- Black's version: 22.1.0\r\n- OS and Python version: Python 3.9.1, Red Hat 4.8.5-44\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\n\r\nRunning the file produces the following output:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ python file.py\r\n1\r\n2\r\n3\r\n4\r\n(1, 2, '3', '4')\r\n```\r\n\r\nMicrosoft's Pylance also doesn't understand this (and the second to last line where `c` is assigned).
