Some of my own observations:\r\n\r\n> I think the relevant question for computing line length is how good, Unicode-aware code editors display these characters. So if zero-width characters are actually normally displayed as zero-width, we should count them as zero-width.\r\n\r\nThe support for EAW (i.e. single vs double width) is generally quite good. All GUI (including web) ones are very good at this. CLI editors generally rely on the terminal’s support, which is also quite universal these days, since it affects emojis as well.\r\n\r\nSupport is variant for characters with *ambigious* or *unspecified* length. with most engines displaying them as single-width (even zero-width characters). But IMO this is not a problem from a practical standpoint.\r\n\r\nPeople tend to care less (at least I do) when the line wraps too early (i.e. break at 86 instead of 88 characters), and  it’s unlikely for a source have a lot of zero-width characters in your string[*]. EAW characters, however, make the line wrap too *late*, with extremely long lines that cause line overflow or soft wrapping, both very noticible and with significant usability issues.\r\n\r\n[*]: Non-printing characters are not a good idea anyway since they are inherently hard to spot, causing difficulties in maintainance. It is more advised to use escape code instead. Combining characters should be counted as zero-width when they are combining in an ideal world, but they are nore difficult since the length depends on context. And again, this is less of a problem in practice since it only causes early wraps, not late.\r\n\r\n> I'm also concerned about whether this change could affect performance for the common case of having only normal-width characters.\r\n\r\nI understand what you’re trying to say, but this expression is slightly, um, annoying (avoiding the r word here). Hopefully you don’t really mean our native languages are not as “normal” as English? 🙂

texts using non-ASCII characters in markdown would be daily practice worldwide. One, like me, would want to lint markdown files written in non-ASCII characters.\r\n\r\nRegarding MD013, the current implementation of markdownlint seems checking character count of each line, based on regular expression. However, character width of unicode characters varies. For example, CJK characters often have double width.\r\n\r\nImagine that you configured MD013 as\r\n\r\n```console\r\n$ cat .markdownlint.yml\r\nMD013:\r\n  line_length: 40\r\n```\r\nand you have `example.md`:\r\n\r\n```markdown\r\n# An old story\r\n\r\n<!-- Line below is of length 56, so it will be warned by markdownlint. -->\r\nLong, long ago there lived, an old man and an old woman.\r\n\r\n<!-- Line below has total unicode width 70 but won't be warned as its character counts 35. -->\r\nむかしむかし，あるところに，おじいさんとおばあさんがくらしていました。\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt is expected that both lines 4 and 7 are warned by MD013. However, \r\n\r\n```console\r\n$ markdownlint example.md\r\nexample.md:4:41 MD013/line-length Line length [Expected: 40; Actual: 56]\r\n```\r\n\r\nRelated:

Hello! Thanks for submitting a PR. To help make things go a bit more\r\n     smoothly we would appreciate that you go through this template. -->\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n<!-- Good things to put here include: reasoning for the change (please link\r\n     any relevant issues!), any noteworthy (or hacky) choices to be aware of,\r\n     or what the problem resolved here looked like ... we won't mind a ranty\r\n     story :) -->\r\n\r\nThis patch changes the preview style so that string splitters respect Unicode [East Asian Width](https://www.unicode.org/reports/tr11/) property.  If you are not familiar to CJK languages it is not clear immediately.  Let me elaborate with some examples.\r\n\r\nTraditionally, East Asian characters (including punctuations) have taken up space twice than European letters and stops when they are rendered in monospace typeset.  Compare the following characters:\r\n\r\n```\r\nabcdefg.\r\n글、字。\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe characters at the first line are half-width, and the second line are full-width.  (Also note that the last character with a small circle, the East Asian period, is also full-width.)  Therefore, if we want to prevent those full-width characters to exceed the maximum columns per line, we need to count their *width* rather than the number of characters.  Again, the following characters:\r\n\r\n```\r\n글、字。\r\n```\r\n\r\nThese are just 4 characters, but their total width is 8.\r\n\r\nSuppose we want to maintain up to 4 columns per line with the following text:\r\n\r\n```\r\nabcdefg.\r\n글、字。\r\n```\r\n\r\nHow should it be then?  We want it to look like:\r\n\r\n```\r\nabcd\r\nefg.\r\n글、\r\n字。\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, Black currently turns it into like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\nabcd\r\nefg.\r\n글、字。\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt's because Black currently counts the number of characters in the line instead of measuring their width.  So, how could we measure the width?  How can we tell if a character is full- or half-width?  What if half-width characters and full-width ones are mixed in a line?  That's why Unicode defined an attribute named `East_Asian_Width`.  Unicode grouped every single character according to their width in fixed-width typeset.\r\n\r\nSo, this patch tried to change how Black measure line widths using `East_Asian_Width` attribute, and I believe it works well with full-width characters now.  However, I am not confident if I implemented things in a proper way, so please let me know if I need to adjust!\r\n\r\nAlso, I believe it partially addresses #1197, but I touched only string splitters.  Other parts probably need to be fixed as well.\r\n\r\n### Checklist - did you ...\r\n\r\n<!-- If any of the following items aren't relevant for your contribution\r\n     please still tick them so we know you've gone through the checklist.\r\n\r\n    All user-facing changes should get an entry.

seems that this extension does not handle correctly formatting strings containing emojis when formatting from vscode. Formatting the file with the black command via cli works correctly.\r\n\r\nExamples:\r\n\r\nbefore\r\n```py\r\ns = '😊'\r\nx = 'foo'\r\n```\r\n\r\nafter\r\n```py\r\ns = \"\"'\r\nx = \"foo\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nor\r\n\r\n```py\r\ns = '🤵 hi!'\r\n```\r\n\r\nafter\r\n```py\r\ns = \"🤵 hi\"'\r\n```\r\n\r\nInvestigating a bit, it seems that the positions sent back from the language server to the client count the emojis as a single character while the visual studio code editor doesn't, as for the first example the line edits relative to the line 0 are `0:4-0:5, new_text='\"'` and `0:6-0:7, new_text='\"'`, but the second one seems to replace something other than the second `'`. Tampering with the server code and setting `0:7-0:8` to the second edit fixes the problem.\r\n\r\nTested on Windows 10.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode-black-formatter/issues/395/reactions","total_count":4,"+1":3,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":1,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/vscode-black-formatter/issues/395/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/psf/black/issues/comments/3448896299","html_url":"https://github.com/psf/black/issues/1197#issuecomment-3448896299","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/psf/black/issues/1197","id":3448896299,"node_id":"IC_kwDOB3dpmM7Nkfsr","user":{"login":"cobaltt7","id":61329810,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYxMzI5ODEw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/61329810?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cobaltt7","html_url":"https://github.com/cobaltt7","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cobaltt7/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cobaltt7/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cobaltt7/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cobaltt7/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cobaltt7/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cobaltt7/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cobaltt7/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cobaltt7/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cobaltt7/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-10-26T20:15:24Z","updated_at":"2025-10-26T20:15:24Z","body":"This was fixed in #3445","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/psf/black/issues/comments/3448896299/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":1,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"cobaltt7","id":61329810,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYxMzI5ODEw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/61329810?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cobaltt7","html_url":"https://github.com/cobaltt7","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cobaltt7/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cobaltt7/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cobaltt7/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cobaltt7/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cobaltt7/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cobaltt7/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cobaltt7/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cobaltt7/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cobaltt7/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":20511843581,"node_id":"CE_lADOB3dpmM4f31fbzwAAAATGmeT9","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/psf/black/issues/events/20511843581","actor":{"login":"cobaltt7","id":61329810,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYxMzI5ODEw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/61329810?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cobaltt7","html_url":"https://github.com/cobaltt7","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cobaltt7/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cobaltt7/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cobaltt7/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cobaltt7/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cobaltt7/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cobaltt7/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cobaltt7/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cobaltt7/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cobaltt7/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2025-10-26T20:15:24Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
