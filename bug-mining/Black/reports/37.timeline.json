OK to ignore the backslashes, but it would be better if the line was split to the proper length afterwards.\r\n\r\nSince isort (https://pypi.python.org/pypi/isort) does a very good job at sorting and

effects).\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/psf/black/issues/69/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/psf/black/issues/69/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"actor":{"login":"ambv","id":55281,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1Mjgx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55281?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambv","html_url":"https://github.com/ambv","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambv/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambv/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambv/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambv/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambv/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambv/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambv/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambv/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambv/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-04-03T21:00:20Z","updated_at":"2018-04-03T21:00:20Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/psf/black/issues/98","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/psf/black","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/psf/black/issues/98/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/psf/black/issues/98/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/psf/black/issues/98/events","html_url":"https://github.com/psf/black/issues/98","id":310784927,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWUzMTA3ODQ5Mjc=","number":98,"title":"Strings
