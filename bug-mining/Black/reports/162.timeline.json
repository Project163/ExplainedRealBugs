However, given that I am unfamiliar with `black`, I don't know whether the workaround is OK (if a unit-test were added) or not.\r\n\r\nThis minimal example that I was able to produce was:\r\n```python\r\nprint \"Something\"\r\n\r\ndef bar():\r\n    \"\"\"Testing\r\n    Testing \"\"\"\r\n    pass\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe issue seems to be that, when parsing Python 2 (caused, I think, by the use of the `print` statement), the docstring node value ends up being a `bytes` rather than a `str` -- which results in the string normalization not being performed. As the docstring in the example has a trailing space that `black` removes, the equivalence check fails as a result.\r\n\r\nChanging the normalization to operate on `bytes` as well as `str`s works around the problem:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n            # Constant strings may be indented across newlines, if they are\r\n            # docstrings; fold spaces after newlines when comparing. Similarly,\r\n            # trailing and leading space may be removed.\r\n            if (\r\n                isinstance(node, ast.Constant)\r\n                and field == \"value\"\r\n                and isinstance(value, (str, bytes))\r\n            ):\r\n                regex = r\" *\\n[ \\t]*\"\r\n                replacement = \"\\n\"\r\n\r\n                if isinstance(value, bytes):\r\n                    regex = regex.encode()\r\n                    replacement = replacement.encode()\r\n\r\n                normalized = re.sub(regex, replacement, value).strip()\r\n            else:\r\n```\r\nHowever, I'm not convinced that this is the best option - ideally the value should be a `str` for both Python 2 and Python 3 parsing...\r\nI'll let someone who knows `black` better decide the best way forward - though I'm happy to convert this into a PR, if it should be the right thing to do...","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/psf/black/issues/comments/754775060/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"CiderMan","id":2737538,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3Mzc1Mzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2737538?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/CiderMan","html_url":"https://github.com/CiderMan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CiderMan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CiderMan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CiderMan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CiderMan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CiderMan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CiderMan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CiderMan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CiderMan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CiderMan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/psf/black/issues/comments/755201086","html_url":"https://github.com/psf/black/issues/1844#issuecomment-755201086","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/psf/black/issues/1844","id":755201086,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc1NTIwMTA4Ng==","user":{"login":"CiderMan","id":2737538,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3Mzc1Mzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2737538?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/CiderMan","html_url":"https://github.com/CiderMan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CiderMan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CiderMan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CiderMan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CiderMan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CiderMan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CiderMan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CiderMan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CiderMan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CiderMan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-01-06T09:54:51Z","updated_at":"2021-01-06T09:54:51Z","body":"By the way, I wonder if this would now be clearer:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n            # Constant strings may be indented across newlines, if they are\r\n            # docstrings; fold spaces after newlines when comparing.

of decorators does not appear to be consistent. Consider the following code snippet:\r\n```python\r\n@atexit.register\r\ndef _writeback_cache():\r\n    ...\r\n```\r\nSometimes this is left unchanged and sometimes is reformatted with a space between the `@` and the `atexit.register`. The reformatting seems to be stable for a single user and a single commit but differs between different users and different commit.\r\n\r\nI have not been able to reproduce this reliably but, as an example, I did a big commit that blackened all files under a given directory and, if I run `black` on the same directory today, it would reformat 12 of the ~220 files due to this issue - including some that are unchanged since the commit that was supposed to blacken them...\r\n\r\n- Version: black, version 20.8b1\r\n- OS and Python version: Windows/Python 3.6.3\r\n\r\n_Does this bug also happen on master?_\r\n\r\n> I've installed master in a venv and run it on the same directory as mentioned above. It would reformat 8 files, some of which were in the 12 that 20.8b1 would have formatted but some were not.\r\n\r\nOK, I take that back. When I actually ran master on the codebase, the changes were due to hex literals now being converted to lower case, rather than upper case. The one decorator that had been changed to have a space due to this bug, was reformatted without a space.\r\n\r\nAny idea when there is a new release planned on
