the bug**\r\n\r\nRemoval of new line in docstrings can violate the line length constraint if the last line is within two characters of the max line length value.\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce** Steps to reproduce the behavior:\r\n\r\nRun black on the following code with the default line-length constraint of 88 characters.\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef f():\r\n    \"\"\"89 123456789 123456789 123456789 123456789 123456789 123456789 123456789 12345678\r\n    \"\"\"\r\n    pass\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\n\r\nNo reformatting is performed.\r\n\r\n**Actual behavior**\r\n\r\nThe code is reformatted as shown below, which violates the max line length constraint.\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef f():\r\n    \"\"\"89 123456789 123456789 123456789 123456789 123456789 123456789 123456789 12345678\"\"\"\r\n    pass\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn a CI setup with Flake8 running after black, Flake8 throws the following error:\r\n\r\n```\r\ntest.py:2:89: E501 line too long (91 > 88 characters)\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Environment (please complete the following information):**\r\n\r\n- All versions of black from 20.8b0 up to 21.5b1 as well as main (d3670d9c6568aef270ccda3006252ee3388cf587).\r\n- Reproduced on Windows 10 & Ubuntu 18.04/20.04, Python 3.7 & 3.8\r\n\r\n**Does this bug also happen on main?**\r\n\r\nYes\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\n\r\nblack 19.10b0 does not have this behavior.\r\nThis was reported in

pointed out in #39, black inserts a space before a one-line or the summary in a multi-line docstring when it begins with a quote (\") character.  Default behavior for docformatter is to remove this space, which leads to a never-ending loop.  The newly created argument `--pre-summary-space` will retain this black-inserted space at the expense of adding a space before every docstring, which black will then remove resulting in, yet again, a never-ending loop.\r\n\r\nAdd an argument (e.g., `--black`) to make docformatter only add the space when the line begins with a quote character when the `--pre-summary-space` argument is set.  Thus, the invocation for black compatibility would be:\r\n```\r\ndocformatter --pre-summary-space

the bug**\r\n\r\nBlack is overzealous about reformatting docstrings to a single line, and can cause the resulting line to be longer than the line length limit.\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\n\r\nFor example, take this code:\r\n```python\r\ndef f():\r\n    \"\"\"89 123456789 123456789 123456789 123456789 123456789 123456789 123456789 12345678\r\n    \"\"\"\r\n```\r\nThe first line of this docstring is exactly 88 characters. After blackening this code, this results in:\r\n```python\r\ndef f():\r\n    \"\"\"89 123456789 123456789 123456789 123456789 123456789 123456789 123456789 12345678\"\"\"\r\n```\r\nThe line is now 91 characters, and flake8 complains.\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\n\r\nHonestly, I wouldn't expect black to reformat docstrings at all. But I definitely wouldn't expect it to reformat to the point where style-compliant code becomes non-style-compliant.\r\n\r\n**Environment**\r\n\r\n- Black's version: 22.10.0, main\r\n- OS and Python version: macOS 12.6, Python 3.9.13\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\n\r\nThis appears to be a regression of the same bug reported in #1632 and #2274.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/psf/black/issues/3331/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/psf/black/issues/3331/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
