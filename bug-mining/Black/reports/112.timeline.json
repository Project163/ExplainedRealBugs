Sorry you're having trouble. To expedite your experience,\r\nprovide some basics for me:\r\n\r\nOperating system: Ubuntu 16.04.6 LTS\r\nPython version: 3.7.2\r\n*Black* version: 19.3b0\r\nDoes also happen on master: yes\r\n\r\nTo answer the last question, you have two options:\r\n1. Use the online formatter at https://black.now.sh/?version=master, which will use the latest master branch.\r\n2. Or run black on your machine:\r\n    * create a new virtualenv (make sure it's the same Python version);\r\n    * clone this repository;\r\n    * run `pip install -e .`;\r\n    * make sure it's sane by running `python setup.py test`; and\r\n    * run `black` like you did last time.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/psf/black/issues/784/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/psf/black/issues/784/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":2321925847,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDIzMjE5MjU4NDc=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/psf/black/issues/events/2321925847","actor":{"login":"JelleZijlstra","id":906600,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkwNjYwMA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/906600?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra","html_url":"https://github.com/JelleZijlstra","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"2bcb8391c3ebafe9da1972f6d17ce246947465f6","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/JelleZijlstra/black/commits/2bcb8391c3ebafe9da1972f6d17ce246947465f6","created_at":"2019-05-06T19:21:06Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"actor":{"login":"JelleZijlstra","id":906600,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkwNjYwMA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/906600?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra","html_url":"https://github.com/JelleZijlstra","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-05-06T19:31:22Z","updated_at":"2019-05-06T19:31:22Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/psf/black/issues/832","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/psf/black","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/psf/black/issues/832/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/psf/black/issues/832/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/psf/black/issues/832/events","html_url":"https://github.com/psf/black/pull/832","id":440851130,"node_id":"MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0Mjc2MzA0Nzgz","number":832,"title":"add

the bug**\r\n\r\nBlack adds line breaks on tuple expansion even when the line length is under the allotted limit.\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\n\r\nGiven the following snippet:\r\n\r\n```py\r\ndef do_something(values):\r\n    ( a2, t0, t1, ) = values\r\n\r\n    j = [1,\r\n         2,\r\n         3\r\n    ]\r\n\r\n    # Dummy code follows:\r\n    if a2 < 0:\r\n        return 0\r\n    elif t1 == t0:\r\n        return 1\r\n    else:\r\n        return 2\r\n```\r\n\r\nUsing\r\n\r\n```\r\nblack test_black.py --target-version py39\r\n```\r\n\r\nBlack formats it to:\r\n\r\n```py\r\ndef do_something(values):\r\n    (\r\n        a2,\r\n        t0,\r\n        t1,\r\n    ) = values\r\n\r\n    j = [1, 2, 3]\r\n\r\n    # Dummy code follows:\r\n    if a2 < 0:\r\n        return 0\r\n    elif t1 == t0:\r\n        return 1\r\n    else:\r\n        return 2\r\n```\r\n\r\nI understand that this is probably a consequence of #656 , but I don't see this choice being described in [Black the code style](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/the_black_code_style/current_style.html). It's the opposite of the [How Black wraps lines](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/the_black_code_style/current_style.html#how-black-wraps-lines) example.\r\n\r\nHow is \r\n\r\n```py\r\n    (\r\n        a2,\r\n        t0,\r\n        t1,\r\n    ) = values\r\n```\r\n\r\nMore readable than\r\n\r\n```py\r\n    ( a2, t0, t1, ) = values\r\n```\r\n\r\nAlso:\r\n\r\n> If a data structure literal (tuple, list, set, dict) or a line of “from” imports cannot fit in the allotted length, it’s always split into one element per line.\r\n\r\nThe `    ( a2, t0, t1, ) = values` line is clearly under the allotted length, so I don't understand why the line breaks were added.\r\n\r\n**Expected Output**\r\n\r\nGiven that the line length is under the limit, I expect Black to just add parentheses and a trailing comma:\r\n\r\n```py\r\n    (a2, t0, t1,) = values\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Environment**\r\n\r\n- Black's version:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ black --version\r\nblack, 23.7.0 (compiled: yes)\r\nPython (CPython) 3.8.10\r\n```\r\n- OS and Python version:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ python3 --version\r\nPython 3.8.10\r\n\r\n$ lsb_release -a\r\nDistributor ID: Ubuntu\r\nDescription:    Ubuntu 20.04.5 LTS\r\nRelease:        20.04\r\nCodename:       focal\r\n```\r\n\r\nSame behaviour with Python 3.11.2 and Ubuntu 23.04","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/psf/black/issues/3813/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/psf/black/issues/3813/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"not_planned"}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
