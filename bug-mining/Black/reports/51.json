always found what other formatters are doing here wrong and currently Black is also doing the wrong thing.\r\n\r\n### Needs changing\r\n\r\nThe explicit PEP 8 recommendation is:\r\n\r\n**YES**:\r\n```py3\r\nham[lower + offset : upper + offset]\r\nham[: upper_fn(x) : step_fn(x)], ham[:: step_fn(x)]\r\n```\r\n\r\n~NO~:\r\n```\r\nham[lower + offset:upper + offset]\r\nham[:upper_fn(x):step_fn(x)], ham[::step_fn(x)]\r\n```\r\n\r\nEssentially, we should treat `:` as an \"operator\" inside slices when any operand of the slice includes punctuation (dots, brackets, and other math, binary or logic operators).\r\n\r\nMore examples:\r\n**YES**\r\n```py3\r\nham[lower * unit + offset * unit : upper * unit + offset * unit]\r\n```\r\n\r\n~NO~:\r\n```\r\nham[lower*unit+offset*unit : upper*unit+offset*unit]\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote that PEP 8 allows for the following that [we cannot properly enforce](https://github.com/ambv/black/issues/148):\r\n```\r\nham[lower+offset : upper+offset]\r\n```\r\n\r\nBlack won't do that because \"lower\", \"upper\", or \"offset\" can be arbitrary complexity and then operator hugging isn't improving readability anymore.\r\n\r\n### Already well formatted\r\nBlack is already formatting the other PEP 8 recommendation well:\r\n\r\n**YES**:\r\n```py3\r\nham[1:9], ham[1:9:3], ham[:9:3], ham[1::3], ham[1:9:]\r\nham[lower:upper], ham[lower:upper:], ham[lower::step]\r\n```\r\n\r\n~NO~:\r\n```\r\nham[1: 9], ham[1 :9], ham[1:9 :3]\r\nham[lower : : upper]\r\nham[ : upper]\r\n```\r\n\r\n(edited: a previous version of this issue suggested hugging operators but I since realized this cannot be performed consistently)\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"ambv","id":55281,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1Mjgx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55281?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambv","html_url":"https://github.com/ambv","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambv/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambv/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambv/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambv/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambv/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambv/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambv/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambv/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambv/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/psf/black/issues/157/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/psf/black/issues/157/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
