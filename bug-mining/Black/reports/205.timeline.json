Why was black importing an internal module?

Sorry about that.\r\n\r\nLooks like this is why:\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef patch_click() -> None:\r\n    \"\"\"Make Click not crash on Python 3.6 with LANG=C.\r\n    On certain misconfigured environments, Python 3 selects the ASCII encoding as the\r\n    default which restricts paths that it can access during the lifetime of the\r\n    application.  Click refuses to work in this scenario by raising a RuntimeError.\r\n    In case of Black the likelihood that non-ASCII characters are going to be used in\r\n    file paths is minimal since it's Python source code.  Moreover, this crash was\r\n    spurious on Python 3.7 thanks to PEP 538 and PEP 540.\r\n    \"\"\"\r\n    try:\r\n        from click import core\r\n        from click import _unicodefun\r\n    except ModuleNotFoundError:\r\n        return\r\n\r\n    for module in (core, _unicodefun):\r\n        if hasattr(module, \"_verify_python3_env\"):\r\n            module._verify_python3_env = lambda: None  #

it's just catching the wrong exception.","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/psf/black/issues/comments/1080978529/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":1},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"woodruffw","id":3059210,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwNTkyMTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3059210?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/woodruffw","html_url":"https://github.com/woodruffw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/woodruffw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/woodruffw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/woodruffw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/woodruffw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/woodruffw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/woodruffw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/woodruffw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/woodruffw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/woodruffw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"actor":{"login":"Kyle-Verhoog","id":6321485,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzMjE0ODU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6321485?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kyle-Verhoog","html_url":"https://github.com/Kyle-Verhoog","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kyle-Verhoog/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kyle-Verhoog/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kyle-Verhoog/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kyle-Verhoog/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kyle-Verhoog/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kyle-Verhoog/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kyle-Verhoog/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kyle-Verhoog/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kyle-Verhoog/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-03-28T18:10:06Z","updated_at":"2022-03-28T18:10:06Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DataDog/dd-trace-py/issues/3490","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DataDog/dd-trace-py","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DataDog/dd-trace-py/issues/3490/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DataDog/dd-trace-py/issues/3490/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DataDog/dd-trace-py/issues/3490/events","html_url":"https://github.com/DataDog/dd-trace-py/pull/3490","id":1183794633,"node_id":"PR_kwDOA6uE5s41LKTr","number":3490,"title":"chore:
