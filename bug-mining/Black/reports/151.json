However, a few lines later, I was disappointed to see `Change hex literals to upper case.`.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/psf/black/blob/6284953d07060804dcdeacf4626b76aed7a20683/src/black/__init__.py#L5158-L5168\r\n\r\nThere's one practical issue with use of upper-case hex letters, though, and that's similarity between letter `B` and digit `8`.\r\n\r\nI have seen bugs caused by this similarity in security-sensitive code, such as UTF-8/-16 decoders. Personally, I always used uppercase letters in hex numerals prior to that incident, because of the aesthetics of it; but, since then, have been switching to lowercase anywhere possible.\r\n\r\nMaybe Black would consider switching to lowercase hex letters, as well?","closed_by":{"login":"cooperlees","id":3005596,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwMDU1OTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3005596?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cooperlees","html_url":"https://github.com/cooperlees","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cooperlees/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cooperlees/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cooperlees/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cooperlees/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cooperlees/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cooperlees/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cooperlees/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cooperlees/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cooperlees/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/psf/black/issues/1692/reactions","total_count":6,"+1":5,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":1,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/psf/black/issues/1692/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
