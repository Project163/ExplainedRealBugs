issue for 2023 here: https://github.com/psf/black/issues/3407\r\n\r\nHere's what this issue is:\r\n- I've listed all the features we have enabled under `--preview`\r\n- ...in descending order of how controversial I think they are\r\n- I've also drawn a dividing line; past \"uncontroversial\" is where I feel we don't need to think twice about it\r\n- I've listed the number of digits in the diff-shade lines changed count and linked original PR\r\n- I tried to list any open issues next to the relevant preview feature, but it's possible I missed something\r\n  - <s>Issues tagged with `preview` I haven't yet associated with a feature: #3614 and #3802</s> (sorted these out–Jelle)\r\n\r\nHere's the current call to action:\r\n- Any comments / opinions / vibes on these features is very welcome\r\n- Please test your codebase with `--preview` and let us know your thoughts!\r\n- If you have a specific problem with a preview feature, especially something that feels like an implementation issue, it's best to open a separate issue (that we can then link to from here)\r\n\r\nFor many of the changes, diff-shades logs have expired. We should find a way to keep these around for longer!\r\n\r\nIt's currently November, so there's still time to make more uncontroversial changes and hopefuly iron out some issues in the not uncontroversial ones.\r\n\r\n## Not uncontroversial\r\n\r\n#### string_processing\r\n\r\nThis one is controversial, vast majority of preview style issues are related to string processing\r\nOpen issues I believe are caused by string_processing: #2334, #2314, #3466, #3497, #3409, #3424, #3428, #3210, #3410, #3747, #3665, #3663, #2553, #3855, #3802\r\n\r\n#### hug_parens_with_braces_and_square_brackets (#3964, #3992)\r\n\r\nCauses O(10000) changes, although counting lines changed is unfavourable to this change.\r\nA very substantial change in style for Black. We can't revert once it's in stable.\r\nOutstanding crash: #4036\r\n\r\n#### parenthesize_conditional_expressions (#2278)\r\n\r\nCauses O(1000) changes. Need to look at diff\r\n~Has unfortunate interactions with comments: #3555~\r\n\r\n#### wrap_long_dict_values_in_parens (#3440)\r\n\r\nCauses O(100) changes. Need to look at diff\r\n~Outstanding crash: #3758~\r\nReport of worse splitting: #3452\r\n~Unnecessary nesting: #4129~\r\nRemoves parentheses: #4158\r\n\r\n#### multiline_string_handling (#1879)\r\n\r\nCauses O(1000) changes. Need to look at diff\r\nMaybe has some synergy with `hug_parens_with_braces_and_square_brackets`.\r\nUnfortunate white space preservation: #4159\r\n\r\n#### dummy_implementations (#3796)\r\n\r\nI can't find up-to-date diff-shades, but maybe O(1000) changes\r\nRequires a change in flake8 config: #3887\r\nCan result in an extra line, but no change expected to be made: #3872\r\n\r\n#### prefer_splitting_right_hand_side_of_assignments (#3368)\r\n\r\nCauses O(100) changes.\r\n\r\n#### hex_codes_in_unicode_sequences (#2916)\r\n\r\nCauses O(100) changes\r\nOpen issue whether lowercase or uppercase is better #3568\r\n\r\n#### allow_empty_first_line_before_new_block_or_comment (#3967)\r\n\r\nCauses O(1) changes.\r\nThis change itself is fine, but it's related to a controversial and churn causing change in 2023 style. I think we should probably revert that 2023 change; I posted a longer issue about this over here https://github.com/psf/black/issues/4043\r\n\r\n#### parenthesize_long_type_hints (#3899)\r\n\r\nCauses O(100) changes\r\n\r\n#### module_docstring_newlines (#3932)\r\n\r\nCauses O(100) changes\r\n\r\n## Uncontroversial\r\n\r\n#### respect_magic_trailing_comma_in_return_type (#3916)\r\n\r\nO(10) changes.\r\nShouldn't affect existing formatting too much, unless there's a buggy trailing comma\r\nAll changes in diff-shades are incidental, but are good and what you'd expect Black to do\r\n\r\n#### no_blank_line_before_class_docstring (#3692)\r\n\r\nO(100) changes. Makes consistent with function behaviour\r\nBlank lines have been a little controversial, but I think this should be totally fine\r\n\r\n#### wrap_multiple_context_managers_in_parens (#3489)\r\n\r\nO(100) changes. Naively, looks great to me\r\n\r\n#### fix_power_op_line_length (#3942)\r\n\r\nO(10) changes. A bug fix\r\n\r\n#### add_trailing_comma_consistently (#3393)\r\n\r\nO(1) changes. A bug fix\r\n\r\n#### skip_magic_trailing_comma_in_subscript (#3209)\r\n\r\nO(1) changes. A bug fix, affects a non-default option\r\n\r\n#### blank_line_after_nested_stub_class (#3564)\r\n\r\nOnly affects stubs, adds some blank lines in an uncommon case\r\n\r\n#### blank_line_between_nested_and_def_stub_file (#3862)\r\n\r\nOnly affects stubs, adds some blank lines in even less common case\r\n\r\n#### accept_raw_docstrings (#3947)\r\n\r\nO(1) changes. Just a bug fix\r\n\r\n#### long_case_block_line_splitting (#4024)\r\n\r\n0 changes. Seems strictly good\r\n\r\n#### walrus_subscript (#3823)\r\n\r\n0 changes. Straightforward style change\r\n\r\n#### improved_async_statements_handling  (#3609)\r\n\r\n0 changes. More consistent\r\n\r\n#### single_line_format_skip_with_multiple_comments (#3959)\r\n\r\n0 changes.

`--preview` mode is supposed to give a preview of what next year's stable style will look like. But for the last few years, it hasn't been able to do that job, because `--preview` includes experimental string processing, which produces numerous bugs and likely again won't make it into the 2024 stable style (#4042). Several other current preview features likely won't make it into the 2024 stable style.\r\n\r\nI propose to add a new style, `--unstable`. The idea would be that `--preview` is only for new style features that we currently think would make it into next year's stable style, and `--unstable` is for new features that we would like to eventually stabilize, but that are currently still buggy. `--unstable` would include all `--preview` features. This way, `--preview` will truly be a preview.\r\n\r\nConcrete rules:\r\n- Any preview feature that leads to new crashes (e.g., stability bugs) should be demoted to `--unstable` until the issue is fixed.\r\n- Similarly, if a preview feature is shown to lead to bad formatting in some cases (in our judgment as maintainers), we demote the feature to unstable. For example, #3555 should make us demote the related preview feature to unstable.\r\n- New preview features merged in November or December would by default go into `--unstable`, so that there is enough time for the ecosystem to try out the new feature. We can make exceptions for sufficiently simple and uncontroversial changes. We'd move these features into `--preview` once the new year starts.\r\n\r\nAlternative solutions considered:\r\n\r\n- We could simply be more aggressive in deleting preview features that cause trouble. I'd personally be hesitant to do this though, especially for features that have had significant effort invested into them: it will be a lot more effort to apply them to the Black codebase again later once the original issue is fixed. However, I do think we should delete unstable features that have remained in that state for too long.\r\n- We could move unstable features out of `--preview`, but not add a separate `--unstable` flag. Instead, we could add a private flag like `-X string_processing` to enable individual preview features. This would allow more targeted testing, but it opens the door to more configurability than I'd like, and might lead to users expecting us to continue supporting such fine-grained configuration control.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/psf/black/issues/4093/reactions","total_count":8,"+1":8,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/psf/black/issues/4093/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/psf/black/issues/comments/1870860827","html_url":"https://github.com/psf/black/issues/3555#issuecomment-1870860827","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/psf/black/issues/3555","id":1870860827,"node_id":"IC_kwDOB3dpmM5vgxIb","user":{"login":"hauntsaninja","id":12621235,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNjIxMjM1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12621235?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja","html_url":"https://github.com/hauntsaninja","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-12-28T06:18:13Z","updated_at":"2023-12-28T06:18:13Z","body":"Got
