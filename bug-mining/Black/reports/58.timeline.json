the style change**\r\n\r\nThe square brackets of multi-line lists that are arguments of a function call should appear on the same lines as the function call's surrounding parentheses.\r\n\r\n**Examples in the current _Black_ style**\r\n\r\n```python\r\nx = np.array(\r\n    [\r\n        [0, 1, 2, 3, 4],\r\n        [5, 6, 7, 8, 9],\r\n    ]\r\n)\r\n\r\nx = np.array(\r\n

in Typescript and similar languages. It is also an elegant style for `numpy` array declarations, as shown above. In fact, it seems that many other numpy users have also been troubled by the way that black currently formats numpy arrays. For instance, the following Stack Overflow question has been viewed 300 times:\r\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/questions/61021465/formatting-numpy-arrays-with-black/365102\r\n\r\nThis rule should of course not be followed in cases where the non-list arguments exceed line length or when there is more than one multi-line list as an argument. In such cases, the current black style is much more reasonable.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/psf/black/issues/2071/reactions","total_count":4,"+1":4,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/psf/black/issues/2071/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
