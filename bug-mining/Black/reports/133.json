I ran across this issue while trying to make a script that asks before applying changes. (Obviously I could reapply the changes by running `black` again so it's not too important, but being able to cache the diff so the apply is faster would be nice, and avoid a race condition if someone edits a file in the middle)\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce issue:\r\n\r\n```\r\n# setup\r\ngit init black-repro && cd black-repro && echo \"x = '1'\" > foo.py\r\n\r\nblack --diff . | git apply\r\n# error: patch failed: foo.py:1\r\n# error: foo.py: patch does not apply\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe problem is that the diff includes an extra newline at the end compared to what git expects:\r\n```\r\nblack --diff . | sed s/1,2/1,1/g | grep -Ev '^ $' | git apply\r\n# works\r\n```","closed_by":{"login":"JelleZijlstra","id":906600,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkwNjYwMA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/906600?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra","html_url":"https://github.com/JelleZijlstra","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/psf/black/issues/526/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/psf/black/issues/526/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
