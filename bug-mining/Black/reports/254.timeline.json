Description\r\nI've encountered an issue where the Black formatter does not format Python files in git folders. The formatter works as expected on Python files in non-Git folders, but once a folder is initialized as a Git repository, newly created Python files within that folder are not formatted. Deleting the `.git` folder restores Black's functionality. \r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n1. Create a new folder and place a Python file inside. Confirm that Black formats this file correctly in VS Code.\r\n2. Initialize the folder as a Git repository using `git init`.\r\n3. Create another Python file in the Git-initialized folder. Observe that Black does not format this new file.\r\n4. Delete the `.git` folder from the project directory.\r\n5. Create another Python file and observe that Black now formats it correctly.\r\n\r\n### Expected Behavior\r\nBlack should format Python files regardless of the presence of a Git repository in the project folder.\r\n\r\n### Actual Behavior\r\nBlack does not format Python files in folders that have been initialized as Git repositories.\r\n\r\n### Error Messages\r\n- Upon initializing a Git repository and attempting to format a Python file, there are no explicit error messages from Black indicating a failure to format. The functionality silently fails. The problem is that no Python files are found.\r\n\r\n2024-02-08 15:41:41.341 [info] [Trace - 3:41:41 PM] Sending request 'textDocument/formatting - (8)'.\r\n2024-02-08 15:41:41.344 [info] [Trace - 3:41:41 PM] Received notification 'window/logMessage'.\r\n2024-02-08 15:41:41.344 [info] c:\\Users\\yilma\\AppData\\Local\\Programs\\Python\\Python311\\python.exe -m black --skip-string-normalization --stdin-filename c:\\Files\\Coding\\Python\\Neuro\\testing\\testing_new.py -\r\n2024-02-08 15:41:41.345 [info] [Trace - 3:41:41 PM] Received notification 'window/logMessage'.\r\n2024-02-08 15:41:41.345 [info] CWD formatter: c:\\Files\\Coding\\Python\\Neuro\\testing\r\n2024-02-08 15:41:41.348 [info] [Trace - 3:41:41 PM] Received notification 'window/logMessage'.\r\n2024-02-08 15:41:41.348 [info] No Python files are present to be formatted.

If further information or testing is required, I'm happy to provide it.\r\n\r\nEdit: Switching to Black v2023.6.0 solved my

relates to #4015, #4161 and the behaviour of os.getcwd()\r\n\r\nBlack is a big user of pathlib and as such loves doing `.resolve()`, since for a long time it was the only good way of getting an absolute path in pathlib. However, this has two problems:\r\n\r\nThe first minor problem is performance, e.g. in #3751 I (safely) got rid of a bunch of `.resolve()` which made Black 40% faster on cached runs.\r\n\r\nThe second more important problem is that always resolving symlinks results in unintuitive exclusion behaviour. For instance, a gitignored symlink should never alter formatting of your actual code. This kind of thing was reported by users a few times.\r\n\r\nIn #3846, I improved the exclusion rule logic for symlinks in `gen_python_files` and everything was good.\r\n\r\nBut `gen_python_files` isn't enough, there's also `get_sources`, which handles user specified paths directly (instead of files Black discovers). So in #4015, I made a very similar change to #3846 for `get_sources`, and this is where some problems began.\r\n\r\nThe core issue was the line:\r\n```\r\nroot_relative_path = path.absolute().relative_to(root).as_posix()\r\n```\r\nThe first issue is that despite root being computed from user inputs, we call `.resolve()` while computing root (likely unecessarily). Which means that `path` may not actually be relative to `root`. So I started off this PR trying to fix that, when I ran into the second issue. Which is that `os.getcwd()` (as called by `os.path.abspath` or `Path.absolute` or `Path.cwd`) also often resolves symlinks!\r\n```\r\n>>> import os\r\n>>> os.environ.get(\"PWD\")\r\n'/Users/shantanu/dev/black/symlink/bug'\r\n>>> os.getcwd()\r\n'/Users/shantanu/dev/black/actual/bug'\r\n```\r\nThis also meant that the breakage often would not show up when input relative paths.\r\n\r\nThis doesn't affect `gen_python_files` / #3846 because things are known to be relative to `root` and always absolute.\r\n\r\nAnyway, it looks like #4161 fixed the crash by just swallowing the error and ignoring the file. Instead, we should just try to compute the actual relative path. I think this PR should be quite safe, but we could also consider reverting some of the previous changes; the associated issues weren't too popular.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, I think there's still behaviour that can be improved and I kind of want to make larger changes, but maybe I'll save that for if we do something like #3952\r\n\r\nFixes #4205, fixes #4209, original report in
