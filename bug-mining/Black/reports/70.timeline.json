It beats hours of bikeshedding. [StandardJS](https://standardjs.com) has a lot of the same forces acting on it in the Javascript world and they've also had to stick to their guns against many who disagree. I use both, and honestly, it's like an hour and its formatting becomes second nature. My pairing-partner and I spent last week with black (I've just activated it as part of CI), and it's fine. Everything is fine. The maintainers of this project listen to reason but not opinions when deciding a direction, what better principles can we really ask for?\r\n\r\nAs a matter of practicality, if you do want to use black, have you considered not running it against the entire codebase but limit it to specific folders? With a tiered rollout, you can slowly subsume folders instead of having to orchestrate a big all-or-nothing effort.","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/psf/black/issues/comments/379911168/reactions","total_count":5,"+1":4,"-1":1,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"gaggle","id":2316447,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMTY0NDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2316447?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaggle","html_url":"https://github.com/gaggle","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaggle/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaggle/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaggle/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaggle/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaggle/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaggle/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaggle/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaggle/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gaggle/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":1564912316,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MTU2NDkxMjMxNg==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/psf/black/issues/events/1564912316","actor":{"login":"bofm","id":3646419,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2NDY0MTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3646419?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bofm","html_url":"https://github.com/bofm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bofm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bofm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bofm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bofm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bofm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bofm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bofm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bofm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bofm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-04-09T22:17:51Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":1564912318,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDE1NjQ5MTIzMTg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/psf/black/issues/events/1564912318","actor":{"login":"bofm","id":3646419,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2NDY0MTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3646419?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bofm","html_url":"https://github.com/bofm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bofm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bofm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bofm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bofm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bofm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bofm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bofm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bofm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bofm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-04-09T22:17:51Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/psf/black/issues/comments/379994355","html_url":"https://github.com/psf/black/issues/118#issuecomment-379994355","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/psf/black/issues/118","id":379994355,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM3OTk5NDM1NQ==","user":{"login":"kalekseev","id":367259,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2NzI1OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/367259?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kalekseev","html_url":"https://github.com/kalekseev","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kalekseev/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kalekseev/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kalekseev/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kalekseev/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kalekseev/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kalekseev/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kalekseev/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kalekseev/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kalekseev/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-04-10T06:56:25Z","updated_at":"2018-04-10T06:56:25Z","body":"Option for quotes looks like a simple thing to add to black, if a lot of people argue about that why don't? Why we can have width size option but can't have quote option? Even if you look at the pr it was originally with single quotes by default with argument - it's simpler to type and then switched to double quotes because `'` char can be added and quotes will be swapped to `\"` (though now if `\"` char added to the string the opposite will happen). Tab width, line width and quotes where the first options that were added to prettier https://prettier.io/docs/en/options.html (though authors claim that it's opinionated code formatter with minimal set of options as black do).\r\n\r\n@bofm overall even if black won't accept option and it crucial for your project you can fork black and apply code from https://github.com/ambv/black/pull/75 when it

is both a formatter and a code style. One of the core tenets of this project is that all blackened code looks the same. This is why I will never add configurable soft tab width, or identation with hard tabs.\r\n\r\nHaving options is a burden to the user and a slippery slope to introduce more and more. Case in point: you're already using `--line-length` as an argument to add something else. The more options, the bigger the need for a configuration file.\r\n\r\nWe chose to standardize on double quotes because:\r\n* standardizing on one makes sense; and\r\n* standardizing on double quotes makes *more* sense than single quotes.\r\n\r\nI mostly wanted the former and didn't care much which quote is going to be the one we choose. Over the course of designing this with @carljm and @zsol, they convinced me that double quotes *are* a better option. So this is what Black does now. Shouldn't it be reassuring to users to know that what Black does is informed by rational arguments?\r\n\r\nI didn't hear any arguments here that would tell me why single quotes are preferable. \"This is what we used to do\" doesn't work, Black is bound to be disruptive when adopted. \"It's easier to type\" is something that I myself said and this was debunked (it's not easier on *all* keyboard layouts, and more importantly you can keep typing whatever you want and Black will convert it for you).\r\n\r\nI'll keep this open because maybe somebody will appear and communicate clearly why an option for this is required. Unless it's strictly necessary, Black won't introduce it.\r\n\r\nPS. While forking is always an option in a MIT-licensed project, I felt like suggesting this on my issue tracker was hostile.
