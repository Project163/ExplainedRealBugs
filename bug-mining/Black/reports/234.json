To confirm this, you have three options:\r\n\r\n1. Update Black's version if a newer release exists: `pip install -U black`\r\n2. Use the online formatter at <https://black.vercel.app/?version=main>, which will use\r\n   the latest main branch.\r\n3. Or run _Black_ on your machine:\r\n   - create a new virtualenv (make sure it's the same Python version);\r\n   - clone this repository;\r\n   - run `pip install -e .[d]`;\r\n   - run `pip install -r test_requirements.txt`\r\n   - make sure it's sane by running `python -m pytest`; and\r\n   - run `black` like you did last time.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n**Describe the bug**\r\n\r\nWhen you have a docstring and add a \\ at the end of the line to get a line break black can't deal with it. \r\n<!-- A clear and concise description of what the bug is. -->\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nMinimal steps to reproduce the behavior with source code and Black's configuration.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nFor example, take this code:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nclass Database:\r\n    \"\"\"\r\n    ## Database Base Class\r\n    The custom ORM specificaly created for the [gitlab-audit project](https://gitlab.itwm.fraunhofer.de/it-linux/gitlab-audit).\r\n    Provides a lot of functions to interact with the database in a pythonic, easy and\r\n    fast way.\r\n    \"\"\"\r\n    def __init__(self):\r\n        ...\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt works completely fine(im on python version 3.9.7).
