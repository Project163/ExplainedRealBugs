If the class body ends with a function definition with ellipsis, it fails to recognize to add the blank line.\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\n\r\nFor example, take this code and add it to a `file.pyi` stub file:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nclass TopLevel:\r\n    class Nested1:\r\n        foo: int\r\n        def bar(self): ...\r\n    field = 1\r\n\r\n    class Nested2:\r\n        def bar(self): ...\r\n        foo: int\r\n    field = 1\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd run it with these arguments:\r\n\r\n```sh\r\n$ black file.pyi\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe resulting code is:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nclass TopLevel:\r\n    class Nested1:\r\n        foo: int\r\n        def bar(self): ...\r\n    field = 1\r\n\r\n    class Nested2:\r\n        def bar(self): ...\r\n        foo: int\r\n\r\n    field = 1\r\n```\r\n\r\nNotice that the blank line is added only after `Nested2` and not after `Nested`.\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\n\r\nExpected the blank line to be added after both `Nested1` and `Nested2`.\r\n\r\n**Environment**\r\n\r\n- Black's version: `24.1a1`\r\n- OS and Python version: MacOS/Python 3.11.3\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\n\r\nThe problem seems to be the first `if` condition here:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/psf/black/blob/8fec1c30855890cc9cfce5ae6d633a1c1a21d724/src/black/lines.py#L632-L641\r\n\r\nI think the solution would be to switch the condition such that the `elif` is checked first.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"hauntsaninja","id":12621235,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNjIxMjM1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12621235?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja","html_url":"https://github.com/hauntsaninja","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/psf/black/issues/4113/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/psf/black/issues/4113/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
