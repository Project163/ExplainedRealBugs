following the `#!` header to provide default configuration parameters for a batch scheduler.  Unfortunately, these tools don't support a pep8 compatible `# SBATCH` or `# PBS` syntax.\r\n\r\nApplying black to a script with `#SBATCH` and `#PBS` directives silently breaks these tools, in that:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n#!/usr/bin/env python\r\n#SBATCH --exclusive\r\n[...]\r\n```\r\n\r\nis reformatted as:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n#!/usr/bin/env python\r\n# SBATCH --exclusive\r\n[...]\r\n```\r\n\r\ncausing the `--exclusive` directive to be ignored by SLURM.\r\n\r\nAs the directive *must* follow the shebang and *must not* have a space between `#` and `SBATCH`. As such a `# fmt: off` escape hatche isn't a viable solution and (interestingly) don't prevent block comment reformatting in black's current implementation.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/psf/black/issues/1024/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/psf/black/issues/1024/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"not_planned"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/psf/black/issues/comments/1525651843","html_url":"https://github.com/psf/black/issues/1245#issuecomment-1525651843","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/psf/black/issues/1245","id":1525651843,"node_id":"IC_kwDOB3dpmM5a75mD","user":{"login":"randolf-scholz","id":39696536,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5Njk2NTM2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/39696536?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/randolf-scholz","html_url":"https://github.com/randolf-scholz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/randolf-scholz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/randolf-scholz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/randolf-scholz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/randolf-scholz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/randolf-scholz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/randolf-scholz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/randolf-scholz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/randolf-scholz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/randolf-scholz/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-04-27T12:57:17Z","updated_at":"2023-04-27T12:57:17Z","body":"Same issue here: [Playground link](https://black.vercel.app/?version=stable&state=_Td6WFoAAATm1rRGAgAhARYAAAB0L-Wj4APJAR5dAD2IimZxl1N_WmXTgpK-XrCPZWm7qAsMbhzDJVEjRoaOZH2kauMY8f27A5mrLgR8hceheIaKmkApwj38buFAkZ3aUh1kpo7CpaQfR8npJlkAt8QNHUprsX_9RpiIZa-rxGrZXW-MZAZYU--_J-pZNeWKPUr3P0fCRzKgihcG-waeY9YM0ei4ppBjAclHO83EGbHr_md5vl6AT0KqzR8sy90kkvQ6AkaZCYNqyywzgyMXBWGqrSTZE2bjn7aEUCAWW76AimOYwvUyolUMLPC6r_R7of6yjMM-pphp3S-aF7UKitmyOgAgMHjgfsZcM5OGlEtYYk4rzbqRx8-Phm16QbmFLkjJXS7NURzkvsX3zDbAFzlBumG_5sFX8nM1izQAAAD6l_LAh63B_gABugLKBwAASa97HrHEZ_sCAAAAAARZWg==)\r\n\r\n## Input\r\n\r\n```python\r\nrawdata_schema = {\r\n    #
