To confirm this, you have three options:\r\n\r\n1. Update Black's version if a newer release exists: `pip install -U black`\r\n2. Use the online formatter at <https://black.vercel.app/?version=main>, which will use\r\n   the latest main branch.\r\n3. Or run _Black_ on your machine:\r\n   - create a new virtualenv (make sure it's the same Python version);\r\n   - clone this repository;\r\n   - run `pip install -e .[d]`;\r\n   - run `pip install -r test_requirements.txt`\r\n   - make sure it's sane by running `python -m pytest`; and\r\n   - run `black` like you did last time.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n**Describe the bug**\r\n\r\nWhen black encounters access of a `.type` attribute inside brackets, inside a switch statement, it thinks that it is invalid syntax, even though python 3.11 executes it just fine.\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nMinimal steps to reproduce the behavior with source code and Black's configuration.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nFor example, take this code:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nclass SomeClass:\r\n    type = \"\"\r\n\r\n\r\nmatch (SomeClass.type):\r\n    case _:\r\n        print(\"Hello there ...\")\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd run it with these arguments:\r\n\r\n```sh\r\n$ pipx run --python python3.11 --spec=black==23.7.0 black --target-version py311 --diff file.py\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe resulting error is:\r\n\r\n> error: cannot format file.py: Cannot parse: 5:0: match (SomeClass.type):\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\n\r\nIt should leave the file unchanged or format it, as black 23.3.0 leaves it unchanged, and it is indeed valid syntax:\r\n\r\n```console\r\n$ python3.11 --version\r\nPython 3.11.4\r\n$ python3.11 file.py\r\nHello there ...\r\n$ pipx run --python python3.11 --spec=black==23.3.0 black --target-version py311 --diff file.py\r\n⚠️  black is already on your PATH and installed at /home/iwana/.local/bin/black. Downloading and running anyway.\r\nAll done! ✨ 🍰 ✨\r\n1 file would be left unchanged.\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n**Environment**\r\n\r\n<!-- Please complete the following information: -->\r\n\r\n- Black's version: 23.3.0\r\n- OS and Python version: Linux/Python 3.11.4\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"hauntsaninja","id":12621235,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNjIxMjM1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12621235?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja","html_url":"https://github.com/hauntsaninja","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/psf/black/issues/3790/reactions","total_count":3,"+1":3,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/psf/black/issues/3790/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
