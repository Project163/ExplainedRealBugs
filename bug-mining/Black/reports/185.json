Some questions we should document the answer to:\r\n\r\n- When does Black accept formatting changes? How is the decision to change formatting made?\r\n- What are the guarantees Black wants to continue making? When will we make exceptions to the AST safety guarantee? (XREF: #2150)\r\n- As a user, what should I expect when upgrading to a new version of Black?\r\n- How will this change when we have a \"stable\" release? Will anything change?\r\n\r\nThe answers to these questions should be in the documentation. Feel free to respond to this issue with other similar questions.","closed_by":{"login":"ambv","id":55281,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1Mjgx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55281?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambv","html_url":"https://github.com/ambv","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambv/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambv/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambv/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambv/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambv/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambv/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambv/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambv/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambv/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/psf/black/issues/2394/reactions","total_count":18,"+1":9,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":6,"rocket":3,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/psf/black/issues/2394/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
