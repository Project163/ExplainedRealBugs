the bug**\r\nChanges introduced to cache key calculations by #4096 made Black unusable with cache dir located on [eCryptfs](https://launchpad.net/ecryptfs) container which limits the maximum file names to 143 characters. eCryptfs is usually used to protect user home directories, where the default `.cache/black` location is created.\r\n\r\n#4096 added another sha256 hexdigest to the cache file names which now overflow the 143 characters limit.\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\nSet up and mount eCryptfs directory, for example you can follow this guide: https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/ECryptfs#Setup_&_mounting\r\n\r\nIf the directory is not your home directory, set `BLACK_CACHE_DIR` so that it's pointing to the mounted unencrypted directory.\r\n\r\nThen take this `code.py`:\r\n```python\r\n42\r\n```\r\nand try to format it **twice**, because the first call doesn't seem to create cache:\r\n```sh\r\n$ export BLACK_CACHE_DIR=/optionally/set/path/to/cache/on/mounted/ecryptf/if/its/not/your/home\r\n$ black file.py\r\n$ black file.py\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe resulting error is:\r\n```\r\nerror: cannot format file.py: [Errno 36] File name too long: '/home/rf/black-cache/24.1.0/cache.-.88.1.0.0.0.1.e3b0c44298fc1c149afbf4c8996fb92427ae41e4649b934ca495991b7852b855.0.e3b0c44298fc1c149afbf4c8996fb92427ae41e4649b934ca495991b7852b855.pickle'\r\n\r\nOh no! 💥 💔 💥\r\n1 file failed to reformat.\r\n```\r\nwhere `/home/rf/black-cache` was the value of `BLACK_CACHE_DIR` in my case.\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nReformat should work despite cache creation issues and/or cache should be reworked, for example by introducing multi-level cache directories if all the current information has to be retained. \r\n\r\n**Environment**\r\n\r\n<!-- Please complete the following information: -->\r\n\r\n- Black's version: 24.1.0\r\n- OS and Python version: Linux/python3.11.6\r\n\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\n\r\nMax length of the filename for the given directory can be verified with `getconf`, for example:\r\n```\r\n$ getconf NAME_MAX ~/black-cache\r\n143\r\n$ getconf NAME_MAX /\r\n255\r\n```\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/psf/black/issues/4174/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/psf/black/issues/4174/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"not_planned"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/psf/black/issues/comments/1912233844","html_url":"https://github.com/psf/black/issues/4172#issuecomment-1912233844","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/psf/black/issues/4172","id":1912233844,"node_id":"IC_kwDOB3dpmM5x-l90","user":{"login":"JelleZijlstra","id":906600,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkwNjYwMA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/906600?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra","html_url":"https://github.com/JelleZijlstra","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-01-26T15:17:03Z","updated_at":"2024-01-26T15:17:03Z","body":"Thanks
