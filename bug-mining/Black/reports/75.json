then again, the string here is multiline and thus from perspective of the opening line would only be 3 chars long?)\r\n\r\nOriginal pre-black:\r\n\r\n``` python\r\nfor key in \"\"\"                           \r\n    hostname                             \r\n    port                                 \r\n    username                             \r\n\"\"\".split():                             \r\n    if key in self.connect_kwargs:       \r\n        raise ValueError(err.format(key))\r\n```\r\n\r\nAs before, black 18.4a4 makes no changes, but 18.5b0 turns it into:\r\n\r\n``` python\r\nfor (                                    \r\n    key                                  \r\n) in (                                   \r\n    \"\"\"                                  \r\n    hostname                             \r\n    port                                 \r\n    username                             \r\n\"\"\".split()                              \r\n):                                       \r\n    if key in self.connect_kwargs:       \r\n        raise ValueError(err.format(key))\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou can see that both the `x` and `y` clauses in the `for x in y` expression have become needlessly parenthesized. (The body of the `for` is untouched and just there for clarity.)","closed_by":{"login":"ambv","id":55281,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1Mjgx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55281?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambv","html_url":"https://github.com/ambv","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambv/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambv/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambv/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambv/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambv/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambv/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambv/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambv/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambv/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/psf/black/issues/232/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/psf/black/issues/232/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
