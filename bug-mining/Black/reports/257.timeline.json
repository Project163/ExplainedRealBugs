Description\r\n\r\n<!-- Good things to put here include: reasoning for the change (please link\r\n     any relevant issues!), any noteworthy (or hacky) choices to be aware of,\r\n     or what the problem resolved here looked like ... we won't mind a ranty\r\n     story :) -->\r\n\r\nThis fixes #4264. The issue was that the empty last line does not count as a line to `adjusted_lines` because it is not in the list returned by `str.splitlines`. Since `adjusted_lines` is only called on the second pass of `_format_str_once` in `format_str`, the first pass would format the code correctly, then the \"invalid\" line would get removed from `lines`, and the second pass would format the whole code.\r\n\r\nI added a small change to `adjusted_lines` to cap the end value of any line tuple. For example, `--line-ranges 1-100` gets reduced to `(1, 4)` if the code is only four lines long.\r\nOne could change `if end > original_line_count` to `if end == original_line_count + 1` to only allow this one additional line, but I think allowing an oversized range to just cover the rest of the code is not surprising behavior, slices act similarly.\r\n\r\nI also added a call to `adjusted_lines` with the unmodified source code before the first pass of `_format_str_once`. This is an additional computational expense but ensures consistency.\r\n\r\n### Checklist - did you ...\r\n\r\n<!-- If any of the following items aren't relevant for your contribution\r\n     please still tick them so we know you've gone through the checklist.\r\n\r\n    All user-facing changes should get an entry.
