removes all but one usage of the `regex` dependency. Tricky bits included:\r\n- A bug in test_black.py where we were incorrectly using a character range. Fix also submitted separately in #2643.\r\n- `tokenize.py` was the original use case for regex (#1047). The important bit is that we rely on `\\w` to match anything valid in an identifier, and `re` fails to match a few characters as part of identifiers. My solution is to instead match all characters *except* those we know to mean something else in Python: whitespace and ASCII punctuation. This will make Black able to parse some invalid Python programs, like those that contain non-ASCII punctuation in the place of an identifier, but that seems fine to me.\r\n- One import of `regex` remains, in `trans.py`. We use a recursive regex to parse f-strings, and only `regex` supports that. I haven't thought of a better fix there (except maybe writing a manual parser), so I'm leaving that for now.\r\n\r\nMy goal is to remove the `regex` dependency to reduce the risk of breakage due to dependencies and make life easier for users on platforms without wheels.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/psf/black/issues/2644/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":1,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/psf/black/issues/2644/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/psf/black/issues/comments/1023886777","html_url":"https://github.com/psf/black/issues/2651#issuecomment-1023886777","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/psf/black/issues/2651","id":1023886777,"node_id":"IC_kwDOB3dpmM49B0W5","user":{"login":"JelleZijlstra","id":906600,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkwNjYwMA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/906600?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra","html_url":"https://github.com/JelleZijlstra","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-01-28T04:56:28Z","updated_at":"2022-01-28T04:56:28Z","body":"This no longer crashes on master.
