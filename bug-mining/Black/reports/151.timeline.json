PR onto black. Please tell me if i did something wrong according to your ordinary rules.\n\nThe issue, #1692, argues whether we/you should \"simply\" do this, as it might impact source code of a large set of users, however you can either merge it if you like it or wait if not. :) Please write me if I can do anything in that regard.\n\nI created two seperate commits:\n- Made hex lower case\n- Refactored numeric formatting section\n\nThis was done to seperate the two focus points, the first one solves the issue, whereas the second adds a bit of refactoring to that part of the code. Whether my version has a higher code quality or not, is definitely subjective, so please ignore it and cherry-pick if you dislike it :) \n\nI am looking forward to contributing to black, long time user, and all that, so I hope you like it. I'll try to do something once in a while - Am doing this as part of hacktoberfest though, so if you can either label it `hacktoberfest-accepted` or merge it before the end of the month, that will be great ;) I feel super cheap writing that, but i am trying to pimp my bike with a yearly sticker from hacktoberfest, and this month is running a bit short. If any changes are needed, I'll gladly make those :) \n\nThank you!\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/psf/black/issues/1775/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":2,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/psf/black/issues/1775/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/psf/black/issues/comments/713688240","html_url":"https://github.com/psf/black/issues/1692#issuecomment-713688240","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/psf/black/issues/1692","id":713688240,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDcxMzY4ODI0MA==","user":{"login":"C0DK","id":9048078,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkwNDgwNzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9048078?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0DK","html_url":"https://github.com/C0DK","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0DK/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0DK/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0DK/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0DK/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0DK/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0DK/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0DK/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0DK/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0DK/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-10-21T16:10:44Z","updated_at":"2020-10-21T18:58:48Z","body":"There we go - created a PR. if you do appreciate it, please label it with `hacktoberfest-accepted` so i can get a sticker on my cyberbike ( :stuck_out_tongue: ) \r\n\r\nI would also argue, as a user, that the change is minor, and as we are using black to not really think about formatting, it will simply happen in the background i guess.
