Description\r\nHugging power operators had a bug, where operators that end up hugging were still counted as not hugging when deciding to split the line. The bug is described [here](https://github.com/psf/black/issues/3889). The whole issue is a bit circular as we need to know the line length before we start to apply transformations. Calculating the hugging of power operators at the beginning of `transform_line` seems to do the trick. Ideally the `hug_power_op` transform would be done only once, but switching the order of transforms broke a lot of other places, so I don't know if there's any other good options here.\r\n\r\n###
