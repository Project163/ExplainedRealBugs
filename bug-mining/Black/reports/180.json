So in my automation I can always pull Docker image related to the newest released version of Black.\r\n\r\n**Environment (please complete the following information):**\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n**Does this bug also happen on main?**\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"cooperlees","id":3005596,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwMDU1OTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3005596?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cooperlees","html_url":"https://github.com/cooperlees","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cooperlees/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cooperlees/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cooperlees/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cooperlees/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cooperlees/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cooperlees/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cooperlees/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cooperlees/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cooperlees/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/psf/black/issues/2373/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/psf/black/issues/2373/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
