system: Mac OS\r\nPython version: 3.6.4\r\nBlack version: 18.3a3\r\nDoes also happen on master: yes\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nBlack joins long import statements, like in this example:\r\n\r\n```\r\n-from flask import Blueprint, Flask, _request_ctx_stack, abort, \\\r\n-    appcontext_pushed, current_app, g, render_template, request, \\\r\n-    request_started\r\n+from flask import Blueprint, Flask, _request_ctx_stack, abort, appcontext_pushed, current_app, g, render_template, request, request_started\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn this case, and unlike in issue https://github.com/ambv/black/issues/67 , it's OK to ignore the backslashes, but it would be better if the line was split to the proper length afterwards.\r\n\r\nSince isort (https://pypi.python.org/pypi/isort) does a very good job at sorting and formatting imports, it's not a big deal if one is willing to run `isort` after `black`. OTOH, since Black aims at providing an integrated solution, Black should probably do the splitting (and leave the sorting to isort, since this can have side effects).\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/psf/black/issues/69/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/psf/black/issues/69/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/psf/black/issues/comments/375701069","html_url":"https://github.com/psf/black/issues/67#issuecomment-375701069","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/psf/black/issues/67","id":375701069,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM3NTcwMTA2OQ==","user":{"login":"sethmlarson","id":18519037,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NTE5MDM3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18519037?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sethmlarson","html_url":"https://github.com/sethmlarson","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sethmlarson/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sethmlarson/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sethmlarson/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sethmlarson/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sethmlarson/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sethmlarson/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sethmlarson/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sethmlarson/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sethmlarson/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-03-23T15:22:30Z","updated_at":"2018-03-23T15:22:30Z","body":"What is the result if you do this?\r\n```python\r\nreturn (\r\n    sa.sql\r\n    .select([sa.sql.func.count(membership.c.user_id)])\r\n    .where(membership.c.group_id == cls.id)\r\n    .group_by(membership.c.group_id)\r\n    .label('members_count')\r\n)\r\n```","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/psf/black/issues/comments/375701069/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"sethmlarson","id":18519037,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NTE5MDM3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18519037?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sethmlarson","html_url":"https://github.com/sethmlarson","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sethmlarson/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sethmlarson/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sethmlarson/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sethmlarson/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sethmlarson/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sethmlarson/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sethmlarson/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sethmlarson/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sethmlarson/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/psf/black/issues/comments/375707411","html_url":"https://github.com/psf/black/issues/67#issuecomment-375707411","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/psf/black/issues/67","id":375707411,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM3NTcwNzQxMQ==","user":{"login":"ambv","id":55281,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1Mjgx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55281?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambv","html_url":"https://github.com/ambv","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambv/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambv/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambv/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambv/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambv/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambv/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambv/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambv/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambv/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-03-23T15:40:36Z","updated_at":"2018-03-23T15:40:36Z","body":"Black doesn't support fluent interfaces or any other hand-formatted idioms.

in py-data, we often use long method chains - aka fluent programming\r\n\r\nThe 'best' approach to grouping items in a chained statement is by method, including any arguments that method takes. By 'best', I mean groups of items which are self-contained - i.e. the items within a group influence other items in their group, but don't influence items outside of their group\r\n\r\nBut at the moment black is splitting methods _from_ their arguments, while grouping methods where possible. Take a case:\r\n\r\n```diff\r\n     result = (\r\n-        data_set\r\n-        .round(0)\r\n-        .isin([0])\r\n-        .sel(dim2=0, dim3='a')\r\n-        .isel(dim1=[0, 1])\r\n-        .drop(['time', 'dim3', 'dim2', 'numbers'])\r\n-        .squeeze()\r\n+        data_set.round(0).isin([0]).sel(dim2=0, dim3='a').isel(\r\n+            dim1=[0, 1]\r\n+        ).drop(\r\n+            ['time', 'dim3', 'dim2', 'numbers']\r\n+        ).squeeze()\r\n     )\r\n```\r\n\r\nHere, `.isel(dim1=[0, 1])` is a self-contained group of information; you can see that and know what's happening. `dim1=[0, 1]` is not - you need to know the method that it's being applied to\r\n\r\nI realize this would probably be a branching in black's logic, since often splitting on args is reasonable. But I'm also fairly confident that black does not handle this specific case well. \r\nIs there a synthesis here that adds this without complication?\r\n\r\nFWIW I've recently starting using Rust, and `rustfmt` does this well.\r\n\r\nOperating system:MacOS\r\nPython version:3.6.4\r\nBlack version:black, version 18.3a4\r\nDoes also happen on master:Y\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/psf/black/issues/93/reactions","total_count":9,"+1":9,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/psf/black/issues/93/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":1550513558,"node_id":"MDEzOlJlb3BlbmVkRXZlbnQxNTUwNTEzNTU4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/psf/black/issues/events/1550513558","actor":{"login":"ambv","id":55281,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1Mjgx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55281?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambv","html_url":"https://github.com/ambv","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambv/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambv/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambv/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambv/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambv/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambv/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambv/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambv/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambv/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"reopened","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-03-30T23:49:01Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/psf/black/issues/comments/377648193","html_url":"https://github.com/psf/black/issues/67#issuecomment-377648193","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/psf/black/issues/67","id":377648193,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM3NzY0ODE5Mw==","user":{"login":"ambv","id":55281,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1Mjgx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55281?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambv","html_url":"https://github.com/ambv","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambv/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambv/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambv/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambv/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambv/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambv/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambv/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambv/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambv/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-03-30T23:53:45Z","updated_at":"2018-03-30T23:53:45Z","body":"I will reconsider this.

that. The reason I do it that way (and afaik prior to learning others did it, I didn't know it had a name!) was because it matches the way I would format the SQL the most and groups the important aspects together on one line (or a few lines), so like taking a look at:\r\n\r\n\r\n```python\r\n        release = (\r\n            request.db.query(Release)\r\n                      # The \"Filter by Release.project\" is one logical \"thought\"\r\n                      .filter(Release.project == project)\r\n                      # The Order by is another logical though, but is too long\r\n                      # for one line, so it has to get split.\r\n                      .order_by(\r\n                          Release.is_prerelease.nullslast(),\r\n                          Release._pypi_ordering.desc())\r\n                      # again, a single logical though, which isn't really modified at all by\r\n                      # the previous lines, they could be deleted/added and this would\r\n                      # stay the same.\r\n                      .limit(1)\r\n                     # and again, one logical thought.\r\n                      .one()\r\n        )\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe black way of formatting that, which is:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nif True:\r\n    if True:\r\n        release = (\r\n            request.db.query(Release).filter(Release.project == project).order_by(\r\n                Release.is_prerelease.nullslast(), Release._pypi_ordering.desc()\r\n            ).limit(\r\n                1\r\n            ).one()\r\n        )\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe individual lines end up doing more than one logical thing, and you end up having to be much more careful about having to read through it to actually understand what's going on, because it each line ends up doing multiple things (the ``.`` are almost acting like ``;`` here, conceptually).\r\n\r\nAnyways, I'm glad you're reconsidering this. The conditions as described sounds like it would work fine for me.","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/psf/black/issues/comments/377650523/reactions","total_count":16,"+1":16,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"dstufft","id":145979,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0NTk3OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/145979?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstufft","html_url":"https://github.com/dstufft","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstufft/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstufft/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstufft/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstufft/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstufft/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstufft/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstufft/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstufft/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstufft/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":1550528765,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MTU1MDUyODc2NQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/psf/black/issues/events/1550528765","actor":{"login":"ambv","id":55281,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1Mjgx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55281?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambv","html_url":"https://github.com/ambv","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambv/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambv/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambv/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambv/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambv/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambv/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambv/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambv/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambv/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-03-31T00:15:21Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":1550528766,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDE1NTA1Mjg3NjY=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/psf/black/issues/events/1550528766","actor":{"login":"ambv","id":55281,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1Mjgx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55281?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambv","html_url":"https://github.com/ambv","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambv/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambv/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambv/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambv/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambv/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambv/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambv/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambv/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambv/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-03-31T00:15:21Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/psf/black/issues/comments/377652139","html_url":"https://github.com/psf/black/issues/67#issuecomment-377652139","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/psf/black/issues/67","id":377652139,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM3NzY1MjEzOQ==","user":{"login":"dstufft","id":145979,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0NTk3OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/145979?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstufft","html_url":"https://github.com/dstufft","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstufft/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstufft/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstufft/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstufft/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstufft/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstufft/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstufft/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstufft/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstufft/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-03-31T00:31:22Z","updated_at":"2018-03-31T00:31:22Z","body":"Oh

Thanks. \r\n\r\n@ambv & @dstufft : Fluent interfaces have been originally discussed by Martin Fowler in 2005 in: https://martinfowler.com/bliki/FluentInterface.html and Eric Evans in the \"Domain Driven Design\" (blue) book.\r\n\r\nThere are some discussions in https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluent_interface , more specifically: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluent_interface#Python though not very deep.\r\n\r\nIn the Python context, I have seen them used mostly for creating DSLs (as stated in the top of the Wikipedia article), more specifically for ORM and ORM-like libraries and frameworks (SQLAlchemy, others).\r\n\r\nMy and @dstufft 's examples give a pretty good idea of what is considered \"canonical\" code when building queries with the SQLAlchemy DSL.\r\n\r\nRegarding the Python standard library, the only cas I can think of strings substitutions. Here's an example where Black reformats Flask's code in a less than savoury way:\r\n\r\n```diff\r\n-    rv = dumps(obj, **kwargs) \\\r\n-        .replace(u'<', u'\\\\u003c') \\\r\n-        .replace(u'>', u'\\\\u003e') \\\r\n-        .replace(u'&', u'\\\\u0026') \\\r\n-        .replace(u\"'\", u'\\\\u0027')\r\n+    rv = dumps(obj, **kwargs).replace(u'<', u'\\\\u003c').replace(\r\n+        u'>', u'\\\\u003e'\r\n+    ).replace(\r\n+        u'&', u'\\\\u0026'\r\n+    ).replace(\r\n+        u\"'\", u'\\\\u0027'\r\n+    )\r\n```\r\n\r\nRegarding how to deal with it: IMHO the best way would be to consider that code with trailing backslashes has already been crafted manually by the programmer, and don't change it. This is, more or less, the current behaviour of Yapf or PyCharm's fomatter.\r\n\r\n@ambv It you still don't agree with this idea, what you propose seems to make sense.\r\n\r\nI note, however, that programmers will have to explicitly add parenthesis about long fluent expressions (as well as non-fluent one, like complex boolean expressions with no function calls) in order for Black to split the lines and not create a pep8 violation.\r\n","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/psf/black/issues/comments/377675264/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"sfermigier","id":271079,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3MTA3OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/271079?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfermigier","html_url":"https://github.com/sfermigier","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfermigier/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfermigier/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfermigier/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfermigier/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfermigier/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfermigier/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfermigier/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfermigier/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sfermigier/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":1550651458,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MTU1MDY1MTQ1OA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/psf/black/issues/events/1550651458","actor":{"login":"ambv","id":55281,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1Mjgx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55281?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambv","html_url":"https://github.com/ambv","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambv/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambv/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambv/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambv/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambv/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambv/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambv/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambv/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambv/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-03-31T08:04:39Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":1550651459,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDE1NTA2NTE0NTk=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/psf/black/issues/events/1550651459","actor":{"login":"ambv","id":55281,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1Mjgx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55281?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambv","html_url":"https://github.com/ambv","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambv/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambv/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambv/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambv/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambv/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambv/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambv/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambv/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambv/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-03-31T08:04:39Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":1550651460,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MTU1MDY1MTQ2MA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/psf/black/issues/events/1550651460","actor":{"login":"dstufft","id":145979,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0NTk3OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/145979?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstufft","html_url":"https://github.com/dstufft","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstufft/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstufft/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstufft/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstufft/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstufft/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstufft/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstufft/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstufft/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dstufft/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-03-31T08:04:39Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":1550651461,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDE1NTA2NTE0NjE=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/psf/black/issues/events/1550651461","actor":{"login":"dstufft","id":145979,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0NTk3OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercon
