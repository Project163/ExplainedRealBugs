the style change**\r\n\r\nCurrently, black does not add a space after unary operators like unpacking, but does around binary operators.  When operator hugging seems to contradict precedence, should black insert parentheses?\r\n\r\n**Examples in the current _Black_ style**\r\nIn all cases, multiplication occurs before unpacking, but it appears that unpacking happens first.\r\n<!-- Think of some short code snippets that show\r\nhow the current _Black_ style is not great: -->\r\n\r\n```python\r\n(*2 * (0,), 0)\r\n(*(0,) * 2, 0)\r\ns = (\r\n    *(0,)\r\n    * a_long_variable_or_expression_that_evaluates_to_2\r\n)\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Desired style**\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n```python\r\n(*(2 * (0,)), 0)\r\n(*((0,) * 2), 0)\r\ns = (\r\n    *(\r\n        (0,)\r\n        * a_long_variable_or_expression_that_evaluates_to_2\r\n    )\r\n)\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\n- Arguments against: Obviously unpacking has to happen last, because unpacking first is a `SyntaxError`.  Also, the additional nesting triggered by `a_long_variable_or...` is unpleasant.\r\n- This example occurred when creating a numpy indexing tuple.  The complete expression has a multiplication operand that is a bit longer, and therefore isn't as easy to visually scan operator precedence:\r\n```python\r\n            s = (*spatial_indicies * (spatial_grid.ndim - 1), slice(None), -1)\r\n```\r\n\r\n- I don't have strong feelings on the matter, but it didn't seem like this behavior was noted in #46, #297, or #305.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/psf/black/issues/3095/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/psf/black/issues/3095/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
