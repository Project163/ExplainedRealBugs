not necessarily advocating that we have to continue on this path, but I'm opening this PR to start the conversation about whether we should do this or not. It is nice to not have to worry about style. From my initial look at this, for the most part it seems to generate better looking code with only a few exceptions (and in those places I've added `# fmt: on/off` directives to disable it). I also modified the travis configuration to enforce usage of the formatter.\r\n\r\nI ran black like so:\r\n\r\n```\r\nblack -S *.py plugins/ xl/ xlgui/ tests/\r\n```\r\n\r\nOne thing it does reformat is our custom of doing imports like so:\r\n\r\n```\r\nfrom xl import (\r\n  common\r\n  nls\r\n)\r\n```\r\n\r\nto \r\n\r\n```\r\nfrom xl import common, nls\r\n```\r\n\r\n... honestly, I don't really care much about that particular style point anyways, so seems fine to me.\r\n\r\nOne thing I do care about is single vs double quoted strings.

Hello! Thanks for submitting a PR. To help make things go a bit more\r\n     smoothly we would appreciate that you go through this template. -->\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nThe goal of this PR is to get files under blib2to3 to be linted during pre-commit. Unfortunately, many of these files have difficult to manage code so to make this PR manageable to review, I've decided to fix some of the flake8 errors while adding `noqa` to others. \r\n\r\nAs an example of why I added `noqa` to some, there are some flake8 linting errors for `src/blib2to3/pgen2/tokenize.py: generate_tokens`, which indicate that a rehaul of this function is really necessary. \r\n\r\n<!-- Good things to put here include: reasoning for the change (please link\r\n     any relevant issues!), any noteworthy (or hacky) choices to be aware of,\r\n     or what the problem resolved here looked like ... we won't mind a ranty\r\n     story :) -->\r\n\r\n### Checklist - did you ...\r\n\r\n<!-- If any of the following items aren't relevant for your contribution\r\n     please still tick them so we know you've gone through the checklist.\r\n\r\n    All user-facing changes should get an entry. Otherwise, signal to us\r\n    this should get the magical label to silence the CHANGELOG entry check.\r\n    Tests are required for bugfixes and new features. Documentation changes\r\n    are necessary for formatting and most enhancement changes. -->\r\n\r\n- [ ] Add an entry in `CHANGES.md` if necessary? **is this necessary for internal change?**\r\n- [x] Add / update tests if necessary?\r\n- [x] Add new / update outdated documentation?\r\n\r\n<!-- Just as a reminder, everyone in all psf/black spaces including PRs\r\n     must follow the PSF Code of Conduct (link below).\r\n\r\n     Finally, once again thanks for your time and effort.
