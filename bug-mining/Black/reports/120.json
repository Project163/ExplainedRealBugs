Black reformats the line, keeping the `# type: ignore` at the end of the statement, but the mypy error is specific to some subexpression that's not on the last line after reformatting.\r\n\r\nFor example,\r\n```py\r\n            new_assocs = ViewNotificationRecipientAssoc.multiadd(assocs_to_add)  # type: ignore\r\n```\r\nis reformatted as\r\n```py\r\n            new_assocs = ViewNotificationRecipientAssoc.multiadd(\r\n                assocs_to_add\r\n            )  # type: ignore\r\n```\r\nbut actually the error happens on the first line, so I must manually change this to\r\n```py\r\n            new_assocs = ViewNotificationRecipientAssoc.multiadd(    # type: ignore\r\n                assocs_to_add\r\n            )\r\n```\r\n(A similar thing happens to list literals and comprehensions.)\r\n\r\nCan you please (even if only as an option) make it so that a `# type: ignore` comment is not considered to exceed the line length?\r\n\r\nNote that for a regular type annotation (e.g. `# type: List[int]`) this is not a problem, so I'm fine with those being moved around. But `# type: ignore` is tied specifically to a line number.\r\n\r\nI wouldn't bring this up if I didn't encounter this over and over.\r\n\r\nCC: @msullivan","closed_by":{"login":"JelleZijlstra","id":906600,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkwNjYwMA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/906600?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra","html_url":"https://github.com/JelleZijlstra","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/psf/black/issues/997/reactions","total_count":11,"+1":10,"-1":1,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/psf/black/issues/997/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
