team overall agreed to use the black code formatter. This PR is an initial migration towards black. The black formatter is only executed on files which are considered stable (i.e., haven't been changed in 30 days) \r\n\r\n**Change**\r\n\r\n- add black configuration\r\n- use black proposed line-length default of 88\r\n- Black formatting on .py files which haven't been changed in the last 30 days according to `git log`\r\n- change test order to lint -> type -> py39\r\n- add dedicated `requirements/` directory to cluster all `requirements-*.txt` files\r\n\r\n**Open Issues**\r\n\r\nThe [first stable release](https://github.com/psf/black/releases/tag/22.1.0) of [black requires `click>=8`](https://github.com/psf/black/issues/2774). We require `click<8.0` in our setup.py. For now, we would be stuck with [previous release](https://github.com/psf/black/releases/tag/21.12b0) until we bump click to >=8. Running `[black 22.1] black --check` did not raise any issues on the formatting of the previous version in this PR. So chances are that a later bump will be unproblematic.\r\n\r\nA follow-up ticket was created to address this. The ticket is linked to the current ticket.\r\n\r\n**Reviewer Notes**\r\n\r\nThis PR makes substantial changes to the code base, i.e., a lot of revert/squash/rebases are necessary to keep up-to-date with master.\r\nTo keep things easy: \r\n1. The first commit in this PR contains all configuration aspects\r\n2. The second commit contains changes from running the formatter.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/app-sre/qontract-reconcile/issues/2190/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":2,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/app-sre/qontract-reconcile/issues/2190/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/psf/black/issues/comments/1050618150","html_url":"https://github.com/psf/black/issues/2774#issuecomment-1050618150","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/psf/black/issues/2774","id":1050618150,"node_id":"IC_kwDOB3dpmM4-nykm","user":{"login":"dashsatish","id":65226700,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1MjI2NzAw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/65226700?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dashsatish","html_url":"https://github.com/dashsatish","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dashsatish/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dashsatish/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dashsatish/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dashsatish/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dashsatish/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dashsatish/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dashsatish/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dashsatish/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dashsatish/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-02-25T07:55:34Z","updated_at":"2022-02-25T07:55:34Z","body":"Hi, Will this be back ported to `22.1.0` or is it gonna be a new release version?
