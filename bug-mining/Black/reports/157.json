Please describe.** \r\n\r\nNot a response to a problem but it might be helpful for the following reasons:\r\n\r\n- Easier to use / less typing\r\n- Can't forget to turn it back on\r\n  - Or accidentally insert code you *do* want formatted into an unformatted block\r\n- Encourages ignoring less code\r\n  - One-offs are always isolated to one statement instead of potentially large chunks of code.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\n\r\n```python\r\nz = \"hello \" + \"world\"\r\n\r\n# fmt: pass\r\ncustom_formatting = [\r\n    0,  1,  2,\r\n    3,  4,  5,\r\n    6,  7,  8,\r\n]\r\n\r\nregular_formatting = [\r\n   0,  1,  2,  'this will be formatted'\r\n]\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe `custom_formatting` list would be ignored, everything else would be formatted.\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\n\r\n1. Current solution\r\n\r\n```python\r\n# fmt: off\r\nugly_code=('but I want it this way')\r\neven_more=('dont\\'t judge me')\r\n# fmt: on\r\n```\r\n2. `#fmt: off` at end of line (#790)\r\n   I believe `# fmt: pass` addresses the same concern while also being a bit more flexible.\r\n    - a single statement could be multi-line\r\n    - a long line would bury an inline comment\r\n    - `# fmt: pass` is more readable & predictable as a separate line\r\n3. Disable formatting for certain expressions only. #798\r\n4. Deal with it\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\n\r\nNaming:\r\n\r\n- `# fmt: pass` reflects Python's existing [pass statement](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html?highlight=pass#the-pass-statement). Hopefully this hints that you can use it to temporarily appease the formatter for one quick thing, but it's not something you want everywhere.\r\n\r\n- Naming could be anything, e.g. \"pass\", \"skip\", \"ignore\"","closed_by":{"login":"JelleZijlstra","id":906600,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkwNjYwMA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/906600?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra","html_url":"https://github.com/JelleZijlstra","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/psf/black/issues/1162/reactions","total_count":25,"+1":25,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/psf/black/issues/1162/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
