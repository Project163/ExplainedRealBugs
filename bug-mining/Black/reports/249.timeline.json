issue for 2023 here: https://github.com/psf/black/issues/3407\r\n\r\nHere's what this issue is:\r\n- I've listed all the features we have enabled under `--preview`\r\n- ...in descending order of how controversial I think they are\r\n- I've also drawn a dividing line; past \"uncontroversial\" is where I feel we don't need to think twice about it\r\n- I've listed the number of digits in the diff-shade lines changed count and linked original PR\r\n- I tried to list any open issues next to the relevant preview feature, but it's possible I missed something\r\n  - <s>Issues tagged with `preview` I haven't yet associated with a feature: #3614 and #3802</s> (sorted these out–Jelle)\r\n\r\nHere's the current call to action:\r\n- Any comments / opinions / vibes on these features is very welcome\r\n- Please test your codebase with `--preview` and let us know your thoughts!\r\n- If you have a specific problem with a preview feature, especially something that feels like an implementation issue, it's best to open a separate issue (that we can then link to from here)\r\n\r\nFor many of the changes, diff-shades logs have expired. We should find a way to keep these around for longer!\r\n\r\nIt's currently November, so there's still time to make more uncontroversial changes and hopefuly iron out some issues in the not uncontroversial ones.\r\n\r\n## Not uncontroversial\r\n\r\n#### string_processing\r\n\r\nThis one is controversial, vast majority of preview style issues are related to string processing\r\nOpen issues I believe are caused by string_processing: #2334, #2314, #3466, #3497, #3409, #3424, #3428, #3210, #3410, #3747, #3665, #3663, #2553, #3855, #3802\r\n\r\n#### hug_parens_with_braces_and_square_brackets (#3964, #3992)\r\n\r\nCauses O(10000) changes, although counting lines changed is unfavourable to this change.\r\nA very substantial change in style for Black. We can't revert once it's in stable.\r\nOutstanding crash: #4036\r\n\r\n#### parenthesize_conditional_expressions (#2278)\r\n\r\nCauses O(1000) changes. Need to look at diff\r\n~Has unfortunate interactions with comments: #3555~\r\n\r\n#### wrap_long_dict_values_in_parens (#3440)\r\n\r\nCauses O(100) changes. Need to look at diff\r\n~Outstanding crash: #3758~\r\nReport of worse splitting: #3452\r\n~Unnecessary nesting: #4129~\r\nRemoves parentheses: #4158\r\n\r\n#### multiline_string_handling (#1879)\r\n\r\nCauses O(1000) changes. Need to look at diff\r\nMaybe has some synergy with `hug_parens_with_braces_and_square_brackets`.\r\nUnfortunate white space preservation: #4159\r\n\r\n#### dummy_implementations (#3796)\r\n\r\nI can't find up-to-date diff-shades, but maybe O(1000) changes\r\nRequires a change in flake8 config: #3887\r\nCan result in an extra line, but no change expected to be made: #3872\r\n\r\n#### prefer_splitting_right_hand_side_of_assignments (#3368)\r\n\r\nCauses O(100) changes.\r\n\r\n#### hex_codes_in_unicode_sequences (#2916)\r\n\r\nCauses O(100) changes\r\nOpen issue whether lowercase or uppercase is better #3568\r\n\r\n#### allow_empty_first_line_before_new_block_or_comment (#3967)\r\n\r\nCauses O(1) changes.\r\nThis change itself is fine, but it's related to a controversial and churn causing change in 2023 style. I think we should probably revert that 2023 change; I posted a longer issue about this over here https://github.com/psf/black/issues/4043\r\n\r\n#### parenthesize_long_type_hints (#3899)\r\n\r\nCauses O(100) changes\r\n\r\n#### module_docstring_newlines (#3932)\r\n\r\nCauses O(100) changes\r\n\r\n## Uncontroversial\r\n\r\n#### respect_magic_trailing_comma_in_return_type (#3916)\r\n\r\nO(10) changes.\r\nShouldn't affect existing formatting too much, unless there's a buggy trailing comma\r\nAll changes in diff-shades are incidental, but are good and what you'd expect Black to do\r\n\r\n#### no_blank_line_before_class_docstring (#3692)\r\n\r\nO(100) changes. Makes consistent with function behaviour\r\nBlank lines have been a little controversial, but I think this should be totally fine\r\n\r\n#### wrap_multiple_context_managers_in_parens (#3489)\r\n\r\nO(100) changes. Naively, looks great to me\r\n\r\n#### fix_power_op_line_length (#3942)\r\n\r\nO(10) changes. A bug fix\r\n\r\n#### add_trailing_comma_consistently (#3393)\r\n\r\nO(1) changes. A bug fix\r\n\r\n#### skip_magic_trailing_comma_in_subscript (#3209)\r\n\r\nO(1) changes. A bug fix, affects a non-default option\r\n\r\n#### blank_line_after_nested_stub_class (#3564)\r\n\r\nOnly affects stubs, adds some blank lines in an uncommon case\r\n\r\n#### blank_line_between_nested_and_def_stub_file (#3862)\r\n\r\nOnly affects stubs, adds some blank lines in even less common case\r\n\r\n#### accept_raw_docstrings (#3947)\r\n\r\nO(1) changes. Just a bug fix\r\n\r\n#### long_case_block_line_splitting (#4024)\r\n\r\n0 changes. Seems strictly good\r\n\r\n#### walrus_subscript (#3823)\r\n\r\n0 changes. Straightforward style change\r\n\r\n#### improved_async_statements_handling  (#3609)\r\n\r\n0 changes. More consistent\r\n\r\n#### single_line_format_skip_with_multiple_comments (#3959)\r\n\r\n0 changes.

this input:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nx = {\r\n    \"xx_xxxxx_xxxxxxxxxx_xxxxxxxxx_xx\": (\r\n        \"xx:xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx_xxxxx_xxxxxxx_xxxxxxxxxxx{xx}xxx_xxxxx_xxxxxxxxx_xxxxxxxxxxxx_xxxx\"\r\n

\"xx:xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx_xxxxx_xxxxxxx_xxxxxxxxxxx{xx}xxx_xxxxx_xxxxxxxxx_xxxxxxxxxxxx_xxxx\",\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is because the string is long enough that it doesn't fit within the line length even if it's wrapped in parentheses.\r\n\r\nHowever, the new style feels worse: it's over the line length either way, but it's a lot *more* over the line length in the new formatting.\r\n\r\nThe new style is consistent with our formatting in a few other cases, however. For example, we also remove the parentheses in:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nxx_xxxxx_xxxxxxxxxx_xxxxxxxxx_xx = (\r\n    xx_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx_xxxxx_xxxxxxx_xxxxxxxxxxx_xx_xxx_xxxxx_xxxxxxxxx_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx\r\n)\r\n```\r\n\r\nIs this bad enough to justify removing `wrap_long_dict_values_in_parens` from the new stable style? I'm not sure.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/psf/black/issues/4158/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/psf/black/issues/4158/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":11543917349,"node_id":"CE_lADOB3dpmM56qyQ-zwAAAAKwEjMl","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/psf/black/issues/events/11543917349","actor":{"login":"JelleZijlstra","id":906600,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkwNjYwMA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/906600?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra","html_url":"https://github.com/JelleZijlstra","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2024-01-20T01:13:28Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":11543917388,"node_id":"REFE_lADOB3dpmM56qyQ-zwAAAAKwEjNM","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/psf/black/issues/events/11543917388","actor":{"login":"JelleZijlstra","id":906600,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkwNjYwMA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/906600?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra","html_url":"https://github.com/JelleZijlstra","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"995e4ada14d63a9bec39c5fc83275d0e49742618","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/psf/black/commits/995e4ada14d63a9bec39c5fc83275d0e49742618","created_at":"2024-01-20T01:13:28Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
