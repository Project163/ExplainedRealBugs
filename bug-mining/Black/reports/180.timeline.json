for the report, but that is not how docker hub works by default and how most projects seem to use default latest tagging with their docker images too. We don’t control the `latest` tag, it gets auto moved with every upload. Most other docker projects (from what I seen) use latest for every version that gets upload too. I’d prefer we stay the norm for docker (happy to be proven wrong here).\r\n\r\nSo our tagging today is:\r\n- Version only\r\n- Everything else gets latest_non_release\r\n- Everything gets latest at time of upload\r\n\r\nI guess we could introduce a tag (maybe `latest_release`) to achieve what you want here. If we could update the action to move this tag on a release I’d happily accept that. I might get to trying to add this one day, but I don’t know how to achieve this off the top of my head in the action `.yaml` config …","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/psf/black/issues/comments/880988394/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"cooperlees","id":3005596,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwMDU1OTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3005596?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cooperlees","html_url":"https://github.com/cooperlees","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cooperlees/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cooperlees/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cooperlees/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cooperlees/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cooperlees/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cooperlees/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cooperlees/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cooperlees/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cooperlees/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/psf/black/issues/comments/881030349","html_url":"https://github.com/psf/black/issues/2373#issuecomment-881030349","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/psf/black/issues/2373","id":881030349,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDg4MTAzMDM0OQ==","user":{"login":"pszlazak","id":11884243,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExODg0MjQz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11884243?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pszlazak","html_url":"https://github.com/pszlazak","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pszlazak/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pszlazak/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pszlazak/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pszlazak/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pszlazak/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pszlazak/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pszlazak/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pszlazak/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pszlazak/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-07-15T21:39:35Z","updated_at":"2021-07-15T21:39:35Z","body":"Just confirmed using open source [Docker Registry](https://docs.docker.com/registry/):\r\n- if you push without tag, `latest` tag will be added automatically\r\n- but if you push with any tag, no `latest` is created\r\n\r\nSo I can be in the situation where I have:\r\n- image with tag `v1` and `latest`\r\n- image with tag `v2` (of course with some changes)\r\n\r\nThen I can retag them, so `latest` is used for `v2`.\r\n\r\nI guess the problem is with following line of [`docker.yml`](https://github.com/psf/black/blob/main/.github/workflows/docker.yml):\r\n```\r\ntags: pyfound/black:latest,pyfound/black:${{ env.GIT_TAG }}\r\n      ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\r\n```\r\nMaybe you should have two separate steps:\r\n```\r\n      -
