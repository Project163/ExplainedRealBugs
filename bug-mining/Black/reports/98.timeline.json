system: MacOS\r\nPython version: 3.7.0\r\n*Black* version: 18.6b4\r\nDoes also happen on master: yes\r\n\r\nI can't quite tell if this is intended behavior or if it is emergent behavior caused by other things.\r\n\r\nI noticed this because `black` and `isort` (configured with `multi_line_output = 3` and `include_trailing_comma = True`) started fighting over a particular line.\r\n\r\nPer the trailing comma rules, it it my understanding that all multi-member expressions defined over multiple lines should have a trailing comma at the end of each member line, but expressions that fit on a single line and do not syntactically require a trailing comma will have that trailing comma removed.\r\n\r\nThis is good, and in my experience this is what `black` does. However, there is an edge case that is not directly addressed in the rules in the readme: an expression that can contain multiple members but only contains a single member and cannot fit on a single line.\r\n\r\nBased on my understanding of the reason behind the adding trailing commas to the end of multi-line expression members (making diffs less bad), I would think that the single member in these cases should still have a trailing comma.\r\n\r\nHowever, based on the \"remove trailing commas on single line expressions unless syntactically necessary\" exception, the trailing comma should not be present.\r\n\r\nThe behavior that `black` applies follows the rules that would be followed if the expressions were contained on a single line. Is this intentional? If so, could a mention of this exception be added to the readme?\r\n\r\ninput:\r\n```python\r\nfrom long_namespace_that_makes_the_line_too_line import (\r\n
