Note that if you pass `--config` to that same command it works. \r\n\r\n**Environment (please complete the following information):**\r\n\r\n- Version: 20.8b1\r\n- OS and Python version: macOS 10.15.7, Python 3.7.2 (but target version is 3.6)\r\n\r\n**Does this bug also happen on master?** To answer this, you have two options:\r\n\r\nYes with:\r\n\r\n> 2. Or run _Black_ on your machine:\r\n>    - create a new virtualenv (make sure it's the same Python version);\r\n>    - clone this repository;\r\n>    - run `pip install -e .`;\r\n>    - make sure it's sane by running `python -m unittest`; and\r\n>    - run `black` like you did last time.\r\n> \r\n\r\n**Additional context** Add any other context about the problem here.\r\n\r\nWe haven't normalized our strings yet because it's a ~30k line change (we plan to in the coming months). Noting that it seems to be a general \"not respecting pyproject.toml\" issue but string normalization was the most obvious thing.","closed_by":{"login":"JelleZijlstra","id":906600,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkwNjYwMA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/906600?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra","html_url":"https://github.com/JelleZijlstra","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/psf/black/issues/1880/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/psf/black/issues/1880/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
