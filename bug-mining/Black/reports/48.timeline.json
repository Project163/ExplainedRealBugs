Description\r\n\r\nThis add `isort` in the pre-commit configuration file and also apply it on all applicable files. Isort permit to sort import so there is less conflict during merging and rebase of file with conflicting modification. We're using a style of import compatible with `black` and made some efforts so that automated changes made by `black` are not deemed invalid and automatically reverted by `isort` later in the commit hooks : \r\n* The ignored file are the same\r\n* The line length is the same\r\n* The style of import is compatible (For more detail see https://github.com/ambv/black/issues/127)\r\n* **For comment inside import, there is a minor issue that would require a change in Black : https://github.com/ambv/black/issues/251**\r\n\r\nIt also update the version of `Black`, and of pre-commit's
