having a simple rule is elegant, I think matching spoken word is important like James pointed out. Just to provide one more perspective, I'd prefer:\r\n\r\n- `rf` - raw f-string\r\n- `rb` - raw byte string\r\n\r\nThe simple rule in this case would be \"have `r` first\", if simplicity is important.","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/psf/black/issues/comments/830645585/reactions","total_count":11,"+1":11,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"felix-hilden","id":25202257,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1MjAyMjU3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25202257?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/felix-hilden","html_url":"https://github.com/felix-hilden","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/felix-hilden/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/felix-hilden/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/felix-hilden/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/felix-hilden/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/felix-hilden/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/felix-hilden/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/felix-hilden/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/felix-hilden/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/felix-hilden/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":4686025164,"node_id":"MDE0OlVubGFiZWxlZEV2ZW50NDY4NjAyNTE2NA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/psf/black/issues/events/4686025164","actor":{"login":"ichard26","id":63936253,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzOTM2MjUz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/63936253?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ichard26","html_url":"https://github.com/ichard26","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ichard26/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ichard26/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ichard26/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ichard26/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ichard26/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ichard26/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ichard26/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ichard26/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ichard26/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"unlabeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-05-04T22:42:17Z","label":{"name":"T:
