My Python code is littered with alternating ' and \" strings, sometimes even in the same dictionary, like so:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n{\r\n    'My key': \"has a value\",\r\n    \"my quote\": 'is doubled',\r\n}\r\n```\r\nI don't have an opinion on which is best (and I don't want to), but I wish to hell my code was consistent. There are good reasons to use one or the other (if the string contains other quotes, for example), but in general, I wish they were all the same. Maybe it could adjust any string that is enclosed in `'` characters and does not contain a `\"` character to be wrapped with `\"` characters (or vice versa):\r\n\r\ne.g\r\n`'hello' becomes \"hello\"`\r\n`'She said \"yes\"'` doesn't change\r\n`\"Don't do that\"` never changes.\r\n\r\nShould also be able to change all triple quotes to the same character as well unless the string contains the inverse quote.","closed_by":{"login":"ambv","id":55281,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1Mjgx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55281?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambv","html_url":"https://github.com/ambv","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambv/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambv/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambv/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambv/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambv/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambv/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambv/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambv/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambv/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/psf/black/issues/51/reactions","total_count":14,"+1":14,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/psf/black/issues/51/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
