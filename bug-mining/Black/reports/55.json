I start to use black for a project with math formula and I think black sometimes makes the code less readable.\r\n\r\nTwo simple examples:\r\n\r\n### Equations not fitting on one line\r\n\r\n```\r\nif True:\r\n    if True:\r\n        PK1_fft = np.real(\r\n            + vx_fft.conj() * fx_fft\r\n            + vy_fft.conj() * fy_fft\r\n            + vz_fft.conj() * fz_fft\r\n        )\r\n```\r\n\r\nis transformed by `black -l 82` into\r\n\r\n```\r\nif True:\r\n    if True:\r\n        PK1_fft = np.real(\r\n            +vx_fft.conj()\r\n            * fx_fft\r\n            + vy_fft.conj()\r\n            * fy_fft\r\n            + vz_fft.conj()\r\n            * fz_fft\r\n        )\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe result is clearly less readable. It would be nice that black keeps the code as it is in such cases.\r\n\r\n### Spaces around pow operator\r\n\r\n```\r\nresult = 2 * x**2 + 3 * x**(2/3)\r\n```\r\nis transformed by `black` into\r\n```\r\nresult = 2 * x ** 2 + 3 * x ** (2 / 3)\r\n```\r\nwhich is less readable.\r\n\r\nIt seems to me it would make sense to allow \"no space around `**`\" because of the high precedence of the exponentiation (https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#operator-precedence).\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"ambv","id":55281,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1Mjgx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55281?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambv","html_url":"https://github.com/ambv","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambv/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambv/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambv/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambv/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambv/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambv/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambv/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambv/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambv/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/psf/black/issues/148/reactions","total_count":4,"+1":4,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/psf/black/issues/148/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
