I have couple of implementation detail questions about this:\r\n- This regex should be applied on the entire path when considering whether to include/exclude something, correct? Not just the name (as is currently done with the includes). So one could pass `test\\/secrets` to `--exclude` and it would drop `files/test/secrets/*` but not `files/test/notsecrets/`?\r\n- I'm wondering how to handle directories in the regexes. Initially, I though something like `build\\/` would be fine, but pathlib strips trailing slashes from the path. I'd prefer to do it this way, since `\\/build` doesn't always work (if its a directory at the root of wherever black is searching from, the path will just be (`'build'`) - do you think it be sensible to just append a `'/'` to the path when applying the regex if the child is a directory?","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/psf/black/issues/comments/393305731/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"autophagy","id":12958979,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyOTU4OTc5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12958979?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/autophagy","html_url":"https://github.com/autophagy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/autophagy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/autophagy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/autophagy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/autophagy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/autophagy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/autophagy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/autophagy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/autophagy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/autophagy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":1654512613,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MTY1NDUxMjYxMw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/psf/black/issues/events/1654512613","actor":{"login":"ambv","id":55281,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1Mjgx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55281?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambv","html_url":"https://github.com/ambv","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambv/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambv/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambv/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambv/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambv/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambv/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambv/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambv/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambv/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-05-30T20:23:28Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":1654512614,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDE2NTQ1MTI2MTQ=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/psf/black/issues/events/1654512614","actor":{"login":"ambv","id":55281,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1Mjgx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55281?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambv","html_url":"https://github.com/ambv","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambv/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambv/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambv/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambv/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambv/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambv/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambv/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambv/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambv/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-05-30T20:23:28Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/psf/black/issues/comments/393314298","html_url":"https://github.com/psf/black/issues/270#issuecomment-393314298","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/psf/black/issues/270","id":393314298,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM5MzMxNDI5OA==","user":{"login":"ambv","id":55281,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1Mjgx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55281?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambv","html_url":"https://github.com/ambv","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambv/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambv/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambv/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambv/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambv/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambv/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambv/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambv/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambv/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-05-30T20:48:58Z","updated_at":"2018-05-30T20:48:58Z","body":"Re
