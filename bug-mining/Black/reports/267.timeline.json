you for taking the time to report an issue! We're glad to have you involved with Ruff.\r\n\r\nIf you're filing a bug report, please consider including the following information:\r\n\r\n* List of keywords you searched for before creating this issue. Write them down here so that others can find this issue more easily and help provide feedback.\r\n  e.g. \"RUF001\", \"unused variable\", \"Jupyter notebook\"\r\n* A minimal code snippet that reproduces the bug.\r\n* The command you invoked (e.g., `ruff /path/to/file.py --fix`), ideally including the `--isolated` flag.\r\n* The current Ruff settings (any relevant sections from your `pyproject.toml`).\r\n* The current Ruff version (`ruff --version`).\r\n-->\r\n\r\n**Keywords**\r\nLine length, comprehension\r\n\r\n\r\n**Example**\r\n*Before `ruff --fix`*\r\n```\r\nreally_really_really_long_dict_name = {\"foo\": \"bar\"}\r\n\r\ndict_with_really_long_names = {really_really_really_long_key_name: really_really_really_long_key_value for really_really_really_long_key_name, really_really_really_long_key_value in really_really_really_long_dict_name.items()}\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n*After `ruff --fix`* (Both the \"before ruff fix\" and \"manual attempt below\" lead to this)\r\n\r\n```\r\ndict_with_really_long_names = {\r\n    really_really_really_long_key_name: really_really_really_long_key_value\r\n    for really_really_really_long_key_name, really_really_really_long_key_value in really_really_really_long_dict_name.items()\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n*Expected (or Proposed) after `ruff --fix`* (running ruff on this also leads back to the after case)\r\n```\r\ndict_with_really_long_names = {\r\n    really_really_really_long_key_name: really_really_really_long_key_value\r\n    for really_really_really_long_key_name, really_really_really_long_key_value \r\n    in really_really_really_long_dict_name.items()\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nThat `for/in` line is 127 characters long, but it could come under the line length (default of 88, not set here) by splitting the `for/in` statements, which does not affect behavior in this case.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Version/Command**\r\nUsing ruff v0.5.1 with pre-commit calling `ruff --fix`.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Comparison with `black`**\r\nCurrently, this runs with the same behavior as `black`.\r\nAnother user brought up a similar suggestion here:
