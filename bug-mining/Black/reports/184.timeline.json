This is the *available CPUs* but that requires that you set the cgroup on your container, which isn't yet supported by many container managers. I know our version of K8s doesn't yet.\r\n* Another would be simply setting the maximum to be some reasonable number. This is what we do in `win32` [here](https://github.com/psf/black/blob/39b55f787cff41ef9726b256cfdbedefe6d5c716/src/black/__init__.py#L653-L655). Do people *really* need to run on more that 32 (or even 16 or 8!) threads?\r\n* Figuring out if we are in containers is not as simple as it sounds. There [are ways](https://github.com/sindresorhus/is-docker/blob/main/index.js) for docker/k8s but this wouldn't be generic. Other container types would be ignored. A generic solution for how many CPUs a container is limited to is more or less impossible.\r\n\r\nI'll submit my PR but happy for it to be rejected if a better solution is found. I'd rather get this solved sooner than later though, a lot of projects are currently blackless where I work :(\r\n\r\nI understand why `black` attempts to reduce the number of CLI switches, and I support it, but I think this is a genuine use case, changing how the program runs rather than what it does.","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/psf/black/issues/comments/928172694/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":1},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"FHTMitchell","id":24977101,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0OTc3MTAx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24977101?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/FHTMitchell","html_url":"https://github.com/FHTMitchell","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FHTMitchell/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FHTMitchell/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FHTMitchell/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FHTMitchell/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FHTMitchell/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FHTMitchell/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FHTMitchell/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FHTMitchell/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FHTMitchell/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":5367616929,"node_id":"MEE_lADOB3dpmM48G5onzwAAAAE_71Wh","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/psf/black/issues/events/5367616929","actor":{"login":"cooperlees","id":3005596,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwMDU1OTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3005596?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cooperlees","html_url":"https://github.com/cooperlees","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cooperlees/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cooperlees/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cooperlees/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cooperlees/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cooperlees/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cooperlees/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cooperlees/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cooperlees/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cooperlees/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-09-27T18:44:52Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":5367616948,"node_id":"SE_lADOB3dpmM48G5onzwAAAAE_71W0","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/psf/black/issues/events/5367616948","actor":{"login":"cooperlees","id":3005596,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwMDU1OTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3005596?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cooperlees","html_url":"https://github.com/cooperlees","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cooperlees/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cooperlees/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cooperlees/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cooperlees/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cooperlees/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cooperlees/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cooperlees/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cooperlees/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cooperlees/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-09-27T18:44:52Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/psf/black/issues/comments/928187338","html_url":"https://github.com/psf/black/issues/2513#issuecomment-928187338","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/psf/black/issues/2513","id":928187338,"node_id":"IC_kwDOB3dpmM43UwPK","user":{"login":"felix-hilden","id":25202257,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1MjAyMjU3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25202257?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/felix-hilden","html_url":"https://github.com/felix-hilden","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/felix-hilden/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/felix-hilden/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/felix-hilden/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/felix-hilden/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/felix-hilden/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/felix-hilden/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/felix-hilden/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/felix-hilden/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/felix-hilden/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-09-27T19:06:17Z","upd

your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**\r\n\r\nI ran into https://github.com/psf/black/issues/2513 in my CI system\r\n\r\nWhile I can hardcode `--workers` into my invocations of black (in this case, via pre-commit), it's a little unnatural, since the number of cores differs between CI workers and say locally. E.g., I can hardcode the minimum of them, but then we leave some perf on the table.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\n\r\nI'd like to specify it by environment variable, say `BLACK_NUM_WORKERS`. This isn't unprecedented, e.g. `BLACK_CACHE_DIR` exists. This does increase configuration complexity a little.\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\n\r\nJust hardcoding `--workers`. It's not the biggest deal.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/psf/black/issues/3742/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/psf/black/issues/3742/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
