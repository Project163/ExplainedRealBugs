system: macOS\r\nPython version: 3.6.1\r\nBlack version: 18.4a2\r\nDoes also happen on master:  Yes\r\n\r\nAfter running black, I've gotten code formatted like:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nclass Classifier(db.ModelBase):\r\n\r\n    __tablename__ = \"trove_classifiers\"\r\n    __table_args__ = (\r\n        Index(\"trove_class_class_idx\", \"classifier\"), Index(\"trove_class_id_idx\", \"id\")\r\n    )\r\n\r\n    __repr__ = make_repr(\"classifier\")\r\n\r\n    id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True, nullable=False)\r\n    classifier = Column(Text, unique=True)\r\n    deprecated = Column(Boolean, nullable=False, server_default=sql.false())\r\n    l2 = Column(Integer)\r\n    l3 = Column(Integer)\r\n    l4 = Column(Integer)\r\n    l5 = Column(Integer)\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhile I understand the intention is for a sequence that can fit on one line to be on one line, this list here obviously *can't* fit on one line (it's been broken over 3 lines!) but it can only fit onto one line when you remove part of the syntax that makes it a list/tuple/whatever.\r\n\r\nI think that it would be easier to read if the detection of a multi-line sequence was more aggressive, either it should *all* fit onto one line, or it should be formatted like:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nclass Classifier(db.ModelBase):\r\n\r\n    __tablename__ = \"trove_classifiers\"\r\n    __table_args__ = (\r\n        Index(\"trove_class_class_idx\", \"classifier\"),\r\n        Index(\"trove_class_id_idx\", \"id\"),\r\n    )\r\n\r\n    __repr__ = make_repr(\"classifier\")\r\n\r\n    id = Column(Integer,
