Please describe.**\r\n\r\nCurrently, `black` ignores the filename passed to `--stdin-filename` to determine if it is a python file or stub file for formatting. This is frustrating for me because I have to set up a separate file type for python stub files to use `coc.nvim` + `coc-diagnostic` in order to use a different command line invocation (adding `--pyi`) to process stub files.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\n\r\nWhen `black` is invoked with `--stdin-filename`, it should set the `is_pyi` flag on the `Mode` like what is done at the beginning of `format_file_in_place()`.","closed_by":{"login":"ambv","id":55281,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1Mjgx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55281?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambv","html_url":"https://github.com/ambv","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambv/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambv/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambv/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambv/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambv/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambv/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambv/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambv/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambv/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/psf/black/issues/2167/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/psf/black/issues/2167/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
