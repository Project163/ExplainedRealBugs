had the same issue, and now solved. The steps were the suspected ones:\r\n\r\n1. Install python 3.6 through `brew`: `brew update && brew install python3`\r\n1. `sudo pip3 install black`\r\n1. Check `black` command works with `No paths given. Nothing to do 😴`\r\n1. Create external tool in PyCharm (see below)\r\n\r\nAs an external tool it works:\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1827475/40989748-cb3badb4-68bc-11e8-91ca-d33fbb434183.png)\r\n\r\nWith `pycharm-black` extension it happens as described here: [https://github.com/pablogsal/black-pycharm/issues/2](pablogsal/black-pycharm/issues/2), it picks Java's Runtime to perform it what it seems to not work well in MacOS: https://github.com/pablogsal/black-pycharm/blob/master/src/ReformatCode.java#L53 (God's know why, even if you have generally set LANG and LC's well configured). The only workaround to make the extension work is to modify `/usr/local/bin/black` and set locales in Python by hand 😅 I did it and then uninstalled the extension then put the original black code back 😎.","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/psf/black/issues/comments/394779564/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"danigosa","id":1827475,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4Mjc0NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1827475?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/danigosa","html_url":"https://github.com/danigosa","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danigosa/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danigosa/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danigosa/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danigosa/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danigosa/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danigosa/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danigosa/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danigosa/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danigosa/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/psf/black/issues/comments/394810428","html_url":"https://github.com/psf/black/issues/277#issuecomment-394810428","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/psf/black/issues/277","id":394810428,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM5NDgxMDQyOA==","user":{"login":"vlasovskikh","id":126891,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNjg5MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/126891?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vlasovskikh","html_url":"https://github.com/vlasovskikh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vlasovskikh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vlasovskikh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vlasovskikh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vlasovskikh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vlasovskikh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vlasovskikh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vlasovskikh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vlasovskikh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vlasovskikh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-06-05T18:20:06Z","updated_at":"2018-06-05T18:20:06Z","body":"@danigosa
