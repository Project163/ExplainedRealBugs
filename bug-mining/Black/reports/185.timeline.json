Black is stable once Django adopts it\n\n😀\n\nJust to comment on that, it was a point at the time Django agreed to adopt Black that we would wait for the _stable_ release. That we haven't adopted it is because no such release has come. \n\nSo from our perspective it would be good to reach that point. \n\nIt's been a couple of years now, so I suspect resistance to adopting Black (at all) has probably shrunk considerably, but from the outside it's not easy to see what's left to do for a _stable_ version. \n\nI think it has to be acceptable to leave open the possibility of future changes, so _stable_ can't just mean _frozen_. \n\nIf there were a clear statement, it might allow us to decide to adopt Black anyway, even though a _stable_ version wasn't yet released. \n\nOf course that conversation might not go well, but at the moment it's hard to even find grounds to open it. \n\nI hope that's of some use. \n\nThanks for the great efforts, and the great project!

This is a significantly more dilute promise than \"it will never change, except bugs\" but that also means you can make improvements and don't have to argue about \"is that a bug\" with users. I think y'all are very aware that changes in black's behaviours are very disruptive, so I'm willing to trust that you won't make horrible choices just because you have this option.\r\n\r\nWith such a policy, it would also make sense to have a `--i-want-next-year-stuff-now` flag (with a better name please) to facilitate early adoption -- which will help weed out bugs as well as be a nice mechanism for users to try out the upcoming changes.\r\n\r\nOf course, this ties improvements to the calendar year, but honestly, I kinda like that. Plus, with Python itself moving to an annual cadence and black becoming more and more stable, I feel like that's fine. Plus, I can't think of any other approach to use version numbers to communicate compatibility; unless you're open to changing the versioning scheme.

Sure.

(That's not your issue of course, but I'm hoping a resolution here will allow us to push forwards.) \n\nI'll leave it now. I wanted to add a big 👍 with some context, rather than distract.

I started wondering, given our choice of calendar versioning, what would be the best way of communicating the degree of disruption. Semantic versions (or if not strictly semantic, simply ordinary version numbers) are more obvious in that regard, but we won't have such luxury. Would it suffice to describe the changes in release notes and expect users to thoroughly review them? I mean, that's a perfectly valid option! And maybe the only good one. A short summary of changes or their scope might also help users.","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/psf/black/issues/comments/887047360/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"felix-hilden","id":25202257,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1MjAyMjU3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25202257?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/felix-hilden","html_url":"https://github.com/felix-hilden","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/felix-hilden/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/felix-hilden/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/felix-hilden/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/felix-hilden/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/felix-hilden/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/felix-hilden/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/felix-hilden/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/felix-hilden/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/felix-hilden/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/psf/black/issues/comments/887051034","html_url":"https://github.com/psf/black/issues/2394#issuecomment-887051034","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/psf/black/issues/2394","id":887051034,"node_id":"IC_kwDOB3dpmM4031Ma","user":{"login":"JelleZijlstra","id":906600,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkwNjYwMA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/906600?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra","html_url":"https://github.com/JelleZijlstra","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-07-26T21:50:21Z","updated_at":"2021-07-26T21:50:21Z","body":"I'm warming up to @pradyunsg's idea above, which I'd detail as follows: We provide a stability guarantee for one year, plus an `--unstable` option that provides new formatting changes that we like. At the beginning of each new year, we provide a release that turns the unstable behavior into the default. `--unstable` will then do nothing until we come up with something else we want to change. We guarantee that (as long as you don't use `--unstable`), Black will format any valid Python code the same way for all releases in the same year, so you can safely upgrade (and get any stability

be quite good in my opinion too! And having the option, rather than some separate unstable releases, should also be smoother for development. Concretely then, I imagine our release notes would have an \"Unstable\" section, and new year's releases could pull them all to one big changelog. This all seems very reasonable, since it won't hinder development behind the unstable flag at all! Hooray for SemCalVer 😄\r\n\r\n> When does Black accept formatting changes? How is the decision to change formatting made?\r\n\r\nI think it *should* be whenever the new style is decidedly better, by whatever metric we choose. Otherwise we would be cornering ourselves once more. \"How?\", is the harder question. I think the current approach of communication, consensus and Łukasz' veto have been working well.\r\n\r\n> What are the guarantees Black wants to continue making? When will we make exceptions to the AST safety guarantee?\r\n\r\nIn my opinion the current exceptions are fine. Some programs might rely on strict docstring formatting and such, but the gain does outweigh the potential problems. *However*, as @pradyunsg suggested on Discord with changing the indent of `textwrap.dedent` with multiline strings, more of these AST-unsafe-but-probably-safe-overall transforms exist. If we were to start implementing them, I'd really like to see a flag disabling all AST-unsafe transformations (some [discussion](https://github.com/psf/black/issues/2150#issuecomment-827929164)) or enabling them, either way. *But*, I also feel like it could be a slippery slope, although I know additional transformations like import reordering are a highly-requested feature (#333). Personally I like clear separation of concerns, because there are tools like Tox and pre-commit that can be used to combine functionality across many tools.\r\n\r\n> How will this change when we have a \"stable\" release? Will anything change?\r\n\r\nWith all of this in mind, I don't see a clear reason to keep Black in beta. So there could be two options of performing our first non-beta release. Right away: let's communicate it's nothing special and document our stability and version support policies, OR next january, when we would have more time to set things up and prepare users.\r\n\r\nIt would be really nice to hear what @ambv thinks of all this!","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/psf/black/issues/comments/887255369/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"felix-hilden","id":25202257,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1MjAyMjU3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25202257?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/felix-hilden","html_url":"https://github.com/felix-hilden","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/felix-hilden/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/felix-hilden/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/felix-hilden/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/felix-hilden/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/felix-hilden/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/felix-hilden/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/felix-hilden/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/felix-hilden/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/felix-hilden/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}}]
