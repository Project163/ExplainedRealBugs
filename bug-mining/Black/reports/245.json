In the second run, `black` should reformat `print ()` to `print()`, but this does not happen:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ ./bug.sh \r\n+ echo 'print (1)'\r\n+ black file.py\r\nreformatted file.py\r\n\r\nAll done! ✨ 🍰 ✨\r\n1 file reformatted.\r\n+ echo 'print ()'\r\n+ black file.py\r\nAll done! ✨ 🍰 ✨\r\n1 file left unchanged.\r\n+ cat file.py\r\nprint ()\r\n```\r\n\r\nEven running it manually after a few seconds does not fix the issue, but removing the cache directory does:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ black file.py\r\nAll done! ✨ 🍰 ✨\r\n1 file left unchanged.\r\n$ cat file.py\r\nprint ()\r\n$ rm -r ~/Library/Caches/black/\r\n$ black file.py\r\nreformatted file.py\r\n\r\nAll done! ✨ 🍰 ✨\r\n1 file reformatted.\r\n$ cat file.py\r\nprint()\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\n\r\nI think black should not get confused by changes to files that happen quickly after it has formatted a file. The file should be checked again if it is possible that its content has changed without also changing its timestamp.\r\n\r\n**Environment**\r\n\r\n- Black's version:\r\n\r\n    ```\r\n    $ black --version\r\n    black, 23.12.0 (compiled: yes)\r\n    Python (CPython) 3.11.6\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n- OS and Python version: macOS 12.7.1, Python 3.11.6 installed via Homebrew.","closed_by":{"login":"hauntsaninja","id":12621235,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNjIxMjM1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12621235?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja","html_url":"https://github.com/hauntsaninja","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/psf/black/issues/4116/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/psf/black/issues/4116/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
