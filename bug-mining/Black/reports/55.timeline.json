always found what other formatters are doing here wrong and currently Black is also doing the wrong thing.\r\n\r\n### Needs changing\r\n\r\nThe explicit PEP 8 recommendation is:\r\n\r\n**YES**:\r\n```py3\r\nham[lower + offset : upper + offset]\r\nham[: upper_fn(x) : step_fn(x)], ham[:: step_fn(x)]\r\n```\r\n\r\n~NO~:\r\n```\r\nham[lower + offset:upper + offset]\r\nham[:upper_fn(x):step_fn(x)], ham[::step_fn(x)]\r\n```\r\n\r\nEssentially, we should treat `:` as an \"operator\" inside slices when any operand of the slice includes punctuation (dots, brackets, and other math, binary or logic operators).\r\n\r\nMore examples:\r\n**YES**\r\n```py3\r\nham[lower * unit + offset * unit : upper * unit + offset * unit]\r\n```\r\n\r\n~NO~:\r\n```\r\nham[lower*unit+offset*unit : upper*unit+offset*unit]\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote that PEP 8 allows for the following that [we cannot properly enforce](https://github.com/ambv/black/issues/148):\r\n```\r\nham[lower+offset : upper+offset]\r\n```\r\n\r\nBlack won't do that because \"lower\", \"upper\", or \"offset\" can be arbitrary complexity and then operator hugging isn't improving readability anymore.\r\n\r\n### Already well formatted\r\nBlack is already formatting the other PEP 8 recommendation well:\r\n\r\n**YES**:\r\n```py3\r\nham[1:9], ham[1:9:3], ham[:9:3], ham[1::3], ham[1:9:]\r\nham[lower:upper], ham[lower:upper:], ham[lower::step]\r\n```\r\n\r\n~NO~:\r\n```\r\nham[1: 9], ham[1 :9], ham[1:9 :3]\r\nham[lower : : upper]\r\nham[ : upper]\r\n```\r\n\r\n(edited: a previous version of this issue suggested hugging operators but I since realized this cannot be performed

an odd bit of formatting that black gave me, using black on latest master with `-l 79`:\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef test_foo():\r\n    expected = (\r\n        [(\"before_run\",)]\r\n        + 6\r\n        * [(\"schedule\", task), (\"before\", task), (\"after\", task)]\r\n        + [(\"after_run\",)]\r\n    )\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is weird because the `*` binds more tightly than the `+`, so it's actually 6 copies of that list. If I add explicit parentheses around the `*` operation, then black gives me the much more sensible:\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef test_foo():\r\n    expected = (\r\n        [(\"before_run\",)]\r\n        + (6 * [(\"schedule\", task), (\"before\", task), (\"after\", task)])\r\n        + [(\"after_run\",)]\r\n    )\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo that's a workaround, but maybe black should realize that `*` binds more tightly than `+` and treat the first case the same way as it treats the parenthesized case? Or insert parentheses, or... something? It feels like black has enough information here to do something better.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/psf/black/issues/169/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/psf/black/issues/169/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/psf/black/issues/comments/384184113","html_url":"https://github.com/psf/black/issues/148#issuecomment-384184113","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/psf/black/issues/148","id":384184113,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM4NDE4NDExMw==","user":{"login":"njsmith","id":609896,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYwOTg5Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/609896?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/njsmith","html_url":"https://github.com/njsmith","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/njsmith/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/njsmith/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/njsmith/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/njsmith/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/njsmith/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/njsmith/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/njsmith/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/njsmith/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/njsmith/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-04-25T07:14:43Z","updated_at":"2018-04-25T07:14:43Z","body":"One way to handle the operator hugging would be to preserve the user's choice of hugging-or-not, *if* it's consistent with precedence.

really like black and have switched to it exclusively. I don't like having to think about the formatting. It just does it. But I have a problem with the way it w\r\n\r\nI do a lot of work with equations and would like to provide an example. I do a lot of prototyping in Jupyter for other developers to base there work off. It is more important for my code to look as close to the latex as possible to help minimize errors and make it easier to read - from a mathematics perspective. Not only for the developers but the other non-coder experts.\r\n\r\nI was taught that there is no spacing around multiplication and division. It follows that there is no spacing around exponentiation because it is a shorthand way to express multiplication. According to the AMA (https://www.amamanualofstyle.com/view/10.1093/jama/9780195176339.001.0001/med-9780195176339-div1-230), there is indeed spacing between the explicit operators. I don't think that is a problem for relatively simple equations. More complex equations that is different.\r\n\r\nIs there a way to add an option to Black that could be \"Math\" mode that would allow this type of formatting to be preserved? I suppose it could be a problem when applied to a module that contained a mixture of mathematical formalism and regular code, but I think that would be a trade-off for people that would use it.\r\n\r\nAs an example, here is a method that I wrote to calculate the material properties of rocks (NOTE: the variable names fall in-line with the field, and those are acceptable names and can easily be found in the literature)\r\n\r\nBefore Black:\r\n\r\n```\r\ndef nu_k_model(rho=None, nu=None, K=None):\r\n    \"\"\"\r\n    A function that will calculate all of the elastic properties of the rock given:\r\n    - The density         (rho)\r\n    - Poisson's Ratio     (nu)\r\n    - Bulk Modulus        (K)\r\n    \r\n\r\n    Parameters\r\n    ----------\r\n    rho         - number - Rock density       (kg/m^3)\r\n    nu          - number - Poisson's Ratio    (unitless) \r\n    K           - number - Bulk Modulus       (Pa)\r\n        \r\n\r\n    Returns\r\n    -------\r\n    A tupple containing the following, in that order:\r\n\r\n    vp     - number - P-wave velocity    (m/s) \r\n    vs     - number - S-wave velocity    (m/s)\r\n    gamma  - number - Velocity Ratio     (unitless)\r\n    lambda - number - 1st Lamé Parameter (Pa) <- cannot use lambda as a name (reserved) using lame instead\r\n    K      - number - Bulk Modulus       (Pa)\r\n    E      - number - Young's Modulus    (Pa) \r\n    mu     - number - Shear Modulus      (Pa)\r\n    nu     - number - Poisson's Ratio    (unitless) \r\n    M      - number - P-wave Modulus     (Pa)\r\n\r\n    \"\"\"    \r\n    \r\n    vp = np.sqrt((3*K*(1 - nu))/(rho*(1 + nu)))\r\n    \r\n    vs = np.sqrt(-1*(3*K*(2*nu - 1))/(2*rho*(nu + 1)))\r\n    \r\n    gamma = np.sqrt((2*nu - 2)/(2*nu - 1))\r\n    \r\n    lame = (3*K*nu)/(1 + nu)\r\n    \r\n    E = 3*K*(1 - 2*nu)\r\n    \r\n    mu = (3*K*(1 - 2*nu))/(2*(1 + nu))\r\n        \r\n    M = (3*K*(1 - nu))/(1 + nu)\r\n\r\n    return vp, vs, gamma, lame, K, E, mu, nu, M \r\n```\r\n\r\n---- \r\n\r\nHere it is after black:\r\n\r\n```\r\ndef nu_k_model(rho=None, nu=None, K=None):\r\n   \r\n    vp = np.sqrt((3 * K * (1 - nu)) / (rho * (1 + nu)))\r\n\r\n    vs = np.sqrt(-1 * (3 * K * (2 * nu - 1)) / (2 * rho * (nu + 1)))\r\n\r\n    gamma = np.sqrt((2 * nu - 2) / (2 * nu - 1))\r\n\r\n    lame = (3 * K * nu) / (1 + nu)\r\n\r\n    E = 3 * K * (1 - 2 * nu)\r\n\r\n    mu = (3 * K * (1 - 2 * nu)) / (2 * (1 + nu))\r\n\r\n    M = (3 * K * (1 - nu)) / (1 + nu)\r\n\r\n    return vp, vs, gamma, lame, K, E, mu, nu, M\r\n```\r\nHere is the latex for some of the equations. If you render them you'll notice very little space between the multiplication:\r\n``` latex\r\n$V_{P} = \\sqrt{\\frac{3K(1 - \\nu)}{\\rho(1 + \\nu)}}$   \r\n$V_{S} = \\sqrt{-\\frac{3K(2\\nu - 1)}{2\\rho (\\nu + 1)}}$\r\n$\\mu = \\frac{3K(1-2\\nu)}{2(1+\\nu)}$\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhat I am trying to do is make sure that this:\r\n\r\nvp = np.sqrt((3*K*(1 - nu))/(rho*(1 + nu)))\r\n\r\nLooks as close to this as possible:\r\n$V_{P} = \\sqrt{\\frac{3K(1 - \\nu)}{\\rho(1 + \\nu)}}$

the latest development version of PennyLane, we now support returning `samples` from the QNode, as well as expectation values and variance:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n@qml.qnode(dev)\r\ndef circuit(x):\r\n    qml.RX(x, wires=0)\r\n    qml.CNOT(wires=[0, 1])\r\n    return expval(qml.PauliZ(0)), sample(qml.PauliZ(1))\r\n```\r\n\r\nPlugins can support this new feature by subclassing the `Device.sample()` method, returning the requested number of samples for a given observable.\r\n\r\n**Description of changes:**\r\n\r\n* Adds support for returning samples from `wavefunction`, `numpy_wavefunction`, `QVM`, and `QPU` devices.\r\n\r\n* Adds tests for samples\r\n\r\n* The tolerance on a couple of other (stochastic) tests was increased, to avoid frequent failures.\r\n\r\n**Benefits:**\r\n\r\n* A user can train/optimize a hybrid classical-quantum computation, and then, once trained, easily switch the model to generate samples rather than deterministic expectation values/variances.\r\n\r\n* This significantly simplifies the code required to compute expectations and variances on hardware. Previously, probabilities had to be computed for multi-qubit observables. Now, we can simply call `np.mean(self.samples())` and `np.var(self.samples())`.\r\n\r\n**Drawbacks:** n/a","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PennyLaneAI/pennylane-rigetti/issues/18/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/PennyLaneAI/pennylane-rigetti/issues/18/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
