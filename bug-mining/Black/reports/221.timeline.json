Description\r\n\r\nOver here, https://github.com/psf/black/issues/3453#issuecomment-1357988758 while fixing an issue with the Docker image publishing workflow, it seemed there's a legitimate desire for a docker tag which follows alpha (prerelease) releases of Black. This PR creates a new tag to be pushed to Docker Hub going forward (`latest_prerelease` which will be updated with every alpha version release.\r\n\r\n**I do have another change to request along with this...**\r\n\r\nIf someone comes across the official Black image on Docker Hub, the description is a shortened version of the README with a link to the full docs. There isn't an obvious pointer to the documentation of which Docker image tags are in use and for what purpose. I don't think duplicating the information there is necessarily the right way to go (unless it's sourced in this repository), but having another explicit link to that specific docs page would grease the wheels just a bit for folks discovering it on Docker Hub.\r\n\r\nI don't see where in the source code that Description on DockerHub is maintained, and so I think it's probably been manually set by a maintainer. Linking to Black's Full Documentation still makes sense to me, but I think an additional line just above that would be helpful, something like the following:\r\n\r\n> Official Docker Image Documentation: https://black.readthedocs.io/en/latest/usage_and_configuration/black_docker_image.html\r\n\r\n### Checklist - did you ...\r\n\r\n- [X] Add an entry in `CHANGES.md` if necessary?\r\n- [X] Add / update tests if necessary?
