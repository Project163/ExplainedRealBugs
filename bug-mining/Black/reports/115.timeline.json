#593\r\n\r\nI looked into this bug with @ambv and @carljm, and we reached the conclusion was that it's not possible for the tokenizer to determine if async/await is a keyword inside all possible generators without breaking the grammar for older versions of Python.\r\n\r\nInstead, we introduce a new tokenizer mode for Python 3.7+ that will cause all async/await instances to get parsed as a reserved keyword, which should fix async/await inside generators.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/psf/black/issues/845/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/psf/black/issues/845/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":2330706094,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MjMzMDcwNjA5NA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/psf/black/issues/events/2330706094","actor":{"login":"ambv","id":55281,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1Mjgx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55281?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambv","html_url":"https://github.com/ambv","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambv/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambv/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambv/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambv/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambv/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambv/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambv/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambv/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambv/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":"f8617f975d56e81cfb4070ce65584f7b29a77e7a","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/psf/black/commits/f8617f975d56e81cfb4070ce65584f7b29a77e7a","created_at":"2019-05-09T16:01:17Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
