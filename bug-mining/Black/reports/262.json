Sometimes you call Black and it works. Sometimes you call, and it chokes\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\n\r\nVisit an M1 MacBook and feed these 4 Lines of Python Code into Black\r\n\r\nFor example, take these 4 Lines, formatted exactly as shown\r\n\r\n```python\r\nimport argparse\r\nimport string\r\n\r\n\r\nS1 = f\"{argparse.OPTIONAL[:9]=}\"\r\nS2 = (string.ascii_uppercase + string.ascii_lowercase)\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd try calling Black, more than once, on this same input with no arguments\r\n\r\n```sh\r\nblack file.py\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe resulting error is:\r\n\r\n> INTERNAL ERROR: Black produced code that is not equivalent\r\n\r\nIt drops the : 9 ] = part of the F String Slice. Oops\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\n\r\nNo Internal Error\r\n\r\n**Environment**\r\n\r\n- Black's version:  24.8.0 (compiled: yes)\r\n- OS and Python version: Python (CPython) 3.12.5 at macOS 14.6.1 23G93 on Apple M1 Pro Chip inside MacBook Pro 16-inch, 2021\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\n\r\nBelow is a Terminal transcript of reproducing this occasional Internal Error\r\n\r\nLook closely and you'll see some runs on the same input fail like this, but some runs don't fail. This bug combines ( a ) that the results can and are inconsistent, and ( b ) that some of the results are Internal Errors\r\n\r\n```\r\n(PIPS) % \r\n(PIPS) % \r\n(PIPS) % cp -p p1.py p2.py && black p2.py\r\nerror: cannot format p2.py: INTERNAL ERROR: Black produced code that is not equivalent to the source.
