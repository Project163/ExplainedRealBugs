When `.gitignore` is invalid, Black crashes with a confusing `IndexError` exception and it's not obvious that the `.gitignore` file is the issue. This is worsen by the fact, it's non-obvious Black uses `.gitignore` at all (maintainer note: it's been documented so it's fine, just describing how this is even worse of a problem than at first glance).\r\n\r\nThis is also a problem if say reading fails for some reason.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\n\r\n<!-- A clear and concise description of what you want to\r\nhappen. -->\r\n\r\nIf an exception is raised within the `get_gitignore` function, capture it and present a more user-friendly error without an unnecessary traceback and with a quick mention of `.gitignore`.\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\n\r\n<!-- A clear and concise description of any\r\nalternative solutions or features you've considered. -->\r\n\r\n- Continue operation even if `.gitignore` can't be parsed, just emit a warning and go on (fine, but I'm hesitant)\r\n- Stop using `.gitignore` automatically (probably too much disruption potential)\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\n\r\n<!-- Add any other context or screenshots about the feature request\r\nhere. -->\r\n\r\nI thought of this when triaging https://github.com/psf/black/issues/2351.","closed_by":{"login":"ichard26","id":63936253,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzOTM2MjUz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/63936253?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ichard26","html_url":"https://github.com/ichard26","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ichard26/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ichard26/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ichard26/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ichard26/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ichard26/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ichard26/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ichard26/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ichard26/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ichard26/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/psf/black/issues/2359/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/psf/black/issues/2359/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
