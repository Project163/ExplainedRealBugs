In the _Black Code Style_ section of the documentation there is a section describing future style guidelines for the `.pyi` files: [Typing Stub Files](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/the_black_code_style/current_style.html#typing-stub-files).\r\n\r\n**Description**\r\n<!-- A clear and concise description of how the style can be\r\nimproved. -->\r\n\r\nThe point I wish to argue against today is the line: \"do not use docstrings\". I imagine this is referring to a Python stub file that is providing type hints for another Python file, like so: \r\n_add.py_\r\n```Python\r\ndef add(a, b):\r\n    \" here's an existing docstring\"\r\n    return a + b\r\n```\r\n_add.pyi_\r\n```python\r\ndef add(a: int, b: int) -> int:\r\n    \" here's another stub file docstring\"\r\n    ...\r\n```\r\nIn which case, it would make sense to either include the docstring in one file or the other. \r\n\r\nHowever, the edge case I wish to bring to your attention is when using C/C++ extensions for Python code. In particular I will discuss the use of [PyBind11](https://pybind11.readthedocs.io/en/stable/basics.html). PyBind11 produces a shared library with a name such as `add.cpython-38-x86_64-linux-gnu.so`, which contains inside it Python objects that you can import as any other Python object. However, modern Intellisense servers like [Pylance](https://github.com/microsoft/pylance-release) do not extract information from binary files by [design](https://github.com/microsoft/pylance-release/issues/70), and therefore you _cannot_ get any documentation from a binary file, be this docstrings or type information. \r\n\r\nTherefore, a stub file can be used to make up for the design limitation, but you need to include docstrings in the stub file in order to get useful information about a function written with PyBind11. \r\n\r\n_add_pybind11.py_\r\n```python\r\n# import the add function from a PyBind11 produced binary\r\nimport add from _add_pybind11\r\n\r\n# the above will generate no intellisense due to the design limitation of tools like pylance\r\n```\r\n\r\n_add_pybind11.pyi_\r\n```python\r\n# define the docstring and type information for the C/C++ bound object\r\ndef add(a: int, b: int) -> int:\r\n    \" This function was generated by pybind11 and therefore needs a stub file to use with intellisense\"\r\n    ...\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Conclusion**\r\nI'd like to offer the example of using stub files with binary libraries, such as those produced by PyBind11, as a reason to allow docstrings in stub files in future versions of the formatter. This can be with a flag or configuration, but rest assured having Black delete my docstrings for my PyBind11 objects would cause headaches. \r\n\r\n<!-- Add any other context about the problem here. -->\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/29968424/159010748-6203be64-527a-4d0b-a2f7-401da9023014.png)\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"JelleZijlstra","id":906600,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkwNjYwMA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/906600?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra","html_url":"https://github.com/JelleZijlstra","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/psf/black/issues/2938/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/psf/black/issues/2938/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
