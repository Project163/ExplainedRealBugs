Description\r\n\r\nFix #4107 by updating hatchling  ~~in a fairly hacky way though.~~\r\n\r\nHatch ~~will~~ used to strip out parenthesis in the extras if it thinks it doesn't need them and wouldn't add them back in. ~~:( We can, however, add a meaningless restriction like `and python_version >= '1'` to force hatch to use our parenthesis. Extremely hacky, and I would understand if we don't want this to be merged until a cleaner hatch fix is upstream. Also happy to come up with another way of essentially just having `true` in the spec, but I couldn't find one with a quick reading of https://peps.python.org/pep-0508/.~~\r\n\r\n### Checklist - did you ...\r\n\r\n<!-- If any of the following items aren't relevant for your contribution\r\n     please still tick them so we know you've gone through the checklist.\r\n\r\n    All user-facing changes should get an entry.

that appeared in `black`'s packaging is that if you have a environment marker with an `or`, i.e.\r\n\r\n```toml\r\n[project.optional-dependencies]\r\nd = [\r\n  \"aiohttp>=3.7.4; sys_platform != 'win32' or implementation_name != 'pypy'\",\r\n]\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen `hatchling` will naively add the `and extra == 'd' to the end of that spec, even if the `and` has a higher precedence than the original `or` had. I.e. in the generated metadata, there'll be a:\r\n\r\n```\r\nProvides-Extra: d\r\nRequires-Dist: aiohttp>=3.7.4; sys_platform != 'win32' or implementation_name != 'pypy' and extra == 'd'\r\n```\r\n\r\nThat statement will always get evaluated as true on non-windows systems, so the dependency will be installed, even if the user didn't choose to install that extra.\r\n\r\nI think the easy fix is to always add parenthesis, even if they might not be needed. They aren't too much noise, and make the METADATA in the wheel (whoever is reading it) a bit easier to read. So the output would look like:\r\n\r\n```\r\nProvides-Extra: d\r\nRequires-Dist: aiohttp>=3.7.4; (sys_platform != 'win32' or implementation_name != 'pypy') and extra == 'd'\r\n```\r\n\r\nOriginally ran into this issue in https://github.com/psf/black/issues/4107. For some reason that I can't tell, `hatch` will remove the parenthesis around the env marker if it's the most outer characters. There's a very hacky work around that involves adding an extra useless specifier (see https://github.com/psf/black/pull/4108/files#diff-50c86b7ed8ac2cf95bd48334961bf0530cdc77b5a56f852c5c61b89d735fd711R79), but I think an upstream fix would be nice. I have a PR that I'm running tests on, and will open right after they pass.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pypa/hatch/issues/1131/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pypa/hatch/issues/1131/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"actor":{"login":"EliahKagan","id":1771172,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NzExNzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1771172?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/EliahKagan","html_url":"https://github.com/EliahKagan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EliahKagan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EliahKagan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EliahKagan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EliahKagan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EliahKagan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EliahKagan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EliahKagan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EliahKagan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EliahKagan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-12-13T05:40:14Z","updated_at":"2023-12-13T05:40:14Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/gitpython-developers/GitPython/issues/1766","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/gitpython-developers/GitPython","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/gitpython-developers/GitPython/issues/1766/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/gitpython-developers/GitPython/issues/1766/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/gitpython-developers/GitPython/issues/1766/events","html_url":"https://github.com/gitpython-developers/GitPython/pull/1766","id":2037696849,"node_id":"PR_kwDOABEux85hyjqh","number":1766,"title":"Don't

makes the `black` test dependency apply only to systems *other* than Cygwin. It does not block `black` from being separately installed. It does not reconfigure or otherwise affect pre-commit hooks. This is to work around a problem where the newest stable version of `black` fails to install on Cygwin. Pinning `black` to the previous stable version specifically on Cygwin would also work, but this is simpler and it is not obvious that there is much of a benefit to installing `black` (automatically) on Cygwin.\r\n\r\nAs of black 23.12.0 and [as seen](https://github.com/gitpython-developers/GitPython/actions/runs/7181278013/job/19555344996) in #1765 ([d70ba69](https://github.com/gitpython-developers/GitPython/pull/1765/commits/d70ba6941cf0f005f3f247c70233f51a0cc35969)), installing `black` builds a wheel on Cygwin, downloading dependencies for the \"d\" extra (i.e., `black[d]`), which provides dependencies for running the `blackd` daemon. This includes dependencies, such as `asyncio`, whose compilation fails on CI as it is currently set up, fails under some common Cygwin setups (since it needs a C compiler, the Python headers, and possibly other dependencies), and even if successful would cause the Cygwin test workflow to take significantly longer to run. This consistently occurs on this project's CI and on my local Cygwin setup.\r\n\r\nA better solution may be preferred, especially if some users are actually running black on Cygwin (though it can be installed at a previous version, if acceptable, in the virtual environment). So this may be viewed as a stopgap measure until a better solution is put in place.\r\n\r\nI do not know if the problem is due to a bug in Black. Although [some changes have been made](https://github.com/psf/black/compare/23.11.0...23.12.0) in Black's `pyproject.toml` since the previous release, including to its dependencies in the \"d\" group, it does not look like these changes should cause this to happen. Inspection of the available wheels on PyPI for both versions ([23.11.0](https://pypi.org/project/black/23.11.0/#files), [23.12.0](https://pypi.org/project/black/23.12.0/#files)) also does not point to an obvious explanation, though I could be missing something.\r\n\r\nIt seems no similar situation occurs on other systems, even with Python 3.9 (the version this project tests with on Cygwin).","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/gitpython-developers/GitPython/issues/1766/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/gitpython-developers/GitPython/issues/1766/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/psf/black/issues/comments/1853616470","html_url":"https://github.com/psf/black/issues/4107#issuecomment-1853616470","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/psf/black/issues/4107","id":1853616470,"node_id":"IC_kwDOB3dpmM5ue_FW","user":{"login":"sigma67","id":16363825,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MzYzODI1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16363825?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sigma67","html_url":"https://github.com/sigma67","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sigma67/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sigma67/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sigma67/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sigma67/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sigma67/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sigma67/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sigma67/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sigma67/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sigma67/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-12-13T10:05:23Z","updated_at":"2023-12-13T10:05:23Z","body":"`isort`

here:\r\nhttps://github.com/psf/black/compare/23.11.0...23.12.0#diff-50c86b7ed8ac2cf95bd48334961bf0530cdc77b5a56f852c5c61b89d735fd711R79-R80\r\n> ```diff\r\n> d = [\r\n> -  \"aiohttp>=3.7.4\",\r\n> +

it.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/psf/black/issues/4120/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/psf/black/issues/4120/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"actor":{"login":"rsebille","id":20045330,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwMDQ1MzMw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20045330?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rsebille","html_url":"https://github.com/rsebille","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rsebille/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rsebille/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rsebille/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rsebille/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rsebille/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rsebille/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rsebille/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rsebille/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rsebille/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-12-20T15:16:04Z","updated_at":"2023-12-20T15:16:04Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/gip-inclusion/les-emplois/issues/3476","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/gip-inclusion/les-emplois","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/gip-inclusion/les-emplois/issues/3476/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/gip-inclusion/les-emplois/issues/3476/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/gip-inclusion/les-emplois/issues/3476/events","html_url":"https://github.com/gip-inclusion/les-emplois/pull/3476","id":2046644248,"node_id":"PR_kwDOC9CkMM5iQ0CN","number":3476,"title":"requirement:

we'll put out an alpha release 24.1a1 showcasing the draft\n2024 stable style, which we'll finalize in the January release. Please try it out and\n<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/psf/black/issues/4042\">share your feedback</a>.</p>\n<p>This release (23.12.0) will still produce the 2023 style. Most but not all of the\nchanges in <code>--preview</code> mode will be in the 2024 stable style.</p>\n<h3>Stable style</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Fix bug where <code># fmt: off</code> automatically dedents when used with the <code>--line-ranges</code>\noption, even when it is not within the specified line range.
