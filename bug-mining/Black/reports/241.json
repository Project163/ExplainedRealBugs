To confirm this, you have three options:\r\n\r\n1. Update Black's version if a newer release exists: `pip install -U black`\r\n2. Use the online formatter at <https://black.vercel.app/?version=main>, which will use\r\n   the latest main branch.\r\n3. Or run _Black_ on your machine:\r\n   - create a new virtualenv (make sure it's the same Python version);\r\n   - clone this repository;\r\n   - run `pip install -e .[d]`;\r\n   - run `pip install -r test_requirements.txt`\r\n   - make sure it's sane by running `python -m pytest`; and\r\n   - run `black` like you did last time.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n**Describe the bug**\r\n\r\nGiven the following code:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n@decor(\r\n    a = 1,\r\n    # fmt: off\r\n    b = (2, 3),\r\n    # fmt: on\r\n)\r\ndef func():\r\n    pass\r\n```\r\n\r\nRun black with\r\n\r\n```sh\r\n$ black --line-ranges=8-8 file.py\r\n```\r\n\r\nLine 8 is `pass`, and the file will be formatted to:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n@decor(\r\n    a = 1,\r\n# fmt: off\r\n    b = (2, 3),\r\n    # fmt: on\r\n)\r\ndef func():\r\n    pass\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\n\r\nNo formatting changes.\r\n\r\n**Environment**\r\n\r\n- Black's version: [main]\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\n\r\nI'll take a look at this, I think we need to save additional info when code is converted to `STANDALONE_COMMENT` for `# fmt: off/skip` markers before we convert lines outside of `--line-ranges=` to `STANDALONE_COMMENT`.","closed_by":{"login":"JelleZijlstra","id":906600,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkwNjYwMA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/906600?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra","html_url":"https://github.com/JelleZijlstra","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/psf/black/issues/4068/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/psf/black/issues/4068/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
