change slightly updates black's comment formatting logic for a non-PEP8 edge case frequently encountered in HPC batch schedulers. \r\n\r\nThese tools use block comments that immediately follow the `#!` header to provide default configuration parameters for a batch scheduler of the form [`#SBATCH`](https://slurm.schedmd.com/sbatch.html) or [`#PBS`](http://docs.adaptivecomputing.com/torque/4-0-2/Content/topics/commands/qsub.htm) and, unfortunately, don't support a pep8 compatible `# SBATCH` or `# PBS` syntax.\r\n\r\nThis change special cases comments beginning with these directives, as there isn't a clear way to resolve these requirements within black's existing syntax. As the directive *must* follow the shebang, `# fmt: off` escape hatches aren't a viable solution and (interestingly) don't prevent block comment reformatting in black's current implementation.\r\n\r\nThough this is a low-usage edge case, I hope the precedent from https://github.com/psf/black/issues/68 will apply.
