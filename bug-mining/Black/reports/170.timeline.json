Just to be sure it's not about the same thing #2284 is, I also tried out the changes from #2292 (since they apparently fix some edge cases that weren't fixed by #2286.\r\nAlso, the original code actually contained f-string but to rule out that it has anything to do with #2293, I changed it to use regular strings which as you can see from the issue description didn't change the end result.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/psf/black/issues/2294/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/psf/black/issues/2294/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
