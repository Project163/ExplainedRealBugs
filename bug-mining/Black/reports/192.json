Please describe.**\r\n\r\nBlack should normalize the prefix used for raw f-strings (https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0498/#raw-f-strings). Both `rf` and `fr` work, but one should be preferred.\r\n\r\nCurrently, the following code is not changed:\r\n\r\n```\r\n    f = rf\"hello {world}\"\r\n    f = fr\"hello {world}\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\n\r\nPick one and normalize. I don't really care which. `rf` matches the name \"raw f-string\", but `fr` matches the example in PEP-498 and Jupyterlab syntax highlighting seems to prefer it.\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\n\r\nDoing nothing leaves open the opportunity for inconsistency and disagreement.\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\n\r\nNone\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"JelleZijlstra","id":906600,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkwNjYwMA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/906600?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra","html_url":"https://github.com/JelleZijlstra","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/psf/black/issues/2171/reactions","total_count":3,"+1":3,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/psf/black/issues/2171/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
