the bug**\r\n\r\nThe README says:\r\n\r\n> Also, as a temporary safety measure, Black will check that the reformatted code still produces a valid AST that is equivalent to the original. This slows it down. If you're feeling confident, use `--fast`.\r\n\r\nBut after #1740, docstrings beginning with a double quote have an extra space prepended to them. This produces a different AST than the file had before, but `--safe` doesn't complain about this.\r\n\r\nIs Black no longer promising to produce identical ASTs?\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\n\r\n```console\r\n$ cat test.py\r\ndef foo():\r\n    '''\"something\" is what this does.'''\r\n\r\n\r\nprint(foo.__doc__)\r\n$ python test.py\r\n\"something\" is what this does.\r\n$ black --safe test.py\r\nreformatted test.py\r\nAll done! ✨ 🍰 ✨\r\n1 file reformatted.\r\n$ cat test.py\r\ndef foo():\r\n    \"\"\" \"something\" is what this does.\"\"\"\r\n\r\n\r\nprint(foo.__doc__)\r\n$ python test.py\r\n \"something\" is what this does.\r\n$\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**:\r\n\r\nI believe that `black` is never supposed to change the AST, and therefore rewriting the docstring to contain this extra space is not a valid transformation for `black` to perform.\r\n\r\n**Environment:**\r\n\r\n- Version: `black, version 21.4b0`\r\n- OS and Python version: Linux, Python 3.8.8\r\n\r\n**Does this bug also happen on master?**\r\n\r\nYes\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\n\r\n```console\r\n$ python -m ast test.py >ast1.out\r\n$ black test.py\r\nreformatted test.py\r\nAll done! ✨ 🍰 ✨\r\n1 file reformatted.\r\n$ python -m ast test.py >ast2.out\r\n$ diff -U0 ast1.out ast2.out\r\n--- ast1.out    2021-04-26 19:05:58.174110800 -0400\r\n+++ ast2.out    2021-04-26 19:08:57.324110800 -0400\r\n@@ -13 +13 @@\r\n-               value=Constant(value='\"something\" is what this does.'))],\r\n+               value=Constant(value=' \"something\" is what this does.'))],\r\n```","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/psf/black/issues/2150/reactions","total_count":4,"+1":4,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/psf/black/issues/2150/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/psf/black/issues/comments/829606487","html_url":"https://github.com/psf/black/issues/2168#issuecomment-829606487","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/psf/black/issues/2168","id":829606487,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDgyOTYwNjQ4Nw==","user":{"login":"JelleZijlstra","id":906600,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkwNjYwMA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/906600?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra","html_url":"https://github.com/JelleZijlstra","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-04-29T21:24:57Z","updated_at":"2021-04-29T21:24:57Z","body":"See #2150 for some similar previous discussion.
