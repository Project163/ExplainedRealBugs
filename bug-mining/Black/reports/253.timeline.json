Secondly, yeah for now #2525 (PR for 1826) should work by adding `config = \"../pyproject.toml` to `sub1/pyproject.toml`.\r\n\r\nThis is also an issue when you are working with mono repo, say you have `black` as a repository with `blib2to3` as separate repositories within `black`. Now, if you are in `blib2to3` and the black config is outside in the root directory `black`, it would never go beyond `blib2to3` as it exists after finding a `.git` folder inside it.\r\n\r\nA possible solution to this would be to go through all the `common_base.parents` and find the ones which fulfil the condition of `.git/.hg/pyproject.toml`. Now you check for `pyproject.toml` in them and see if they are valid, and you return the first path which has valid `pyproject.toml`. Okay, this is a bit confusing ig, so say if you have:\r\n```\r\n/, /home/, /home/shivansh/, /home/shivansh/oss/, /home/shivansh/oss/black, /home/shivansh/oss/black/blib2to3\r\n```\r\nas the `common_base.parents`, now if you check for those which fulfil the conditions, and you get\r\n```\r\n/home/shivansh/oss/, /home/shivansh/oss/black, /home/shivansh/oss/black/blib2to3\r\n```\r\nyou check for valid `pyproject.toml` and get `oss/` and `oss/black` have valid configs, but since `oss/black` is \"higher\" you return that. If none of them is valid, you return the as-it-is root which would be `blib2to3`, if you have no path fulfilling the condition, the root is `/` as we have now.\r\n\r\nNote: This is only for finding the config, the src root would stay the same as now.\r\n\r\nWell yeah, this has the same problem as Felix mentioned, where you would need to have an empty black config in case you want to have an empty config.\r\n\r\n--- \r\n\r\nThe second solution, I can think of is to have no special case for this and just make the users link `config=` (#2525) to the \"actual\" root config. I am slightly leaning towards this for simplicity.\r\n\r\n","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/psf/black/issues/comments/1028936574/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"Shivansh-007","id":69356296,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY5MzU2Mjk2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/69356296?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Shivansh-007","html_url":"https://github.com/Shivansh-007","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Shivansh-007/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Shivansh-007/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Shivansh-007/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Shivansh-007/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Shivansh-007/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Shivansh-007/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Shivansh-007/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Shivansh-007/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Shivansh-007/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/psf/black/issues/comments/1029258002","html_url":"https://github.com/psf/black/issues/2863#issuecomment-1029258002","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/psf/black/issues/2863","id":1029258002,"node_id":"IC_kwDOB3dpmM49WTsS","user":{"login":"cooperlees","id":3005596,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwMDU1OTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3005596?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cooperlees","html_url":"https://github.com/cooperlees","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cooperlees/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cooperlees/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cooperlees/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cooperlees/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cooperlees/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cooperlees/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cooperlees/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cooperlees/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cooperlees/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-02-03T18:04:34Z","updated_at":"2022-02-03T18:05:08Z","body":"I feel we should only find the first pyproject.toml in the hierarchy and just error that there is no black config in the file we find.

It would improve the current situation and it is explicit (even if slightly more verbose).\r\n\r\nWhat I meant was that the assumption that black config is and should be in the first encountered `pyproject.toml` might be surprising to the user. In this vain raising an error as @cooperlees is proposing is also surprising, at least to me. I mean, wouldn't it be surprising to you when you have your tool X config in exactly one place in the same directory you're invoking that tool from and it doesn't get picked up?\r\n\r\nI guess (and I might be entirely off here, so correct me if needed or ignore this paragraph) the problem origins from the facts that (a) mono-repo layouts weren't considered when black was being conceived and (b) back in the day black was one of the few tools that was using `pyproject.toml` file for config, so I guess its assumption was \"oh, I see this file, no one else probably cares about it, so my config must be in there\". Yes, I've just anthropomorphised black 😄.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, it's hard to find consistency in other tools for this behaviour. I personally like the way `isort` discovers config. Mypy for example doesn't even go beyond current working directory when searching for config.

also find it pretty problematic in a monorepo setup:\r\n- pre-commit hook doesn't work as you can expect unless you provide `--config` flag explicitly, which can be really confusing (it took me a while to understand why files are formatted with no respect to the config), but when you specify it eventually - it works fine\r\n- VS Code is more problematic - here you also have to specify `Python › Formatting: Black Args` explicitly, but that's more tricky because there's no obvious way to share the config with your team - workspace-level settings.json is not universal, so you need to create sth like settings.json.default and tell people to include manually / with some custom script the settings specified there in their own config. That's ofc doable, but it's a pretty annoying experience for new-comers.\r\n\r\nIf Black would scan all the `pyproject.toml` files up to the root of a monorepo - nothing from the above would be needed. And empty Black section in `pyproject.toml` as a way to say \"don't scan further, just use Black defaults\" should provide pretty smooth experience.\r\n\r\nEDIT: I just had a look at #2525 - that should also be fine, I can handle specifying the path during project generation with `cookiecutter` then. It would be nice to be able to specify the path also from the project root, not only relatively, but I understand that would complicate the setup. @Shivansh-007 - is that PR expected to be merged

soon?","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/psf/black/issues/comments/1067606328/reactions","total_count":5,"+1":5,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"jaklan","id":24907857,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0OTA3ODU3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24907857?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jaklan","html_url":"https://github.com/jaklan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jaklan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jaklan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jaklan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jaklan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jaklan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jaklan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jaklan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jaklan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jaklan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":6240618608,"node_id":"MEE_lADOB3dpmM5C74ZFzwAAAAFz-Ehw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/psf/black/issues/events/6240618608","actor":{"login":"Shivansh-007","id":69356296,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY5MzU2Mjk2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/69356296?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Shivansh-007","html_url":"https://github.com/Shivansh-007","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Shivansh-007/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Shivansh-007/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Shivansh-007/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Shivansh-007/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Shivansh-007/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Shivansh-007/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Shivansh-007/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Shivansh-007/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Shivansh-007/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-03-15T06:30:49Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":6240618617,"node_id":"SE_lADOB3dpmM5C74ZFzwAAAAFz-Eh5","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/psf/black/issues/events/6240618617","actor":{"login":"Shivansh-007","id":69356296,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY5MzU2Mjk2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/69356296?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Shivansh-007","html_url":"https://github.com/Shivansh-007","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Shivansh-007/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Shivansh-007/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Shivansh-007/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Shivansh-007/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Shivansh-007/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Shivansh-007/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Shivansh-007/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Shivansh-007/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Shivansh-007/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-03-15T06:30:49Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/psf/black/issues/comments/1067623901","html_url":"https://github.com/psf/black/issues/2863#issuecomment-1067623901","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/psf/black/issues/2863","id":1067623901,"node_id":"IC_kwDOB3dpmM4_oqXd","user":{"login":"jaklan","id":24907857,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0OTA3ODU3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24907857?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jaklan","html_url":"https://github.com/jaklan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jaklan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jaklan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jaklan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jaklan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jaklan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jaklan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jaklan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jaklan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jaklan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-03-15T06:44:25Z","updated_at":"2022-03-15T06:44:25Z","body":"@Shivansh-007
