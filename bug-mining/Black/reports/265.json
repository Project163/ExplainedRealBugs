Sorry if this is a duplicate or already discussed. I noticed something I thought was strange and probably the first thing I didn't like about black formatted code 😄 \r\n\r\nSomething like this:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nsome_kind_of_data = \"foo\"\r\nsome_other_kind_of_data = \"bar\"\r\nprint(\r\n    dict(\r\n        a=1,\r\n        b=2 if some_kind_of_data is not None else some_other_kind_of_data,  # some explanation of why this is actually necessary\r\n        c=3,\r\n    )\r\n)\r\n```\r\n\r\nUsing black (python3.7.3, black 19.10b0), becomes:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nsome_kind_of_data = \"foo\"\r\nsome_other_kind_of_data = \"bar\"\r\nprint(\r\n    dict(\r\n        a=1,\r\n        b=2\r\n        if some_kind_of_data is not None \r\n        else some_other_kind_of_data,  # some explanation of why this is actually necessary\r\n        c=3,\r\n    )\r\n)\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Desired style** How do you think _Black_ should format the above snippets:\r\n\r\nEither leave it obnoxiously long, or add parenthesis / indentation\r\n\r\n```python\r\nsome_kind_of_data = \"foo\"\r\nsome_other_kind_of_data = \"bar\"\r\nprint(\r\n    dict(\r\n        a=1,\r\n        b=(\r\n            2 if some_kind_of_data is not None else some_other_kind_of_data\r\n        ),  # some explanation of why this is actually necessary\r\n        c=3,\r\n    )\r\n)\r\n```","closed_by":{"login":"JelleZijlstra","id":906600,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkwNjYwMA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/906600?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra","html_url":"https://github.com/JelleZijlstra","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/psf/black/issues/1187/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/psf/black/issues/1187/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
