Otherwise the root will be incorrect, but it won't cause immediate problems.\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nBlack should run without dumping a stack trace. Running\r\n```\r\nblack .\r\n```\r\nsucceeds without any problems, so the above should probably perform similarly.\r\n\r\n**Environment (please complete the following information):**\r\n\r\n- Version: master\r\n- OS and Python version: Fedora 31/Python 3.7.4\r\n\r\n**Does this bug also happen on master?**\r\nyes\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nAs far as I can tell the bug is [here](https://github.com/psf/black/blob/88d12f88a97e5e4c8fd0d245df0a311e932fd1e1/src/black/__init__.py#L5834). I believe the ordering of python `Path` objects is purely alphabetical, which makes this work incorrectly -- it just gets the alphabetically first file you give it.\r\n\r\nA line like this would work better, IMO:\r\n```\r\ncommon_base = max(set.intersection(*(set(path.parents) for path in paths)), key=lambda x: x.parts)\r\n```\r\nI can make a PR to fix this.\r\n\r\nFor context, the above trace is getting triggered when running black as a pre-commit hook on a repo where both the code and some tests have been edited in the same commit. I have a linked `pyproject.toml` in my package so that I can easily access package metadata from within the software from single source of truth. This bug is preventing me from making a commit without separating out the tests (breaking CI on the first commit) or disabling pre-commit (sad!)\r\n\r\nThank you all for all the work a great tool!\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"zsol","id":66740,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2NzQw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/66740?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsol","html_url":"https://github.com/zsol","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsol/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsol/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsol/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsol/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsol/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsol/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsol/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsol/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsol/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/psf/black/issues/1493/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/psf/black/issues/1493/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
