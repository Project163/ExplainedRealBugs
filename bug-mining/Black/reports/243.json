This can cause some issues on docker containers and such where `gcc` isn't installed, as the extra dependencies (`aiohttp`, and `frozenlist`) don't seem to have wheels.\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\n\r\nOn a non-windows machine (I've done it on Ubuntu, and it also seems to happen on Linux github action runners) Make a new venv, source it, and install black:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\npython3 -m venv .venv\r\nsource .venv/bin/activate\r\npip install black\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt will install requirements from the `d` extra as well; \r\n\r\n```\r\nInstalling collected packages: platformdirs, packaging, tomli, multidict, idna, yarl, attrs, frozenlist, async-timeout, aiosignal, aiohttp, typing-extensions, click, pathspec, mypy-extensions, black\r\nSuccessfully installed aiohttp-3.9.1 aiosignal-1.3.1 async-timeout-4.0.3 attrs-23.1.0 black-23.12.0 click-8.1.7 frozenlist-1.4.0 idna-3.6 multidict-6.0.4 mypy-extensions-1.0.0 packaging-23.2 pathspec-0.12.1 platformdirs-4.1.0 tomli-2.0.1 typing-extensions-4.9.0 yarl-1.9.4\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\n\r\nIt shouldn't install with the `aiohttp`, `frozenlist`, and `multidict` dependencies.\r\n\r\n**Environment**\r\n\r\n- Black's version: 23.12.0, pip version 20.0.2\r\n- OS and Python version: Python 3.8.10, Ubuntu 20.04, though it also happens with github runners and the latest python-3 docker container on 22.04, see https://github.com/SuffolkLITLab/docassemble-AssemblyLine/actions/runs/7182833153/job/19560217190 <!-- e.g. [Linux/Python 3.7.4rc1] -->\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\n\r\nFirst seen in https://github.com/rickstaa/action-black/issues/18\r\n\r\nI think it has to do with: https://github.com/psf/black/commit/85b1c71a3445f32860d7b139ae4de4824f6ae102; in my pip logs, the new restrictions seem to show up as:\r\n\r\n```\r\nCollecting aiohttp>=3.7.4; sys_platform != \"win32\" or implementation_name != \"pypy\" and extra == \"d\"\r\n```\r\n\r\ni.e., the `extra == \"d\"` is ignored in favor of the sys platform not being windows, so the extras are always installed. I think a quick fix would be to wrap the extras in parenthesis. Happy to make a quick PR for that.\r\n\r\n<!-- Add any other context about the problem here. -->\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"hauntsaninja","id":12621235,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNjIxMjM1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12621235?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja","html_url":"https://github.com/hauntsaninja","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hauntsaninja/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/psf/black/issues/4107/reactions","total_count":4,"+1":4,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/psf/black/issues/4107/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
