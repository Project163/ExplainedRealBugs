#1809.","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/psf/black/issues/comments/723346342/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"bbugyi200","id":12310550,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMzEwNTUw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12310550?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbugyi200","html_url":"https://github.com/bbugyi200","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbugyi200/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbugyi200/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbugyi200/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbugyi200/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbugyi200/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbugyi200/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbugyi200/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbugyi200/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbugyi200/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":3969268722,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50Mzk2OTI2ODcyMg==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/psf/black/issues/events/3969268722","actor":{"login":"JelleZijlstra","id":906600,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkwNjYwMA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/906600?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra","html_url":"https://github.com/JelleZijlstra","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-11-06T23:33:32Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3969268725,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDM5NjkyNjg3MjU=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/psf/black/issues/events/3969268725","actor":{"login":"JelleZijlstra","id":906600,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkwNjYwMA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/906600?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra","html_url":"https://github.com/JelleZijlstra","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-11-06T23:33:32Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3969339734,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50Mzk2OTMzOTczNA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/psf/black/issues/events/3969339734","actor":{"login":"JelleZijlstra","id":906600,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkwNjYwMA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/906600?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra","html_url":"https://github.com/JelleZijlstra","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-11-07T00:17:24Z","state
