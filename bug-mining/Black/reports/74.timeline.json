Background\r\n\r\n- macOS 10.12\r\n- Python 3.6.4\r\n- 18.5b0 (vs 18.4a4)\r\n\r\nThis issue springs off a short twitter convo I had with @ambv, current end of thread is here: https://twitter.com/llanga/status/997721115530219520\r\n\r\nReported therein is the first example of this issue and I've since found a different one, so figured it was time to make a formal ticket.\r\n\r\n(N.B. that thread mentions `#  noqa` comments but I've determined this is not truly relevant/useful, especially given the 2nd example below which seems not a line length problem.)\r\n\r\n## Long string literals\r\n\r\nLong string literal assignment values get indented and wrapped in parenthesis, despite this not getting the line under the desired line-length.\r\n\r\nExample was this original pre-blacken line (at a relatively deep indent level):\r\n\r\n``` python\r\nerr = \"Refusing to be ambiguous: connect() kwarg '{}' was given both via regular arg and via connect_kwargs!\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nBlack 18.4a4 leaves it alone; 18.5b0 turns it into:\r\n\r\n``` python\r\nerr = (                                                                                                    \r\n    \"Refusing to be ambiguous: connect() kwarg '{}' was given both via regular arg and via connect_kwargs!\"\r\n)                                                                                                          \r\n```\r\n\r\n## `if x in y` where `y` is a multiline string\r\n\r\nThis is actually just after the above example and at same indent level - but in this case, the line was not previously longer than any defined limits so line length should not (AFAIK) have triggered (though I am thinking perhaps black is condensing it in one pass, causing it to _become_ too long, then parenthesizing the result in a second pass? then again, the string here is multiline and thus from perspective of the opening line would only be 3 chars long?)\r\n\r\nOriginal pre-black:\r\n\r\n``` python\r\nfor key in \"\"\"                           \r\n    hostname                             \r\n    port                                 \r\n    username                             \r\n\"\"\".split():                             \r\n    if key in self.connect_kwargs:       \r\n        raise ValueError(err.format(key))\r\n```\r\n\r\nAs before, black 18.4a4 makes no changes, but 18.5b0 turns it into:\r\n\r\n``` python\r\nfor (                                    \r\n    key                                  \r\n) in (                                   \r\n    \"\"\"                                  \r\n    hostname                             \r\n    port                                 \r\n    username                             \r\n\"\"\".split()                              \r\n):                                       \r\n    if key in self.connect_kwargs:       \r\n        raise ValueError(err.format(key))\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou can see that both the `x` and `y` clauses in the `for x in y` expression have become needlessly parenthesized. (The body of the `for` is untouched and just there for clarity.)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/psf/black/issues/232/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/psf/black/issues/232/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"actor":{"login":"auscompgeek","id":128854,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyODg1NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/128854?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/auscompgeek","html_url":"https://github.com/auscompgeek","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/auscompgeek/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/auscompgeek/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/auscompgeek/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/auscompgeek/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/auscompgeek/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/auscompgeek/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/auscompgeek/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/auscompgeek/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/auscompgeek/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-06-02T12:07:29Z","updated_at":"2018-06-02T12:07:29Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/psf/black/issues/291","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/psf/black","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/psf/black/issues/291/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/psf/black/issues/291/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/psf/black/issues/291/events","html_url":"https://github.com/psf/black/issues/291","id":328726833,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWUzMjg3MjY4MzM=","number":291,"title":"Suggestion
