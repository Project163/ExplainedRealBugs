If they share a prefix and they end up on the same line, they should be merged.\r\n\r\nIf you *really* want to be correct here the implementation is going to be hard in the following edge case:\r\n- two strings like `\"STR1\" \"STR2\"` *don't fit* on one line because the closing quote of STR1, the space, and the opening quote of STR2 are the 3 characters that cause the entire thing to not fit in a single line. So you will keep them on two lines.\r\n- but if you knew that it's safe to concatenate them, it would fit in a single line (without those 3 extra characters).\r\n\r\nI'm inclined not to touch this edge case since that makes it tricky where to perform the merge.\r\n\r\nAnother small edge case which I'm inclined to avoid is this:\r\n```\r\na = (\r\n    \"a\"\r\n    \"bb\"\r\n    \"ccc\"\r\n    \"dddd\"\r\n    \"eeeee\"\r\n    \"ffffff\"\r\n    \"ggggggg\"\r\n    \"hhhhhhhh\"\r\n    \"iiiiiiiii\"\r\n    \"jjjjjjjjjj\"\r\n    \"kkkkkkkkkkk\"\r\n    \"llllllllllll\"\r\n    \"mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm\"\r\n)\r\n```\r\n\r\nTechnically Black could implement the \"fill\" algorithm for this case that Prettier also has for JSX.

is an automatic code formatter that has opinions. This is similar to ``gofmt`` in the golang community. I would like to switch pip over to automatically formatting code using black (and enforcing that check in the CI).\r\n\r\nThis has a number of benefits, the primary one being that it mostly eliminates the need for human beings to worry about formatting at all. There are still a couple of edge cases where a human might have to worry, but generally it just works.\r\n\r\nThis also means that for contributors sending PRs, they don't have to worry about wether a human is going to \"nitpick\" their PR formatting or not. A machine will do it and if the machine tells them they are wrong, all they have to do is run ``tox -e format`` and it will fix it for them.\r\n\r\nThis is a WIP because I'm hitting an issue with combining black and isort (which is supposed to work, but not sure if It's a black bug or a bug with my settings) and because it currently won't run on Windows. If there are no objections to this, then I'll work with @ambv to get an ``--ignore`` option added to black so that we can drop the Unix specific shenanigans to ignore the ``pip/_vendor`` directory.\r\n\r\nFundamentally though, the idea here is to reduce manual effort and let us focus on important parts of the code, rather than having to sit there and tweak and tweak code formatting to please some tool-- the tool will just do it for us.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pypa/pip/issues/5425/reactions","total_count":4,"+1":3,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":1,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pypa/pip/issues/5425/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"actor":{"login":"zsol","id":66740,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2NzQw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/66740?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsol","html_url":"https://github.com/zsol","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsol/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsol/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsol/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsol/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsol/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsol/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsol/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsol/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsol/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-06-21T16:29:51Z","updated_at":"2018-06-21T16:29:51Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/psf/black/issues/369","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/psf/black","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/psf/black/issues/369/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/psf/black/issues/369/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/psf/black/issues/369/events","html_url":"https://github.com/psf/black/issues/369","id":334558934,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWUzMzQ1NTg5MzQ=","number":369,"title":"Bad
