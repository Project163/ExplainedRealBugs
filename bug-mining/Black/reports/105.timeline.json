It's confusing that the documentation says that \"black[d]\" is a separate package \r\n\r\n> blackd is not packaged alongside Black by default because it has additional dependencies. You will need to execute pip install black[d] to install it.\r\n\r\nbut at the same time, `blackd` executable is available directly after `black` installation, though with broken dependencies.","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/psf/black/issues/comments/686601143/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"east825","id":1007556,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMDc1NTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1007556?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/east825","html_url":"https://github.com/east825","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/east825/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/east825/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/east825/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/east825/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/east825/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/east825/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/east825/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/east825/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/east825/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":3725534219,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MzcyNTUzNDIxOQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/psf/black/issues/events/3725534219","actor":{"login":"JohnVillalovos","id":578155,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3ODE1NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/578155?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JohnVillalovos","html_url":"https://github.com/JohnVillalovos","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JohnVillalovos/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JohnVillalovos/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JohnVillalovos/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JohnVillalovos/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JohnVillalovos/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JohnVillalovos/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JohnVillalovos/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JohnVillalovos/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JohnVillalovos/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-09-03T16:15:37Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":3725534221,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDM3MjU1MzQyMjE=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/psf/black/issues/events/3725534221","actor":{"login":"JohnVillalovos","id":578155,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3ODE1NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/578155?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JohnVillalovos","html_url":"https://github.com/JohnVillalovos","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JohnVillalovos/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JohnVillalovos/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JohnVillalovos/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JohnVillalovos/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JohnVillalovos/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JohnVillalovos/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JohnVillalovos/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JohnVillalovos/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JohnVillalovos/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-09-03T16:15:37Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":7125318815,"node_id":"REFE_lADOB3dpmM4YJQ_uzwAAAAGos7yf","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/psf/black/issues/events/7125318815","actor":{"login":"LarsMichelsen","id":2719629,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3MTk2Mjk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2719629?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/LarsMichelsen","html_url":"https://github.com/LarsMichelsen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LarsMichelsen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LarsMichelsen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LarsMichelsen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LarsMichelsen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LarsMichelsen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LarsMichelsen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LarsMichelsen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LarsMichelsen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LarsMichelsen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"03b658e0265c48355fcbf7f6cd267833d0f4572f","commit_url":"https:/
