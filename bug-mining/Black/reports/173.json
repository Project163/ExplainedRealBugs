(Congrats and Thank You!)\r\n\r\nAn issue which has come up in multiple projects is automatic tests failing because of differences in the installed `black` versions between environments.\r\n\r\nFor example: a project may indicate a particular version of black in a pre-commit configuration in `.pre-commit-config.yaml` (https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/version_control_integration.html) which will re-format the code to that version... but that will not-necessarily be the same version which is invoked by the local developer or the build/deploy service - as black will consult the `pyproject.toml` file instead (https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/pyproject_toml.html).\r\n\r\nThis can create issues on automated tests, because the server environment may be configured to install `19.3b0` while the hook or developer's environment is formatting to `19.10b0`.  This can suggest a developer didn't run `black` or made an error, when the build/deploy system is what requires adjustment.\r\n\r\nA potential solution is to extend the `pyproject.toml` configuration to have an argument which states the required version:\r\n\r\n    [tool.black]\r\n    line-length = 88\r\n    rev = 19.10b0\r\n\r\nIf specified, black would then raise a fatal exception if invoked with a version that does not match. Perhaps a commandline flag is needed to avoid this for certain causes.  Some projects specify a specific version of black for a particular test environment in `tox.ini`, but nothing is global.\r\n\r\nAn alternative might also include migrating the version declaration from the `.pre-commit-config.yaml` into the `pyproject.toml` file, where it seems to be more applicable.  However, I assume the revision was declared in this file for important reasons I do not understand yet.\r\n\r\nTo summarize:\r\n\r\n* pre-config integration is great, but if a contributor doesn't have pre-commit installed, they'll invoke black directly\r\n* if a contributor invokes black directly, they may format the code with a different version than the project uses\r\n* automated systems can pick up a new version of black; by may not pin the version in the tox config for the test. or they use travis.\r\n\r\nhaving a centralized version pin, instead of requiring a version pin for each context, would eliminate many problems.\r\n\r\nThank you.\r\n\r\nsee also: #420\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"JelleZijlstra","id":906600,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkwNjYwMA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/906600?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra","html_url":"https://github.com/JelleZijlstra","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/psf/black/issues/1246/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/psf/black/issues/1246/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
