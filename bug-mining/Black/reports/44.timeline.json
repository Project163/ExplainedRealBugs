lib2to3 turns out to be too limited, I think you could also hack comment support into a regular parser by doing a second pass scanning for comments (they're included in `tokenize` output) and then matching that up with your AST using the line/offset numbers. I think [prettier](https://github.com/prettier) might use this way?\r\n\r\nComment handling is super hard so I sympathize. But I'm really skeptical about whether a real-world formatter can get away with handling comments properly without taking their original spacing into account. For another much simpler example: the way black mangles the vertical spacing around [section break comments](https://github.com/python-trio/trio/blob/aee2676fd5096daf2849db9756242a30e0aa1f30/trio/_socket.py#L345-L347) in [this file](https://github.com/python-trio/trio/blob/master/trio/_socket.py) is pretty annoying. I'm not happy that that file is so complicated that it needs those section breaks, but since I'm reimplementing the huge `socket` module interface I can't really change the file, and those comments help make it more manageable.\r\n\r\n#22 is another tricky comment handling issue -- I hope it's just a minor bug, but I wouldn't be shocked if it turns out to be unfixable while sticking to lib2to3's grammar.","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/psf/black/issues/comments/373557552/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"njsmith","id":609896,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYwOTg5Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/609896?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/njsmith","html_url":"https://github.com/njsmith","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/njsmith/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/njsmith/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/njsmith/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/njsmith/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/njsmith/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/njsmith/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/njsmith/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/njsmith/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/njsmith/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":1524909888,"node_id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDE1MjQ5MDk4ODg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/psf/black/issues/events/1524909888","actor":{"login":"ambv","id":55281,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1Mjgx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55281?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambv","html_url":"https://github.com/ambv","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambv/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambv/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambv/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambv/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambv/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambv/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambv/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambv/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambv/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-03-16T07:14:59Z","label":{"name":"design","color":"0052cc"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":1524909890,"node_id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDE1MjQ5MDk4OTA=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/psf/black/issues/events/1524909890","actor":{"login":"ambv","id":55281,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1Mjgx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55281?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambv","html_url":"https://github.com/ambv","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambv/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambv/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambv/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambv/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambv/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambv/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambv/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambv/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambv/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-03-16T07:14:59Z","label":{"name":"comments","color":"ff00aa"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"actor":{"login":"ambv","id":55281,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1Mjgx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55281?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambv","html_url":"https://github.com/ambv","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambv/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambv/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambv/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambv/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambv/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambv/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambv/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambv/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambv/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-03-16T07:15:53Z","updated_at":"2018-03-16T07:15:53Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/psf/black/issues/32","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/psf/black","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/psf/black/issues/32/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/psf/black/issues/32/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/psf/black/issues/32/events","html_url":"https://github.com/psf/black/issues/32","id":305751296,"node_id":"MDU6SXNz
