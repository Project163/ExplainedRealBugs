Take this file:\r\n```py\r\nclass X:\r\n    async def foo(self):\r\n        msg = \"\"\r\n        for candidate in CANDIDATES:\r\n            msg += (\r\n                \"**{candidate.object_type} {candidate.rev}**\"\r\n                \" - {candidate.description}\\n\"\r\n            )\r\n```\r\n2. Run _Black_ on it with these arguments `--experimental-string-processing`\r\n3. See the reformatted code that exceeds line length limit:\r\n```py\r\nclass X:\r\n    async def foo(self):\r\n        msg = \"\"\r\n        for candidate in CANDIDATES:\r\n            msg += \"**{candidate.object_type} {candidate.rev}** - {candidate.description}\\n\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\n\r\nI expected the code to remain unchanged.\r\n\r\n**Environment (please complete the following information):**\r\n\r\n- Version: main (`cf75673` at the time of testing)\r\n- OS and Python version: Windows 10/Python 3.8.9\r\n\r\n**Does this bug also happen on main?**\r\n\r\nYes.\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\n\r\nI was unable to find another issue that would seem to be the same as this though it's possible I missed something. Just to be sure it's not about the same thing #2284 is, I also tried out the changes from #2292 (since they apparently fix some edge cases that weren't fixed by #2286.\r\nAlso, the original code actually contained f-string but to rule out that it has anything to do with #2293, I changed it to use regular strings which as you can see from the issue description didn't change the end result.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"JelleZijlstra","id":906600,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkwNjYwMA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/906600?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra","html_url":"https://github.com/JelleZijlstra","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JelleZijlstra/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/psf/black/issues/2294/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/psf/black/issues/2294/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
