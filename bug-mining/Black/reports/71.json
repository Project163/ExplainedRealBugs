But that doesn't work on Windows. We need support for `--include=` and `--exclude=` within Black.\r\n\r\nThey hold regular expressions. The former is \"what gets included on recursive searches\", the latter \"what gets dropped on recursive searches\". You can pass multiple `--include` and multiple `--exclude`. Checks for `--exclude` are done first, checks for `--include` later. \r\n\r\n`--include=` would have a default that is now stores in PYTHON_EXTENSIONS (\"\\.pyi?$\" in regex form)\r\n`--exclude=` would have a default that is now stored in BLACKLISTED_DIRECTORIES\r\n\r\nThis functionality is required by https://github.com/pypa/pip/pull/5425.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"ambv","id":55281,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1Mjgx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55281?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambv","html_url":"https://github.com/ambv","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambv/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambv/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambv/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambv/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambv/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambv/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambv/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambv/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambv/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/psf/black/issues/270/reactions","total_count":7,"+1":5,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":2,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/psf/black/issues/270/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
