@kalekseev \r\n\r\nI figured out how to split stdout and stderr into different emacs buffers. It's implemented via a pipe from stderr and actually, there are two processes. Probably Vim has the same possibility.\r\n\r\nI agree with @ambv not to add this flag because it increases maintenance support and open questions for a lot more configuration. If it is possible to solve this without changing `black` itself we should try to do so.\r\n\r\nAs far as I know vim support python as a scripting language. Probably this can help, but it probably depends on vim compilation details. Like against what python version it was compiled?\r\n\r\nRegards,

@proofit404, yes it's not that hard to read the stdout only, my question is more about convenience. Almost all formatters that I worked with have some sort of that option and I think it could improve user experience with black, because you can run `black --help` and see solution for your problem.\r\nOtherwise user should know about stdout/stderr check how it can be integrate with his editor, etc..\r\n\r\nBTW for neoformat I used\r\n\r\n```\r\nlet g:neoformat_python_black = {\r\n

way would be to have that mode be the default, but I'm not fussed about that); because at this point it's no longer a matter of a simple redirection, it requires conditional logic, and not every integration framework is going to make that easy.\r\n\r\nI think black should have a `--quiet` option that avoids all output except in case of failure.\r\n\r\nThe fact is that if we don't do this, we will have a ton of integrations using a naive `2>/dev/null`, because that's the simplest way to get it working without noise in the success case.\r\n\r\nIf we add `-q`, then that suddenly becomes the simplest way to get it working, and we can ensure it does the right thing.","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/psf/black/issues/comments/377551037/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"carljm","id":61586,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYxNTg2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/61586?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/carljm","html_url":"https://github.com/carljm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/carljm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/carljm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/carljm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/carljm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/carljm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/carljm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/carljm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/carljm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/carljm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/psf/black/issues/comments/377553597","html_url":"https://github.com/psf/black/issues/78#issuecomment-377553597","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/psf/black/issues/78","id":377553597,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM3NzU1MzU5Nw==","user":{"login":"kalekseev","id":367259,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2NzI1OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/367259?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kalekseev","html_url":"https://github.com/kalekseev","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kalekseev/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kalekseev/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kalekseev/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kalekseev/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kalekseev/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kalekseev/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kalekseev/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kalekseev/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kalekseev/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-03-30T15:45:51Z","updated_at":"2018-03-30T15:55:39Z","body":"@ambv
