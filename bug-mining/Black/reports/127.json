It can also be a suitable ordinary file. For me, git works fine with the following:\r\n\r\n```sh\r\n$ cat .git\r\ngitdir: /home/jfine/.gitrepos/scratch.git/\r\n```\r\nHowever, black uses the code\r\n```python\r\n        if (directory / \".git\").is_dir():\r\n            return directory\r\n```\r\n(See https://github.com/psf/black/blob/master/black.py#L3600)\r\n\r\nThis problem is particularly important when git worktrees are used. (Because git allows .git to be a suitable ordinary file, I regard it as a bug rather than feature, that black doesn't recognise this.)\r\n\r\nBy they way, there's a great deal I like about black. I've been reading the source, because I want find a configuration file in a similar way.
