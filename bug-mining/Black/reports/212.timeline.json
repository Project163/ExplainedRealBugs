It adds parentheses around implicit string concatenations when it's inside a list, set, or tuple.\r\n\r\n### Implementation notes\r\n\r\nLooking at the order of the transformers [here](https://github.com/psf/black/blob/05b63c4bccbfb292a92d3ec962ce9b8fa4ebcfd5/src/black/linegen.py#L474-L480), we need to \"wrap in parens\" _before_ `string_split` runs. So my solution is to introduce a \"collaboration\" between `StringSplitter` and `StringParenWrapper` where the splitter \"skips\" the split until the wrapper adds the parens (and then the line after the paren is split by `StringSplitter`) in another pass.\r\n\r\nI have also considered an alternative approach, where I tried to add a different \"string paren wrapper\" class, and it runs before `string_split`. Then I found out it requires a different `do_transform` implementation than `StringParenWrapper.do_transform`, since the later assumes it runs _after_ the `delimiter_split` transform. So I stopped researching that route.\r\n\r\n### Checklist - did you ...\r\n\r\n<!-- If any of the following items aren't relevant for your contribution\r\n     please still tick them so we know you've gone through the checklist.\r\n\r\n    All user-facing changes should get an entry.
