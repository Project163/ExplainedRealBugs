Please describe.**\r\n\r\nAs a new user of black, I installed the `black` package from my distribution to try it out. After that, I wanted to integrate it into vim. I set up the plugin, but discovered that the plugin requires building a virtualenv within which to install black. Using a virtualenv is undesirable to me for the following reasons:\r\n* I already have black installed; there should be no need to install it again.\r\n* The virtualenv adds clutter to my `~/.vim` directory.\r\n* I'd prefer to upgrade/manage black via my distribution's package manager.\r\n* In order to use a virtualenv, I would need to install additional python packages for which I have no other immediate use.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\n\r\nI'd prefer the vim plugin to use the system installation of black. Since having a virtualenv is apparently desirable to other people, this should be configurable.\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\n\r\nI've considered using the virtualenv.\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\n\r\nPlease review the PR which I will submit shortly.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nCorey","closed_by":{"login":"cooperlees","id":3005596,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwMDU1OTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3005596?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cooperlees","html_url":"https://github.com/cooperlees","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cooperlees/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cooperlees/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cooperlees/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cooperlees/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cooperlees/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cooperlees/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cooperlees/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cooperlees/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cooperlees/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/psf/black/issues/3308/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/psf/black/issues/3308/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
