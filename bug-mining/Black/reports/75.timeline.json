Can't think of anything off the top of my head besides structural changes:\r\n\r\n- flake8 can't (yet) ignore ranges of lines so that's out\r\n- move these constants to a separate file and use file-wide `# flake8: noqa` (not great, but not awful, though it's a \"bigger\" change than I'd like to do in a formatting-only bugfix patchset)\r\n- Exclude line length check in flake8 entirely (not ideal as I'm not sure what else black currently is intended to skip over, or which it might incidentally skip over; but if I'm otherwise relegating line length checks to black, that is probably paranoia)\r\n- go back to using black 18.4a4 for Paramiko specifically (I don't like inconsistency and my other projects are so far all on
