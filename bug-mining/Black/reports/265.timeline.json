If retries fails it's critical.\r\n```\r\nonly because of the inline comment.\r\n\r\nUnlike @ocehugo (unless this is the missing fourth option 😉) I want my formatter to disregard inline comments. I use inline comments to give extra context information about a line of code without being obtrusive. I want to focus on the code, and only look to the comment if I have a question about the code. I think a separate line comment is much more obtrusive. I barely look at the inline comments unless I have a question about the actual line of code.\r\n\r\nSince there is no inline exclude (https://github.com/psf/black/issues/451) - I would have preferred to use that - I used\r\n```python\r\n# explanation about what the goal of this section of code is doing (maybe should refactor to its own function)\r\n# loop has an `if: break` when there are no more transactions, and updates offset with batch size on each loop\r\nwhile (retries < len(RETRY_BACKOFF)):  \r\n    other code\r\n    # Only error level since we have retries. If retries fails it's critical.\r\n    logger.error(error, exc_info=True)\r\n```\r\nBut I don't like it that I have to be so careful with inline comments for the risk of creating the mess it does. If I wanted separate line comments instead of inline comments, I would use that.\r\n\r\nI also tried using `#fmt: off/on` but I can't get it to work properly around the while statement (and I think it's more obtrusive than the above anyways)\r\n```python\r\n# explanation about what the goal of this section of code is doing (maybe should refactor to its own function)\r\n# fmt: off\r\nwhile (retries < len(RETRY_BACKOFF)):  # loop has an `if: break` when there are no more transactions, and updates offset with batch size on each loop\r\n# fmt: on\r\n    other code\r\n    # fmt: off\r\n    logger.error(error, exc_info=True)  # Only error level since we have retries.

snapshots\r\n\r\nI had to make a small fix to our tuple normalization logic for `del` statements\r\nin the second commit, otherwise the tests were panicking at a changed AST. I\r\nthink the new implementation is closer to the intention described in the nearby\r\ncomment anyway, though.\r\n\r\nThe first commit adds the new Python, settings, and `.expect` files, the next three commits make some small\r\nfixes to help get the tests running, and then the fifth commit accepts all but one of the new snapshots. The last commit includes the new unsupported syntax error for one f-string example, tracked in #20774.\r\n\r\nTest Plan\r\n--\r\n\r\nNewly imported tests. I went through all of the new snapshots and added review comments below.
