Hello! Thanks for submitting a PR. To help make things go a bit more\r\n     smoothly we would appreciate that you go through this template. -->\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n<!-- Good things to put here include: reasoning for the change (please link\r\n     any relevant issues!), any noteworthy (or hacky) choices to be aware of,\r\n     or what the problem resolved here looked like ... we won't mind a ranty\r\n     story :) -->\r\n\r\nPreviously _Black_ produces invalid code because the `# fmt: on` is used on a different block level.\r\n\r\nWhile _Black_ requires `# fmt: off` and `# fmt: on` to be used at the same block level, incorrect usage shouldn't cause crashes.\r\n\r\nThe formatting behavior this PR introduces is, the code below the initial `# fmt: off` block level will be turned off for formatting, when `# fmt: on` is used on a different level or there is no `# fmt: on`. This also matches the current behavior when `# fmt: off` is used at the top-level without a matching `# fmt: on`, it turns off formatting for everything below `# fmt: off`.\r\n\r\n- Fixes #2567\r\n- Fixes #3184\r\n- Fixes #2985\r\n- Fixes #2882\r\n- Fixes #2232\r\n- Fixes #2140\r\n- Fixes #1817\r\n- Fixes #569\r\n\r\n### Checklist - did you ...\r\n\r\n<!-- If any of the following items aren't relevant for your contribution\r\n     please still tick them so we know you've gone through the checklist.\r\n\r\n    All user-facing changes should get an entry. Otherwise, signal to us\r\n    this should get the magical label to silence the CHANGELOG entry check.\r\n    Tests are required for bugfixes and new features. Documentation changes\r\n    are necessary for formatting and most enhancement changes. -->\r\n\r\n- [x] Add a CHANGELOG entry if necessary?\r\n- [x] Add / update tests if necessary?\r\n- [x] Add new / update outdated documentation?\r\n\r\n<!-- Just as a reminder, everyone in all psf/black spaces including PRs\r\n     must follow the PSF Code of Conduct (link below).\r\n\r\n     Finally, once again thanks for your time and effort.
