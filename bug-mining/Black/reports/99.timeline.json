I think we might be able to fix this by allowing pre-existing `#'` and `#%%` to not be normalized with a space. If that helps literate programming, I'm all for it. It's an interesting concept I never found a way to employ in real code to be honest. If you look at `black.py`, I attempt it *a bit* by sorting code in a way where high-level functions are on the top and low-level are on the bottom. Some module-level variables are defined closer to where they are used. And so on. If you have any tips how I could improve this further, let me know in a separate issue.","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/psf/black/issues/comments/424679609/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"ambv","id":55281,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1Mjgx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55281?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambv","html_url":"https://github.com/ambv","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambv/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambv/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambv/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambv/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambv/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambv/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambv/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambv/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambv/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/psf/black/issues/comments/424756333","html_url":"https://github.com/psf/black/issues/532#issuecomment-424756333","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/psf/black/issues/532","id":424756333,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQyNDc1NjMzMw==","user":{"login":"piccolbo","id":905563,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkwNTU2Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/905563?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/piccolbo","html_url":"https://github.com/piccolbo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piccolbo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piccolbo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piccolbo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piccolbo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piccolbo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piccolbo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piccolbo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piccolbo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piccolbo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-09-26T15:20:09Z","updated_at":"2018-09-26T15:20:09Z","body":"Thanks for your comment. I can expand on the use case a bit. If literate programming may be a little outmoded, reproducible reports are all the rage and that's what pweave does, meaning that it will execute the python code and include it in the output together with the text. The 800-pound gorilla is the jupyter notebook but it is based on a binary format that's un-versionable and un-diffable. Pweave uses two simple text formats, one is a markdown with extensions and the other is plain python code with special comments. Here is  a simple example where I took the [test suit](https://github.com/piccolbo/altair_recipes/blob/master/tests/test_autocorrelation.py), added some text and included it straight into the [docs](https://altair-recipes.readthedocs.io/en/latest/examples.html), all refreshed automatically with make test and make docs. Keeps everything nice and current, keeps real eyes on real output for additional QA and is an effort multiplier for a one-man project.","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/psf/black/issues/comments/424756333/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"piccolbo","id":905563,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkwNTU2Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/905563?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/piccolbo","html_url":"https://github.com/piccolbo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piccolbo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piccolbo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piccolbo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piccolbo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piccolbo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piccolbo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piccolbo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piccolbo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piccolbo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":1868948945,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MTg2ODk0ODk0NQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/psf/black/issues/events/1868948945","actor":{"login":"ambv","id":55281,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1Mjgx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55281?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambv","html_url":"https://github.com/ambv","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambv/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambv/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambv/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambv/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambv/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambv/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambv/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambv/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambv/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":"c6c8ef76a4d991cd8a7a3b00a816b6db72ecdf04","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/psf/black/commits/c6c8ef76a4d991cd8a7a3b00a816b6db72ecdf04","created_at":"2018-09-26T16:43:19Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/psf/black/issues/comments/424787583","html_url":"https://github.com/psf/black/issues/532#issuecomment-424787583","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/psf/black/issues/532","id":424787583,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQyNDc4NzU4Mw==","user":{"login":"ambv","id":55281,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1Mjgx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55281?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambv","html_url":"https://github.com/ambv","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambv/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambv/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambv/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambv/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambv/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambv/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambv/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambv/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ambv/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-09-26T16:43:24Z","updated_at":"2018-09-26T16:43:24Z","body":"Thanks

the bug**\r\n\r\nBehaviour of `black` in adding a single space after the `#`in in-line comments is inconsistent when single or double quotes is used within the comments. Please see the MWE.\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\n\r\nFor example, take this code (before black was applied):\r\n\r\n```python\r\n# NOTOK:\r\n# single quote -> double quotes, as expected. But black wouldn't introduce\r\n# a space after the `#` character on the commented-out line.\r\nstring_single = [\r\n    'a',\r\n    'b',\r\n    #'c',\r\n    'd',\r\n]\r\n\r\n# OK:\r\n# Space added after `#` as expected.\r\nstring_double = [\r\n    \"a\",\r\n    \"b\",\r\n    #\"c\",\r\n    \"d\",\r\n]\r\n\r\n# OK:\r\n# Space added after `#` as expected.\r\nints = [\r\n    1,\r\n    2,\r\n    #3,\r\n    4,\r\n]\r\n```\r\n\r\nI ran this on the Black Playground. (22.3.0)\r\n\r\nThe output is like this:\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/30731072/165076611-5c1166b6-25c5-48fa-bc96-b338acef3127.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\n\r\nExpected output for the first NOTOK case is\r\n```python\r\nstring_double = [\r\n    \"a\",\r\n    \"b\",\r\n    # 'c',\r\n    \"d\",\r\n]\r\n```\r\nI don't expect the 3rd line to become `# \"c\"` (double quotes instead of single quotes); I appreciate that black does not wish to modify commented code too much.\r\n\r\nBut I hope the behaviour of adding a single space after `#` can be more consistent.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/psf/black/issues/3036/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/psf/black/issues/3036/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"not_planned"}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
