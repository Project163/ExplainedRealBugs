This can make debugging issues tricky for CI integrations relying on return codes. I wouldn't go so far as to call it a bug, but it was a bit unexpected to me.\r\n\r\n(It also happens without `--check`.)\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\n\r\n```console\r\n$ printf \"def a():\\n    pass\\n\" | black - --check; echo \"return: $?\"\r\ndef a():\r\n    pass\r\nAll done! ✨ 🍰 ✨\r\n1 file left unchanged.\r\nreturn: 0\r\n$ printf \"def a():\\n    pass\\n\" | black - --check --config \"foo\"; echo \"return: $?\"\r\nError: Could not open file foo: Error reading configuration file: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: 'foo'\r\nreturn: 1\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\n\r\n`--check` says:\r\n\r\n> Don't write the files back, just return the status.  Return code 0 means nothing would change.  Return code 1 means some files would be reformatted.  Return code 123 means there was an internal error.\r\n\r\nSo I would expect this case to return an error code other than `1`.\r\n\r\n**Environment (please complete the following information):**\r\n\r\n- Version: `19.10b0`, `master` (both tested)\r\n- OS and Python version: macOS 10.15.3 with Python 3.7.7; and Ubuntu 18.04.4 with Python 3.6.9\r\n\r\n**Does this bug also happen on master?**\r\n\r\nYes (tested via cloning and `pipenv shell`)\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\n\r\nThis can be very awkward to debug in a CI environment if you rely on return codes only.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"zsol","id":66740,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2NzQw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/66740?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsol","html_url":"https://github.com/zsol","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsol/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsol/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsol/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsol/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsol/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsol/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsol/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsol/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsol/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/psf/black/issues/1360/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/psf/black/issues/1360/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
