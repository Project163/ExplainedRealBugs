 * Previously cached child Elements of an Element were not correctly invalidated in `Node#replaceWith(Node)`, which could lead to incorrect results when subsequently calling `Element#children()`. [#2391](https://github.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/2391)
 * Attribute selector values are now compared literally without trimming. Previously, jsoup trimmed whitespace from selector values and from element attribute values, which could cause mismatches with browser behavior (e.g. `[attr=" foo "]`). Now matches align with the CSS specification and browser engines. [#2380](https://github.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/2380)
 * When using the JDK HttpClient, any system default proxy (`ProxySelector.getDefault()`) was ignored. Now, the system proxy is used if a per-request proxy is not set. [#2388](https://github.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/2388), [#2390](https://github.com/jhy/jsoup/pull/2390)
+* A ValidationException could be thrown in the adoption agency algorithm with particularly broken input. Now logged as a parse error. [#2393](https://github.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/2393)
