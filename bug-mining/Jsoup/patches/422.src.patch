 * The HTML pretty-printer would incorrectly trim whitespace when text followed an inline element in a block element. [#2325](https://github.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/2325)
 * Custom tags with hyphens or other non-letter characters in their names now work correctly as Data or RcData tags. Their closing tags are now tokenized properly. [#2332](https://github.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/2332)
 * When cloning an Element, the clone would retain the source's cached child Element list (if any), which could lead to incorrect results when modifying the clone's child elements. [#2334](https://github.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/2334)
+* When parsing HTML with svg:script elements in SVG elements, don't enter the Text insertion mode, but continue to parse as foreign content. Otherwise, misnested HTML could then cause an IndexOutOfBoundsException. [#2374](https://github.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/2374)
