No problem - just write a new `Cleaner` implementation with the changed behavior I thought. Well, not so much: `Safelist` cannot be used in that scenario because all test methods like `#isSafeTag()` and friends (`#isSafeAttribute()`, `#getEnforcedAttributes()`) are `protected` or `default`.\r\n`Cleaner` can access them of course, being in the same package.\r\nWith the Java-9+ module system however, I cannot just create my own class in that same package as it belongs to a different module.\r\nSo, I have to write my own `Safelist`, too. (Or copy the source to some local package.) Which is kind of sad.\r\nCould we make those test methods `public` so that `Safelist` could be used in custom code?","closed_by":{"login":"jhy","id":76934,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc2OTM0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/76934?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy","html_url":"https://github.com/jhy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jhy/jsoup/issues/1780/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jhy/jsoup/issues/1780/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
