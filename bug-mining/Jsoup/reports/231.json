Example code:\r\n```\r\n    private static final String html =\r\n        \"<html>\\n\" +\r\n        \"<head>\\n\" +\r\n        \"    <link href=\\\"css/test.css\\\" rel=\\\"stylesheet\\\">\\n\" +\r\n        \"</head>\\n\" +\r\n        \"<body>\\n\" +\r\n        \"</body>\\n\" +\r\n        \"</html>\";\r\n    public static void main(final String... args) {\r\n        Document document = Jsoup.parse(html);\r\n        document.traverse(new NodeVisitor() {\r\n            @Override\r\n            public void head(Node node, int depth) {\r\n                if (node instanceof Element) {\r\n                    Element element = (Element) node;\r\n                    if (\"link\".equals(element.tagName())) {\r\n                        Element style = element.ownerDocument().createElement(\"style\");\r\n                        element.replaceWith(style);\r\n                    }\r\n                }\r\n            }\r\n\r\n            @Override\r\n            public void tail(Node node, int depth) {}\r\n        });\r\n    }\r\n```\r\nI guess this makes sense. But I feel this could be considered a bug. Perhaps the code should simply move on to the next sibling or the parent. Perhaps it should throw a DontReplaceWhatImUsingException.
