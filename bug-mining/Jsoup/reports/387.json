In some cases this doesn't matter, e.g. if all is expected from `NodeVisitor` is just modification of the DOM tree. For example, assertion in test `canRemoveDuringHead()` only asserts how the tree looks afterwards. However, if `NodeVisitor` acts as accumulator, such duplicate visiting can easily lead to incorrect results.\n\nReproducer in the form of a test case (e.g. for `TraversorTest`):\n\n    @ParameterizedTest\n    @ValueSource(strings = {\"em\", \"b\"})\n    void doesntVisitAgainAfterRemoving(String removeTag) {\n        Document doc = Jsoup.parse(\"<div><em>first</em><b>last</b></div>\");\n        Set<Node> visited = new HashSet<>();\n        NodeTraversor.traverse((node, depth) -> {\n            if (!visited.add(node))\n                fail(String.format(\"node '%s' is being visited for the second time\", node));\n            if (removeTag.equals(node.nodeName()))\n                node.remove();\n        }, doc);\n    }\n","closed_by":{"login":"jhy","id":76934,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc2OTM0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/76934?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy","html_url":"https://github.com/jhy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jhy/jsoup/issues/2355/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jhy/jsoup/issues/2355/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
