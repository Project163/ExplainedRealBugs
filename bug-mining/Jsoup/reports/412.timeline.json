think a good approach for this will be to add the option to supply a tag customizer that is called before vending a tag in `tag#get()` / `tag#valueOf()`. And users can modify as desired.\n\n(Not to be nit-picky but for clarity: jsoup parses [HTML](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/) (aka HTML5) or XML. It doesn't know about parsing anything called xhtml5. So I've edited the report.)\n\nThe previous behavior was incorrect against our goal of following the spec and aligning to current browsers. And in particular could lead to parser differential issues (if jsoup parses differently to how browsers do, that's possibly a path for data / XSS smuggling, depending on how things are configured).\n\nAnd thanks for the thanks :) It's much
