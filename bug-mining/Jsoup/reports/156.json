congratulations to your great library - it's awesome! However we're having an issue that got us in serious trouble. I'll explain our scenario:\n\nWe're running a Search/Replace mechanism on many pages of a CMS. The content of the pages is XHTML. The basic scheme we're doing for each page is\n\n``` java\nString xhtml = page.getBody();\nDocument document = Jsoup.parse(xhtml, \"\", Parser.xmlParser());\n// remove some content from document ...\npage.setBody(document.text());\n```\n\nThe big problem is that there is a lot of content that looks like\n\n``` xml\n<some-node><![CDATA[some.string.content=content]]></some-node>\n```\n\nAs soon as we call Jsoup.parse, the CDATA tag is gone and text() will produce this\n\n``` xml\n<some-node>some.string.content=content></some-node>\n```\n\nWhat we have afterwards is a page with corrupt content.\n\nWe'd be very glad about some help, since we really enjoy using Jsoup otherwise!\n","closed_by":{"login":"jhy","id":76934,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc2OTM0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/76934?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy","html_url":"https://github.com/jhy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jhy/jsoup/issues/406/reactions","total_count":3,"+1":3,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jhy/jsoup/issues/406/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
