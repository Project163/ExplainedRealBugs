using jsoup to parse images that link to emoji images. These images have the actual emoji characters encoded in the alt attributes:\r\n\r\n```\r\n<img alt=\"&#55357;&#56495;\" src=\"https://acme.com/images/emojis/100_percent.png\">\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen I parse the attribute using jsoup, the resulting string is garbage:\r\n\r\n```\r\n    @Test\r\n    void parseImageEmojiAttribute() {\r\n        String html = \"<div><img alt=\\\"&#55357;&#56495;\\\" src=\\\"https://acme.com/images/emojis/100_percent.png\\\"></div>\";\r\n        Document document = Jsoup.parse(html);\r\n        Element img = document.select(\"img\").get(0);\r\n        assertEquals(\"\\uD83D\\uDCAF\", img.attr(\"alt\"));\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\nIs there a configuration setting that I'm missing which could help? Failing that, is there a way that I can get the raw value of the attribute so I can parse it myself? For instance, Apache commons text has a utility which can decode the value:\r\n\r\n```\r\n    @Test\r\n    void parseHtmlEncodedEmoji() {\r\n        String emoji = StringEscapeUtils.unescapeHtml4(\"&#55357;&#56495;\");\r\n        assertEquals(\"\\uD83D\\uDCAF\", emoji);\r\n    }\r\n```","closed_by":{"login":"jhy","id":76934,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc2OTM0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/76934?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy","html_url":"https://github.com/jhy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jhy/jsoup/issues/2074/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jhy/jsoup/issues/2074/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
