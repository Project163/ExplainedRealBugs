Background\r\nI might be wrong but I believe there is a regression of issue #887. Most probably it was not really solved in the first place. Note that in #1556, which was solved with the same PR, the XML document is in version _1.1_. XML _1.1_ does permit escaped characters in the range `[#x1-#x8] | [#xB-#xC] | [#xE-#x1F] `. XML _1.0_ on the other hand, does not permit ASCII control characters like `&#xc;`. An XML parser should raise an error (and most of them actually do) if those characters appear in a document with an XML declaration of version _1.0_. This holds both if the character is included in binary (e.g. `\"\\u000c\"`) or as an escaped sequence (e.g. `\"&#xc;\"`). Furthermore, if I a am not mistaken, [XHTML](https://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1) is _a reformulation of XML version 1.0 [sic]_ and not 1.1. Finally, the [w3c validator](https://validator.w3.org/check) raises an error in all the variants of XHTML if the input includes the escape sequence `&#xc;`.\r\n\r\nIf this is considered out of the scope of jsoup that's fine but developers should know that the output might not be a valid XML document even when `OutputSettings.syntax` is `Syntax.xml`. Another option would be to discard those characters when `Syntax.xml` is used. To be honest it's not clear if `Syntax.xml` refers to XML version 1.0 or 1.1. In the code of [Entities.java](https://github.com/jhy/jsoup/blob/2a4c9decd617e7892fe767a535803b68d2268dca/src/main/java/org/jsoup/nodes/Entities.java#L223) though there is a reference to the spec of XML _1.0_. Maybe the name of the constant should have been `Syntax.xhtml` and not `Syntax.xml`. Nevertheless, if it were to choose between the two versions of XML most probably it is more coherent to go for _1.0_ since jsoup is an (X)HTML parser not an XML one.\r\n\r\nI can help prepare a PR if someone can decide what the expected behaviour should be.\r\n\r\n### Desired behaviour\r\n``` java\r\n\r\n@Test\r\npublic void invalidCharactersDiscardedInXml() {\r\n    String invalid = \"AAA&#xc;BBB\\fCCC\";\r\n    Document doc = Jsoup.parseBodyFragment(invalid);\r\n    OutputSettings settings = new OutputSettings().escapeMode(EscapeMode.xhtml).syntax(Syntax.xml).prettyPrint(false);\r\n    String cleaned = doc.outputSettings(settings).toString();\r\n    Assert.assertFalse(cleaned.contains(\"\\f\"));\r\n    Assert.assertFalse(cleaned.contains(\"&#xc;\"));\r\n    Assert.assertTrue(cleaned.matches(\"AAA\\\\ *BBB\\\\ *CCC\"));\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nA subtle detail in the test above is that if `prettyPrint` is true `&#xc;` will be replaced with a space but other control characters forbidden in XML documents (e.g. `&#xe;`) will not. The underlying problem is not really solved if pretty printing is enabled.\r\n\r\n### Observed behaviour\r\n\r\n``` java\r\n\r\n@Test\r\npublic void invalidCharactersNotDiscardedInXml() {\r\n    String invalid = \"AAA&#xc;BBB\\fCCC\";\r\n    Document doc = Jsoup.parseBodyFragment(invalid);\r\n    OutputSettings settings = new OutputSettings().escapeMode(EscapeMode.xhtml).syntax(Syntax.xml).prettyPrint(false);\r\n    String cleaned = doc.outputSettings(settings).body().html();\r\n    Assert.assertEquals(cleaned, \"AAA&#xc;BBB&#xc;CCC\");\r\n}\r\n```","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jhy/jsoup/issues/1743/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jhy/jsoup/issues/1743/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":12942221921,"node_id":"REFE_lADOAAbAPs414K5KzwAAAAMDaqJh","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jhy/jsoup/issues/events/12942221921","actor":{"login":"winning1120xx","id":6879244,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4NzkyNDQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6879244?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/winning1120xx","html_url":"https://github.com/winning1120xx","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/winning1120xx/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/winning1120xx/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/winning1120xx/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/winning1120xx/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/winning1120xx/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/winning1120xx/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/winning1120xx/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/winning1120xx/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/winning1120xx/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"2a4c9decd617e7892fe767a535803b68d2268dca","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/winning1120xx/jsoup/commits/2a4c9decd617e7892fe767a535803b68d2268dca","created_at":"2024-05-27T08:08:13Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
