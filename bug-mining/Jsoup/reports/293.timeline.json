of this, :matchesOwn(^$) will select it along with everything else that has no text nodes\n\nFurthermore, MatchesOwn.matches() uses Matcher.find() when it seems that Matcher.matches() would be more appropriate.\n\nI think that adding a method like Element.fullText() which MatchesOwn.matches() could call and changing it to use Matcher.matches() would be an easy solution.  Not sure if I am missing any reasons that it was implemented in this

changelog</a>.</em></p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>jsoup changelog</p>\r\n<p>*** Release 1.15.1 [2022-May-15]</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>\r\n<p>Change: removed previously deprecated methods and classes (including org.jsoup.safety.Whitelist; use\r\norg.jsoup.safety.Safelist instead).</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>\r\n<p>Improvement: when converting jsoup Documents to W3C Documents in W3CDom, preserve HTML valid attribute names if the\r\ninput document is using the HTML syntax. (Previously, would always coerce using the more restrictive XML syntax.)\r\n<a href=\"https://github.com/jhy/jsoup/pull/1648\">jhy/jsoup#1648</a></p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>\r\n<p>Improvement: added the :containsWholeText(text) selector, to match against non-normalized Element text. That can be\r\nuseful when elements can only be distinguished by e.g. specific case, or leading whitespace, etc.\r\n<a href=\"https://github.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/1636\">jhy/jsoup#1636</a></p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>\r\n<p>Improvement: added Element#wholeOwnText() to retrieve the original (non-normalized) ownText of an Element. Also\r\nadded the :containsWholeOwnText(text) selector, to match against that. BR elements are now treated as newlines\r\nin the wholeText methods.\r\n<a href=\"https://github.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/1636\">jhy/jsoup#1636</a></p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>\r\n<p>Improvement: added the :matchesWholeText(regex) and :matchesWholeOwnText(regex) selectors, to match against whole\r\n(non-normalized, case sensitive) element text and own text, respectively.\r\n<a href=\"https://github.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/1636\">jhy/jsoup#1636</a></p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>\r\n<p>Improvement: when evaluating an XPath query against a context element, the complete document is now visible to the\r\nquery, vs only the context element's sub-tree. This enables support for queries outside (parent or sibling) the\r\nelement, e.g. ancestor-or-self::*.\r\n<a href=\"https://github.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/1652\">jhy/jsoup#1652</a></p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>\r\n<p>Improvement: allow a maxPaddingWidth on the indent level in OutputSettings when pretty printing. This defaults to\r\n30 to limit the indent level for very deeply nested elements, and may be disabled by setting to -1.\r\n<a href=\"https://github.com/jhy/jsoup/pull/1655\">jhy/jsoup#1655</a></p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>\r\n<p>Improvement: when cloning a Node or an Element, the clone gets a cloned OwnerDocument containing only that clone, so\r\nas to preserve applicable settings, such as the Pretty Print settings.\r\n<a href=\"https://github.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/763\">jhy/jsoup#763</a></p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>\r\n<p>Improvement: added a convenience method Jsoup.parse(File).\r\n<a href=\"https://github.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/1693\">jhy/jsoup#1693</a></p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>\r\n<p>Improvement: in the NodeTraversor, added default implementations for NodeVisitor.tail() and NodeFilter.tail(), so\r\nthat code using only head() methods can be written as lambdas.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>\r\n<p>Improvement: in NodeTraversor, added support for removing nodes via Node.remove() during NodeVisitor.head().\r\n<a href=\"https://github.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/1699\">jhy/jsoup#1699</a></p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>\r\n<p>Improvement: added Node.forEachNode(Consumer<!-- raw HTML omitted -->) and Element.forEach(Consumer&lt;Element) methods, to efficiently\r\ntraverse the DOM with a functional interface.\r\n<a href=\"https://github.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/1700\">jhy/jsoup#1700</a></p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>\r\n<p>Bugfix: boolean attribute names should be case-insensitive, but were not when the parser was configured to preserve</p>\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p>...

changelog</a>.</em></p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>jsoup changelog</p>\r\n<p>*** Release 1.15.1 [2022-May-15]</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>\r\n<p>Change: removed previously deprecated methods and classes (including org.jsoup.safety.Whitelist; use\r\norg.jsoup.safety.Safelist instead).</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>\r\n<p>Improvement: when converting jsoup Documents to W3C Documents in W3CDom, preserve HTML valid attribute names if the\r\ninput document is using the HTML syntax. (Previously, would always coerce using the more restrictive XML syntax.)\r\n<a href=\"https://github.com/jhy/jsoup/pull/1648\">jhy/jsoup#1648</a></p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>\r\n<p>Improvement: added the :containsWholeText(text) selector, to match against non-normalized Element text. That can be\r\nuseful when elements can only be distinguished by e.g. specific case, or leading whitespace, etc.\r\n<a href=\"https://github.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/1636\">jhy/jsoup#1636</a></p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>\r\n<p>Improvement: added Element#wholeOwnText() to retrieve the original (non-normalized) ownText of an Element. Also\r\nadded the :containsWholeOwnText(text) selector, to match against that. BR elements are now treated as newlines\r\nin the wholeText methods.\r\n<a href=\"https://github.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/1636\">jhy/jsoup#1636</a></p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>\r\n<p>Improvement: added the :matchesWholeText(regex) and :matchesWholeOwnText(regex) selectors, to match against whole\r\n(non-normalized, case sensitive) element text and own text, respectively.\r\n<a href=\"https://github.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/1636\">jhy/jsoup#1636</a></p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>\r\n<p>Improvement: when evaluating an XPath query against a context element, the complete document is now visible to the\r\nquery, vs only the context element's sub-tree. This enables support for queries outside (parent or sibling) the\r\nelement, e.g. ancestor-or-self::*.\r\n<a href=\"https://github.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/1652\">jhy/jsoup#1652</a></p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>\r\n<p>Improvement: allow a maxPaddingWidth on the indent level in OutputSettings when pretty printing. This defaults to\r\n30 to limit the indent level for very deeply nested elements, and may be disabled by setting to -1.\r\n<a href=\"https://github.com/jhy/jsoup/pull/1655\">jhy/jsoup#1655</a></p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>\r\n<p>Improvement: when cloning a Node or an Element, the clone gets a cloned OwnerDocument containing only that clone, so\r\nas to preserve applicable settings, such as the Pretty Print settings.\r\n<a href=\"https://github.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/763\">jhy/jsoup#763</a></p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>\r\n<p>Improvement: added a convenience method Jsoup.parse(File).\r\n<a href=\"https://github.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/1693\">jhy/jsoup#1693</a></p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>\r\n<p>Improvement: in the NodeTraversor, added default implementations for NodeVisitor.tail() and NodeFilter.tail(), so\r\nthat code using only head() methods can be written as lambdas.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>\r\n<p>Improvement: in NodeTraversor, added support for removing nodes via Node.remove() during NodeVisitor.head().\r\n<a href=\"https://github.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/1699\">jhy/jsoup#1699</a></p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>\r\n<p>Improvement: added Node.forEachNode(Consumer<!-- raw HTML omitted -->) and Element.forEach(Consumer&lt;Element) methods, to efficiently\r\ntraverse the DOM with a functional interface.\r\n<a href=\"https://github.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/1700\">jhy/jsoup#1700</a></p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>\r\n<p>Bugfix: boolean attribute names should be case-insensitive, but were not when the parser was configured to preserve</p>\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p>...
