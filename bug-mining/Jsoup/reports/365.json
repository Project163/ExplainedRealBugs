uploaded an `example.txt` file that contains the html example. Unfortunately I couldn't get the example to be any smaller, so I apologise for the largeish html example.\n\nWhen rendering the original html file in a HTML renderer you get:\n\n```\nTEXT 1\n\nDKLASJD:  DASDSA ABT  31321 MT /  LSMGO  ABT dsada MT\nTEXT 2\nTEXT 3\n```\n\nOnce you parse the HTML with `Jsoup.parse(html)` and render the new html with a renderer once again you get:\n\n```\nTEXT 1\n\nTEXT 3\nDKLASJD:  DASDSA ABT  31321 MT /  LSMGO  ABT dsada MT\nTEXT 2\n```\n\nNotice how the text has been re-ordered. One thing that may help in investigation is that when you remove all of the inline style attributes, this issue no longer occurs and the text is in the correct order after parsing with `Jsoup.parse()`.\n\nIs this expected behaviour?\n\n[example.txt](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/18574732/example.txt)","closed_by":{"login":"jhy","id":76934,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc2OTM0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/76934?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy","html_url":"https://github.com/jhy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jhy/jsoup/issues/2267/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jhy/jsoup/issues/2267/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
