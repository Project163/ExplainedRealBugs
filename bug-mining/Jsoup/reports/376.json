have been using the Cleaner since v1.16.1 to sanitize SVG by removing script.\nAfter upgrading from v1.19.1 to v1.20.1, the behavior has changed and the text of the script is no longer removed.\n\nA simplified example would be:\n```java\nString dirtyString = \"<svg><script>alert(\\\"test\\\")</script></svg>\";\nDocument dirty = Parser.parse(dirtyString, \"\");\nSafelist safelist = new Safelist().addTags(\"svg\");\nCleaner cleaner = new Cleaner(safelist);\nDocument clean = cleaner.clean(dirty);\nDocument.OutputSettings outputSettings = new Document.OutputSettings().syntax(Document.OutputSettings.Syntax.xml);\nString cleanString = clean.outputSettings(outputSettings).body().html();\n```\nWith all versions from v1.16.1 through v1.19.1, this results in `<svg></svg>` with all the script removed.\nBut with v1.20.1, it now results in `<svg>alert(\"test\")</svg>`.","closed_by":{"login":"jhy","id":76934,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc2OTM0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/76934?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy","html_url":"https://github.com/jhy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jhy/jsoup/issues/2320/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jhy/jsoup/issues/2320/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
