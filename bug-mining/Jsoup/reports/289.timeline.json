looks like changes to `encodeUrl` in 1.15.4 are causing URL double-encoding when redirected.\r\n\r\nFor example, the following exchange:\r\n\r\n```\r\n>>> GET /apostrophe-'\r\n<<< 302 Moved\r\n    Location: /apostrophe-%27\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn 1.15.3, this works, and the new path is followed correctly.  In 1.15.4, the redirect URL ends up being double-encoded to `/apostrophe-%2527` instead.  Which then leads to errors like 404s.\r\n\r\nIt seems to be this change:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/jhy/jsoup/compare/jsoup-1.15.3...jsoup-1.15.4#diff-50cf357d24b529d8ec8ffd200e666d29cb8286c71733da1a27c9b32d1204d676\r\n\r\nWhile tracking this down, I also noticed that the redirect handling code in `HttpConnection$Response#execute(HttpConnection.Request, Response)` also makes a call to `encodeUrl`:\r\n\r\n```java\r\nString location = res.header(LOCATION);\r\n// ...\r\nURL redir = StringUtil.resolve(req.url(), location);\r\nreq.url(encodeUrl(redir));\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis implies that any redirect which sends an already-encoded URL will get double-encoded.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jhy/jsoup/issues/1928/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jhy/jsoup/issues/1928/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"actor":{"login":"michaelarnauts","id":1193779,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExOTM3Nzk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1193779?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/michaelarnauts","html_url":"https://github.com/michaelarnauts","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michaelarnauts/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michaelarnauts/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michaelarnauts/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michaelarnauts/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michaelarnauts/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michaelarnauts/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michaelarnauts/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michaelarnauts/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michaelarnauts/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-05-08T08:15:15Z","updated_at":"2023-05-08T08:15:15Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jhy/jsoup/issues/1952","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jhy/jsoup","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jhy/jsoup/issues/1952/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jhy/jsoup/issues/1952/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jhy/jsoup/issues/1952/events","html_url":"https://github.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/1952","id":1699764934,"node_id":"I_kwDOAAbAPs5lUFrG","number":1952,"title":"JSoup
