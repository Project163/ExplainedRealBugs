Carlos,\n\nThanks for the report.\n\nThe underlying issue here was an outcome of how `Element#children()` is implemented. It creates a cached filtered view Element objects from the element's node list. I recently changed the implementation to use weak references, and stored in the internal data of the attributes (vs a field in the Element).\n\nAs your benchmark has multiple threads accessing the same object concurrently, under GC pressure we were going through the cache regeneration process, but then the concurrent writes to the Attributes object caused these exceptions.\n\nAs the method looks like a plain read, I have added a synchronized section so that it works atomically.\n\nI reexecuted the benchmark and it works for me. It would be great if you can validate it too -- do a `mvn install` on jsoup and then use `<version>1.21.2-SNAPSHOT</version>`.\n\nCheers,\nJonathan\n\n```plaintext\nBenchmark
