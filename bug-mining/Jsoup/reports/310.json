there's no practical use in replacing an element with itself, but robustness is in the edge cases.\r\n\r\nTake the document: \r\n```\r\nbody\r\n| h1\r\n| div\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf we were to replace the h1 with itself via `h1.replaceWith(h1)`, it's next sibling, in this case the div, would be deleted and the h1 would remain - but without a reference to it's parent.\r\n\r\nIn this state, the node traverser fails when rendering the tostring().\r\n\r\nMinimal reproducable :\r\n\r\n```Kotlin\r\n        val doc = Document(\"\")\r\n\r\n        val targetElement = Element(\"h1\")\r\n        doc.body().appendChild(targetElement)\r\n\r\n        // During the replace, the target is removed from the children.\r\n        // 'Ensure child list' within the replace operation is\r\n        // different if there is no children, so we must add another child.\r\n        //\r\n        // Also, there must be children *after* the target element, else\r\n        // there will be an index out of bounds during the replace operation.\r\n        doc.body().appendChild(Element(\"div\"))\r\n\r\n        targetElement.replaceWith(targetElement)\r\n\r\n        // The document can no longer be rendered to string.\r\n        assertDoesNotThrow {\r\n            println(doc)\r\n        }\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis can be solved with a simple equality check.\r\n\r\nSelf assigned, pr
