However, when configuring a custom element as `Tag.Data`, the parser fails to detect the correct closing of the element, resulting in malformed HTML output.\n\nThis issue affects both the **HTML parser** (`Parser.htmlParser()`) and the **XML parser** (`Parser.xmlParser()`), which behave similarly and incorrectly in this context.\n\n#### **Expected Behavior:**\n\nThe input HTML or XML should be preserved as-is, treating the content of custom elements defined as `Tag.Data` as raw data (similar to `<script>` or `<style>`), and not parsing it as nested HTML/XML.\n\n#### **Actual Behavior:**\n\nThe parser misinterprets the contents of the `custom-style` element, incorrectly closing the tag and generating an invalid document structure.\n\n#### **Reproducible Example:**\n\n```java\n@Test\nvoid testHtmlCustomElementsAsData() {\n\n  var tags = TagSet.Html();\n  tags.valueOf(\"custom-style\", Parser.NamespaceHtml)\n      .set(Tag.Data);\n\n  var html = \"\"\"\n      <html>\n       <head>\n        <style> a > p {color: #0000; } </style>\n       </head>\n       <body>\n        <custom-style> a > p {color: #0000; } </custom-style>\n       </body>\n      </html>\"\"\";\n\n  var doc = Parser.htmlParser().tagSet(tags).parseInput(html, \"http://example.com\");\n  assertThat(doc.html()).isEqualToNormalizingNewlines(html);\n}\n```\n\n#### **Actual Output:**\n\n```html\n<html>\n <head>\n  <style> a > p {color: #0000; } </style>\n </head>\n <body>\n  <custom-style> a > p {color: #0000; } </custom-style>\n </body>\n</html></custom-style>\n </body>\n</html>\n```\n\nThe same output pattern is observed when using `Parser.xmlParser()` with a corresponding `TagSet` configuration.\n\n#### **Reproduction Repository:**\n\nYou can find a minimal test project reproducing the issue here:\n🔗 [https://github.com/sparra-inmoba/jsoup-tagset-broken](https://github.com/sparra-inmoba/jsoup-tagset-broken)\n","closed_by":{"login":"jhy","id":76934,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc2OTM0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/76934?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy","html_url":"https://github.com/jhy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jhy/jsoup/issues/2332/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jhy/jsoup/issues/2332/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
