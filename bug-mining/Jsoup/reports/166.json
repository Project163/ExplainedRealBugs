I had a look at the code and came across this section in ConstrainableInputStream:\r\n```\r\n    public int read(byte[] b, int off, int len) throws IOException {\r\n        if (expired())\r\n            throw new SocketTimeoutException(\"Read timeout\");\r\n    ...\r\n\r\n    private boolean expired() {\r\n        if (timeout == -1)\r\n            return false;\r\n    ...\r\n```\r\nThis code effectively treats a timeout of -1 as infinite timeout and was introduced by https://github.com/jhy/jsoup/commit/a63fcab33707b7b466fbbf4ce4e7e63d787ba23e and contains the bug.\r\nHowever, the documentation for timeout states:\r\n`A timeout of zero is treated as an infinite timeout.`\r\nWhen trying to set the timeout to -1, jsoup throws an IllegalArgumentException:\r\n```\r\nException in thread \"main\" java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: Timeout milliseconds must be 0 (infinite) or greater\r\n    at org.jsoup.helper.Validate.isTrue(Validate.java:45)\r\n    at org.jsoup.helper.HttpConnection$Request.timeout(HttpConnection.java:581)\r\n    at org.jsoup.helper.HttpConnection$Request.timeout(HttpConnection.java:537)\r\n    at org.jsoup.helper.HttpConnection.timeout(HttpConnection.java:156)\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Solution\r\nChange ContrainableInputStream#expired to check for 0 instead of -1.\r\nWhile -1 is very commonly used for infinite timeouts, allowing a timeout of 0 would not have much use as it could never succeed.\r\n\r\nGreetings","closed_by":{"login":"jhy","id":76934,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc2OTM0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/76934?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy","html_url":"https://github.com/jhy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jhy/jsoup/issues/968/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jhy/jsoup/issues/968/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
