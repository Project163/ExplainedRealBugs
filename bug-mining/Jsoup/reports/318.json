Jsoup formats the content inside a `<pre>` tag, resulting in a non-equivalent rendering.\r\nGiven the following HTML:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<!DOCTYPE html>\r\n<html lang=\"en\">\r\n<head><title>Test</title></head>\r\n<body>\r\n    <div>\r\n        <pre><span><b><u><span>TEST</span></u></b></span></pre>\r\n    </div>\r\n</body>\r\n</html>\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd running the following Java code\r\n\r\n```java\r\nfinal String html =\r\n        \"<!DOCTYPE html>\\n\"\r\n        + \"<html lang=\\\"en\\\">\\n\"\r\n        + \"<head><title>Test</title></head>\\n\"\r\n
