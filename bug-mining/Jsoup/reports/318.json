reported in #1933:\r\n\r\n---\r\nHere's my PR on the Rascal project. It works! But... I have a missing Range on the attributes on the top node. \r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/usethesource/rascal/pull/1893\r\n\r\nFor testing purposes I was parsing the pom.xml file of the rascal project itself:\r\n\r\n```\r\n<project xmlns=\"http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0\" xmlns:xsi=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\" xsi:schemaLocation=\"http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0 http://maven.apache.org/xsd/maven-4.0.0.xsd\">\r\n    <modelVersion>4.0.0</modelVersion>\r\n\r\n    <groupId>org.rascalmpl</groupId>\r\n    <artifactId>rascal</artifactId>\r\n    <version>0.35.0-RC2-SNAPSHOT</version>\r\n    <packaging>jar</packaging>\r\n  ... SNIP!\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe `project` node has an `xsi:schemaLocation` attribute.\r\n\r\nHere's some output of the `readXML` function that will print the filename only if the attribute sources ranges are `-1`:\r\n```\r\nrascal>import IO;\r\nok\r\nrascal>import lang::xml::IO;\r\nok\r\nrascal>iprintln(readXML(|cwd:///pom.xml|, trackOrigins=true), lineLimit=-1)\r\n\"#document\"(\r\n  \"project\"(\r\n    \"modelversion\"(\r\n      \"4.0.0\",\r\n      src=|cwd:///pom.xml|(209,14,<2,4>,<2,18>)),\r\n    \"groupid\"(\r\n      \"org.rascalmpl\",\r\n      src=|cwd:///pom.xml|(249,9,<4,4>,<4,13>)),\r\n    \"artifactid\"(\r\n      \"rascal\",\r\n      src=|cwd:///pom.xml|(286,12,<5,4>,<5,16>)),\r\n    \"version\"(\r\n      \"0.35.0-RC2-SNAPSHOT\",\r\n      src=|cwd:///pom.xml|(322,9,<6,4>,<6,13>)),\r\n    \"packaging\"(\r\n      \"jar\",\r\n      src=|cwd:///pom.xml|(365,11,<7,4>,<7,15>)),\r\n    \"scm\"(\r\n      \"developerconnection\"(\r\n        \"scm:git:ssh://git@github.com/usethesource/rascal.git\",\r\n        src=|cwd:///pom.xml|(411,21,<10,8>,<10,29>)),\r\n      \"tag\"(\r\n        \"SNAPSHOT\",\r\n        src=|cwd:///pom.xml|(515,5,<11,8>,<11,13>)),\r\n      src=|cwd:///pom.xml|(397,5,<9,4>,<9,9>)),\r\n    \"repositories\"(\r\n      ...

I tracked this with the Java debugger. Is this supposed to happen? Or is the top-node somehow different?\r\n\r\n_Originally posted by @jurgenvinju in https://github.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/1933#issuecomment-1827922873_\r\n            ","closed_by":{"login":"jhy","id":76934,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc2OTM0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/76934?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy","html_url":"https://github.com/jhy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jhy/jsoup/issues/2067/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jhy/jsoup/issues/2067/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
