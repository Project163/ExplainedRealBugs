There's some code in the tokeniser that tries to quickly skip ahead as many characters as possible to find a closing data tag. The positive case (where there was a closing tag) was optimised, but the negative case (no tag) had a bug in the implementation, so it was both falling back to a slow case-insensitive scan and continually re-trying the skip ahead, which made it perform very badly.\n\nI've fixed that now and both cases perform very well.\n","author_association":"OWNER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jhy/jsoup/issues/comments/685575/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"jhy","id":76934,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc2OTM0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/76934?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy","html_url":"https://github.com/jhy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jhy/jsoup/issues/comments/685585","html_url":"https://github.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/67#issuecomment-685585","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jhy/jsoup/issues/67","id":685585,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY4NTU4NQ==","user":{"login":"mattsheppard","id":12991,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyOTkx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12991?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattsheppard","html_url":"https://github.com/mattsheppard","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattsheppard/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattsheppard/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattsheppard/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattsheppard/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattsheppard/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattsheppard/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattsheppard/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattsheppard/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattsheppard/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2011-01-18T04:25:43Z","updated_at":"2011-01-18T04:25:43Z","body":"Great -
