I was wrong, this was a new feature to support the html5 spec.\n\nThe more I think about it though, I'm yearning for the old days where messy self-closing tags that were not html5 compliant were closed.\n\n@wiedsche [notes](https://github.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/2329#issuecomment-2898011582) that the new behavior in 1.20.1 can lead to some concerning behavior.\n\nIs there any way to offer a switch for legacy behavior? Aside from html5 compliance, was there anything wrong with the behavior in 1.19.1 and before?\n\nAs an open source maintainer, I say from the bottom of my heart, @jhy , that I'm super grateful for all of your work on jsoup. It is a gem!
