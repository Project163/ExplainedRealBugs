wanted to update jsoup to the latest version in our service but I came across this [issue](https://github.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/2143). Unfortunately, for our service and use cases it means a breaking change. I don't want to go into details but we basically have some memory which returns similarity of stored strings with the new ones. With this change we will no longer get expected 100% matching when the same document is uploaded into our system again because attributes are normalized in a different way, i.e. replaced with underscore instead of stripping.\r\n\r\nWould it be possible to make this customizable by a client to decide what should happen with illegal characters in an attribute name?\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nTomáš","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jhy/jsoup/issues/2216/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jhy/jsoup/issues/2216/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
