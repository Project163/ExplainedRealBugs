However if the document is being parsed as XML (i.e. using the [XML syntax](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/xhtml.html#the-xhtml-syntax), i.e. \"XHTML\") then yes there are certain rules about namespaces being declared.\r\n\r\nBut I am not referring to the [XML syntax](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/xhtml.html#the-xhtml-syntax).

first description of the bug was incorrect as to the behavior, because I was inadvertently testing on the wrong element. However there is a small bug in attribute processing related to namespaces. I'll leave some of the background information here for those new to (X)HTML namespaces, though._\r\n\r\nThe [description page](https://jsoup.org/) for jsoup says:\r\n\r\n> jsoup implements the [WHATWG HTML5](https://whatwg.org/html) specification, and parses HTML to the same DOM as modern browsers do.\r\n\r\nThe [WHATWG HTML5 Specification § 2.1.3 XML compatibility](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/infrastructure.html#xml) says:\r\n\r\n> Except where otherwise stated, all elements defined or mentioned in this specification are in the [HTML namespace](https://infra.spec.whatwg.org/#html-namespace) (\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\"), and all attributes defined or mentioned in this specification have no namespace.\r\n\r\nLet me explain a little about what the WHATWG specification means here, for those who are not very familiar with XML and (X)HTML namespaces. The WHATWG is not saying that attributes should not be processed in a namespace-aware manner. Rather it means that if an attribute has no prefix, it doesn't inherit the currently defined namespace as elements do; instead, the namespace is set to `null`. And if an attribute _does_ have a prefix, then it does get a namespace; an example from the spec is `xlink:href`.\r\n\r\nIn either case, whether the attribute has a namespace defined or not, the attribute must be given a \"local name\". The spec doesn't say it in this paragraph, but throughout the specification it discuses matching the \"local name\" of attributes. What I have described has been [standard namespace processing for well over 20 years](https://www.w3.org/TR/1999/REC-xml-names-19990114/)! A non-namespace-aware (X)HTML processor will only set the \"node name\" and \"node value\" of a node (including `Attr`), but a namespace-aware processor will also set its \"namespace URI\" and \"local name\".\r\n\r\nIn addition the DOM provides two sets of methods: those that are not namespace aware, and those that are. The methods that are namespace aware usually have `…NS()` on the end, and take a namespace parameter.\r\n\r\nThis code in `W3CDom.W3CBuilder` creates attributes from the jsoup node tree:\r\n\r\n```java\r\nprivate void copyAttributes(org.jsoup.nodes.Node source, Element el) {\r\n  for (Attribute attribute : source.attributes()) {\r\n    String key = Attribute.getValidKey(attribute.getKey(), syntax);\r\n    if (key != null) { // null if couldn't be coerced to validity\r\n      el.setAttribute(key, attribute.getValue());\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis code assumes that `W3CDom` is not namespace aware, so it is using `Element.setAttribute(…)`. But if this `W3CDom` instance is namespace aware, it should be using [`Element.setAttributeNS(…)`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/setAttributeNS). In fact there is a `namespaceAware` flag in `W3CDom.W3CBuilder`, so the code should look like this:\r\n\r\n```java\r\nprivate void copyAttributes(org.jsoup.nodes.Node source, Element el) {\r\n  for (Attribute attribute : source.attributes()) {\r\n    String key = Attribute.getValidKey(attribute.getKey(), syntax);\r\n    if (key != null) { // null if couldn't be coerced to validity\r\n      if(namespaceAware) {  // partial fix for #1839\r\n        el.setAttributeNS(null, key, attribute.getValue());  // partial fix for #1839\r\n      } else {\r\n        el.setAttribute(key, attribute.getValue());\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe existing code works, however, with the current XML implementation. You seem to be getting lucky here, because apparently `el.setAttribute(key, attribute.getValue())` \"does the right thing\" and sets the local name to that given, and sets the namespace URI to `null`. You are doing something similar (although in the opposite way) when you create create elements using `doc.createElementNS(namespace, tagName)`. Presumably if the factory isn't namespace aware, it just \"does the right thing\" when you assign a namespace. But I don't know if this behavior is actually required by the API spec or not; it may be dependent on the XML implementation the JVM happens to be using. Personally I would check the flag and use the correct namespace-aware or non-namespace-aware API each time, both for elements and for attributes.\r\n\r\nBut the bigger problem (which admittedly probably only affects less than 0.1% of documents in the wild) is that the code for converting attributes to the DOM completely ignores any indicated namespace. Attributes _can_ have namespaces too, if they have a prefix (e.g. the `xlink:href` attribute I mentioned in the description). So for a full fix, you need to be doing a similar check for a prefix as you do with elements, using the `namespacesStack` (because attributes use the same namespace inheritance algorithm for explicit namespace declarations), with one change: if an attribute does not indicate a namespace (i.e. it has no prefix), it does _not_ use the currently defined default namespace, but instead gets a `null` namespace.\r\n\r\n_As I mention at the beginning of this description, I originally filed this bug thinking that namespace-aware attributes were broken altogether, but I had been testing on the wrong node. Nevertheless there is a minor bug here that would surface if anyone were to ever try to use an attribute from a non-HTML namespace._","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jhy/jsoup/issues/1839/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jhy/jsoup/issues/1839/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"not_planned"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jhy/jsoup/issues/comments/1264151371","html_url":"https://github.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/1837#issuecomment-1264151371","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jhy/jsoup/issues/1837","id":1264151371,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAAbAPs5LWWtL","user":{"login":"garretwilson","id":627125,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYyNzEyNQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/627125?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/garretwilson","html_url":"https://github.com/garretwilson","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/garretwilson/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/garretwilson/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/garretwilson/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/garretwilson/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/garretwilson/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/garretwilson/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/garretwilson/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/garretwilson/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/garretwilson/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-10-01T00:24:00Z","updated_at":"2022-10-01T00:24:00Z","body":"You can assign me to this ticket.

This is used in a lot of the tests to convert DOM to a string. Now that HTML documents default to the correct namespace after my changes, the returned strings have `xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\"` on the `<html>` element—not because the DOM has that, but because `W3CDom.asString()` is using a `Transformer` which only thinks in terms of XML, and _adds_ the namespace declaration.\r\n\r\nWe can leave it like that or play tricks to get rid of it, but it depends on the purpose and usage of `W3CDom.asString()`. Is it just used for testing? Or is it part of the jsoup API for turning DOM into a string? Presumably once it's in DOM form, developers already have their preferred ways for serialization; jsoup is about parsing, not pretty-printing, after all. In this view, `W3CDom.asString()` is more for testing that the DOM is correct, in which case we can simply update the unit tests to expect the `xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\"`.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, is `W3CDom.asString()` meant to provide a round-trip string representation of the original \"tidied\" HTML? If that is the case, we would want to remove the `xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\"` from the output, unless the user explicitly specified `W3CDom.OutputXml()`. This is not trivial, because as mentioned jsoup is using a `Transformer`, which is a Java feature from eons ago, before HTML5, and only thinks in terms of XML.

The workaround is a bit of a kludge; see [Java XSLT transformer with default namepace without xmlns](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/73919306/java-xslt-transformer-with-default-namepace-without-xmlns) for more discussion. (Ideally we would improve the serializer to output clean HTML5 to begin with, even now that the default namespace has been fixed.) But it's not a mysterious kludge; it is simple and low risk, with unit tests provided.\r\n\r\nThe only serialization change that should affect existing code (I don't know if anybody even called `W3CDom.asString()`, outside the unit tests) is that if someone called it explicitly using `W3CDom.OutputXml()`, then they will now get a string including the `xmlns=\\\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\\\"`, because XML requires the namespace declaration and the document now has that default

am in the process of converting a Thymeleaf 2.1 installation to 3.0 that has a substantial number of existing templates as XML files that contain HTML5 markup.\r\n\r\nXML is used as the template format since it is trivial to author, parse and detect errors such as missing end tags, etc both during editing, development and via CI, using existing tools. Templates have standard HTML5 doctype declarations and \".xml\" file name extensions.\r\n\r\nHTML5 is the desired output format because it is the only sane choice. The rendered output is sent as `text/html`.\r\n\r\nThis seemed to work better with Thymeleaf 2.1 since I could just set the format to be HTML5, however this does not work with 3.0 - an XML declaration is output and this breaks rendering in browsers.\r\n\r\nThus it would be useful to decouple the input and output formats. Thymeleaf could (should?) detect that the template format specifies HTML5 content and do the right thing with the output.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/thymeleaf/thymeleaf/issues/777/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/thymeleaf/thymeleaf/issues/777/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
