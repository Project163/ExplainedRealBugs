You haven't disclosed that). Or something akin.\n\nTo get to the bottom of it, my suggestion would be to write some debug code that traces the specific order of the DOM for both jsoup and browser. Add IDs to each element so we can see which one is which. Then traverse the doc and serialize the tag + ID. For the browser you can do this in JS.
