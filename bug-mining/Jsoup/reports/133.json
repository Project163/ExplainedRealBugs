use JSoup version 1.10.2 and noticed an unexpected case sensitivity for a CSS class selector. I tried to parse the following HTML document with capitalized class attributes:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC '-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional//EN' 'http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/loose.dtd'>\r\n<HTML>\r\n  <HEAD>\r\n    <FORM Method='POST' name='Form' Action='Action'>\r\n      <TABLE Class='Lst'>\r\n        <TR Class='Lst'>\r\n          <TH Class='Lst'>Header 1</TH>\r\n          <TH Class='Lst'>Header 2</TH>\r\n          <TH Class='Lst'>Header 3</TH>\r\n        </TR>\r\n        <TR Class='Lst1'>\r\n          <TD Class='Lst'>Cell 1</TD>\r\n          <TD Class='Lst'>Cell 2</TD>\r\n          <TD Class='Lst'>Cell 3</TD>\r\n        </TR>\r\n      </TABLE>\r\n    </FORM>\r\n  </BODY>\r\n</HTML>\r\n```\r\n\r\nI wanted to select the table using the selector _\"html > body > form table.Lst\"_ because I expected it to choose the table with the class attribute \"Lst\", but that did not work. The selector _\"html > body > form table[class=Lst]\"_ works. Is this a bug?\r\n\r\nHere is the parser code:\r\n\r\n```java\r\ntry {\r\n  final String htmlStr = \"<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC '-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional//EN' 'http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/loose.dtd'>\\n\"\r\n      + \"<HTML>\\n\"\r\n      + \"  <HEAD>\\n\"\r\n      + \"    <FORM Method='POST' name='Form' Action='Action'>\\n\"\r\n      + \"      <TABLE Class='Lst'>\\n\"\r\n      + \"        <TR Class='Lst'>\\n\"\r\n      + \"          <TH Class='Lst'>Header 1</TH>\\n\"\r\n      + \"          <TH Class='Lst'>Header 2</TH>\\n\"\r\n      + \"          <TH Class='Lst'>Header 3</TH>\\n\"\r\n      + \"        </TR>\\n\"\r\n      + \"        <TR Class='Lst1'>\\n\"\r\n      + \"          <TD Class='Lst'>Cell 1</TD>\\n\"\r\n      + \"          <TD Class='Lst'>Cell 2</TD>\\n\"\r\n      + \"          <TD Class='Lst'>Cell 3</TD>\\n\"\r\n      + \"        </TR>\\n\"\r\n      + \"      </TABLE>\\n\"\r\n      + \"    </FORM>\\n\"\r\n      + \"  </BODY>\\n\"\r\n      + \"</HTML>\";\r\n  final Document htmlDoc = Jsoup.parse(htmlStr,\r\n      \"\");\r\n\r\n  final Element tableNotOk = htmlDoc.select(\"html > body > form table.Lst\")\r\n      .first();\r\n  final Element tableOk = htmlDoc.select(\"html > body > form table[class=Lst]\")\r\n      .first();\r\n\r\n  Logger.getLogger(this.getClass().getName())\r\n      .log(Level.INFO,\r\n          \"tableNotOk found: ''{0}'', tableOk found: ''{1}''\",\r\n          new Object[]{(tableNotOk != null), (tableOk != null)});\r\n\r\n} catch (UnsupportedCharsetException | ParseException | Selector.SelectorParseException ex) {\r\n  Logger.getLogger(this.getClass().getName())\r\n      .log(Level.SEVERE,\r\n          null,\r\n          ex);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"jhy","id":76934,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc2OTM0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/76934?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy","html_url":"https://github.com/jhy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jhy/jsoup/issues/814/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jhy/jsoup/issues/814/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
