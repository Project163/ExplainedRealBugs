all,\r\n\r\nI've been unable to upgrade to 1.17.1 from 1.16.2\r\n\r\nFrom a check of the source it looks like there's insufficient checking around whether `currentToken` is not-null? Or I'm lacking context on what `currentToken` is.\r\n\r\nI think the issue was introduced here: https://github.com/jhy/jsoup/pull/2056/files\r\n\r\nIf you add this test to `PositionTest.java` it recreates the issue, this is how I parse a document in 1.16.2:\r\n\r\n```java\r\n    // Based on tracksClosingHeadingTags\r\n    @Test void tracksTagsFromDocumentShell() {\r\n        String html = \"<h1>One</h1><h2>Two</h2><h10>Ten</h10>\";\r\n        Document shellDoc = Document.createShell(\"\");\r\n\r\n        // Should not throw a NullPointerException (currently: throws a NullPointerException)\r\n        List<Node> nodes = TrackingHtmlParser.parseFragmentInput(html, shellDoc.body(), shellDoc.baseUri());\r\n\r\n        /// ...
