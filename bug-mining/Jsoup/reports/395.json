StructuralEvaluator class contains a memory leak caused by unbounded ThreadLocal accumulation in thread pool environments.\n\nThe StructuralEvaluator class uses a ThreadLocal field to cache CSS selector matching results:\n\n`ThreadLocal<IdentityHashMap<Node, IdentityHashMap<Node, Boolean>>> threadMemo`\n\n  In thread pool environments (web servers, application servers), this causes:\n  - Memory continuously grows as threads are reused across requests\n  - While entries can be garbage collected when their Node keys become unreachable, the ThreadLocal map itself persists for the thread's lifetime\n  - Each new parsing operation may add new entries to the thread's existing map\n  - Even with some entries being GC'd, the overall memory footprint grows over time as not all entries are cleaned up between parsing operations\n  - The reset() method clears the map but is not automatically called between parsing operations\n  - Can lead to OutOfMemoryError in long-running applications\n\nReproducer - https://gist.github.com/valodzka/06fd163e54d822254e6e5049488286cf\nIf run with 256mb fails with OOM after ~5 iterations.\n\nI created local patched jsoup version that doesn't use threadlocal, only regular map - it can handle any number of iterations.","closed_by":{"login":"jhy","id":76934,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc2OTM0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/76934?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy","html_url":"https://github.com/jhy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jhy/jsoup/issues/2411/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jhy/jsoup/issues/2411/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
