below:\r\n\r\n```\r\nfun parseArticleP(article: String): MutableList<ContentArticle?> {\r\n        val contents: MutableList<ContentArticle?> = ArrayList()\r\n        val doc = Jsoup.parse(article)\r\n        // wrap FIGURE\r\n        val elFigure = doc.select(\"figure\")\r\n        for (i in elFigure.indices) {\r\n            val element = elFigure[i]\r\n            element.wrap(\"<p></p>\")\r\n        }\r\n        val elP = doc.select(\"p\")\r\n        for (el in elP) {\r\n            val v = el.text()\r\n            val p = el.outerHtml()\r\n            val ca = ContentArticle()\r\n            ca.setValue(v)\r\n            ca.setP(p)\r\n            contents.add(ca)\r\n        }\r\n        return contents\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\nFirst of all, i want to wraping all `figure` tag with `<p>`, then i will choose all tag `<p>` and put those all into arraylist object. `p` means all content include with tag, `v` means only value of tag. There is problem with my snippet code? why i got this error?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jhy/jsoup/issues/1397/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jhy/jsoup/issues/1397/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":12942219756,"node_id":"REFE_lADOAAbAPs4QCSjozwAAAAMDapns","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jhy/jsoup/issues/events/12942219756","actor":{"login":"winning1120xx","id":6879244,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4NzkyNDQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6879244?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/winning1120xx","html_url":"https://github.com/winning1120xx","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/winning1120xx/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/winning1120xx/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/winning1120xx/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/winning1120xx/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/winning1120xx/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/winning1120xx/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/winning1120xx/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/winning1120xx/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/winning1120xx/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"f3035cafbbd8830de75f641920f8e5dbf0070f7c","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/winning1120xx/jsoup/commits/f3035cafbbd8830de75f641920f8e5dbf0070f7c","created_at":"2024-05-27T08:08:02Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
