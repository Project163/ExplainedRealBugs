And thanks for the clear report.\n\nThe underlying issue was that as we improved namespace support, the SVG Script element's contents were not parsed as Data, but as regular Text.\n\nIn jsoup, when the Cleaner encounters an unsafe tag and drops it, it preserves that element's Text, but will drop Data.\n\nAs far as I can tell we were parsing foreign content according to the [spec](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/parsing.html#parsing-main-inforeign). There are no tokenization steps there to push the tokenizer into a Data text state, and so the content will be parsed as Text.\n\nHowever on comparison to Chrome I see the content is parsed as Data. So I have added an explicit push to the Data state in jsoup's impl.\n\nI also added support for custom tags when in foreign content to be parsed as data.","author_association":"OWNER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jhy/jsoup/issues/comments/2853047582/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"jhy","id":76934,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc2OTM0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/76934?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy","html_url":"https://github.com/jhy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jhy/jsoup/issues/comments/2853076017","html_url":"https://github.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/2320#issuecomment-2853076017","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jhy/jsoup/issues/2320","id":2853076017,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAAbAPs6qDnwx","user":{"login":"jhy","id":76934,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc2OTM0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/76934?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy","html_url":"https://github.com/jhy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-05-06T02:14:02Z","updated_at":"2025-05-06T02:14:28Z","body":"Just looking at [SVG Script spec](https://www.w3.org/TR/SVGMobile12/script.html#ScriptContentProcessing), the examples have the script content wrapped as `<![CDATA[ ... ]]>`, as its in XML.
