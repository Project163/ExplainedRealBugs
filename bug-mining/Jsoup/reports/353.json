test below using XHTML passes on 1.16.2 and fails on 1.17.1 because it adds another CDATA, generating something like: `...<script><![CDATA[<![CDATA[...]]>]]></script>` and such code causes a javascript error on a browser due to the duplicated CDATA.\r\n```\r\nDocument doc = Jsoup\r\n.parse(\"<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC \\\"-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN\\\"

this problem was introduced by https://github.com/jhy/jsoup/pull/1720\r\n\r\nPlease note that adding CDATA only if the text node doesn't start with `<![CDATA[` will not be enough to fix this, because the `<![CDATA[` expression can be in the middle of the text node. A text node can even have multiple CDATA nodes. But a CDATA node cannot have another CDATA node in it.","closed_by":{"login":"jhy","id":76934,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc2OTM0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/76934?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy","html_url":"https://github.com/jhy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jhy/jsoup/issues/2078/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jhy/jsoup/issues/2078/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
