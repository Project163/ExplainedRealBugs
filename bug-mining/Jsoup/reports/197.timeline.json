I agree, this needs to be reworked. I don't know that we want to bring in Tikka, want to keep the depencies low. My thought is, if we leave it in, to add it to the section where the Connection is tested for MIME type. If there is no MIME type, try and determine if it is binary. Still, that would benefit from an override option, so it might be simplest to remove entirely.
