This causes it to serialize in xml mode as:\r\n\r\n    <rtc></rtc><rt>Month</rt><rt>Day</rt><rt>Year</rt>\r\n\r\nI have checked the behaviour of Firefox and Chrome, and they preserve the `rtc` element structure, e.g.:\r\n\r\n    <rtc><rt>Month</rt><rt>Day</rt><rt>Year</rt></rtc>\r\n\r\nThe `rtc` element is supported in the W3C HTML spec [1], but not the WHATWG spec. Also, even though the `rbc` element is not listed in either of those (only in the Ruby Annotations specification), the jsoup parser preserves the `rbc` element structure.\r\n\r\n[1] https://www.w3.org/TR/2014/REC-html5-20141028/text-level-semantics.html#the-rtc-element","closed_by":{"login":"jhy","id":76934,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc2OTM0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/76934?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy","html_url":"https://github.com/jhy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jhy/jsoup/issues/1294/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jhy/jsoup/issues/1294/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
