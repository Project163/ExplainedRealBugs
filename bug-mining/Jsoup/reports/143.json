The API docs give a nice example of posting JSON:\n\n```\nJsoup.connect(url)\n .requestBody(json)\n .header(\"Content-Type\", \"application/json\")\n .post();\n```\n\nHowever, this doesn’t actually work, because inside of post() it performs an execute() and inside of there it calls setOutputContentType() which resets the Content-Type to the standard form encoding.\n\nThe workaround I discovered is to make sure there is at least one dummy parameter on the call due to the req.data().size() > 0 check on line 555 of HttpConnection.java (jsoup 1.9.2). I did this by adding .data(“dummy”, “”) to the example above and got things working.\n\nI thought I’d point this out so perhaps it can be improved in a future version, if I’ve got this right.\n\nThanks!\n","closed_by":{"login":"jhy","id":76934,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc2OTM0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/76934?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy","html_url":"https://github.com/jhy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jhy/jsoup/issues/756/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jhy/jsoup/issues/756/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
