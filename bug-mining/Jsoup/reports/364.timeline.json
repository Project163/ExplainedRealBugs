me out... I know that JSoup is mostly DOM oriented but I'd like to recommend that we consider adding an optional SAX feature.\r\n\r\nThis is partially related to this issue:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/758\r\n\r\nbut I would like to expand on a description.\r\n\r\nRight now the TreeBuilder functionality implements the parsing we need however there is no way to listen to the parse as it happens.\r\n\r\nWe have some of our queries that are better / faster if they are just implemented together as the document is parsed (rather than CSS selectors).\r\n\r\nThis way we could just elide the searching during the parse to avoid then having to follow up by recursing into the tree.  \r\n\r\nPerhaps \"progress\" can be implemented in the
