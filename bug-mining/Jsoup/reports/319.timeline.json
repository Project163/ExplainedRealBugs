all,\r\n\r\nFirst, thanks a lot for this excellent library!\r\n\r\nI am working on an open-source tool that diffs tree-based languages such as HTML or XML (http://github.com/GumTreeDiff/gumtree), and I wanted to use JSoup to parse HTML and XML files since it is one of the very few parsers I know that has precise source position for the XML/HTML elements. However, I have remarked that this information is not present for the attributes, and it prevents me from fully diffing these files, as attribute name or value modifications are frequent.\r\n\r\nWould it be possible to add source location information for attribute keys and values? Or do you have an idea for a workaround?\r\n\r\nThanks in advance.\r\n\r\nCheers!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n ","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jhy/jsoup/issues/1933/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jhy/jsoup/issues/1933/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":11078078308,"node_id":"REFE_lADOAAbAPs54Ad7jzwAAAAKUTg9k","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jhy/jsoup/issues/events/11078078308","actor":{"login":"jhy","id":76934,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc2OTM0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/76934?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy","html_url":"https://github.com/jhy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"244db10b40f6b8138747a99d93d95eb57bf47156","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jhy/jsoup/commits/244db10b40f6b8138747a99d93d95eb57bf47156","created_at":"2023-11-28T02:37:14Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":11358078960,"node_id":"REFE_lADOAAbAPs54Ad7jzwAAAAKk_ofw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jhy/jsoup/issues/events/11358078960","actor":{"login":"benkard","id":57626,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3NjI2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/57626?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/benkard","html_url":"https://github.com/benkard","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benkard/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benkard/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benkard/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benkard/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benkard/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benkard/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benkard/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benkard/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benkard/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"af047ff8cf944cbc615e21f105781e48c2bb2a18","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/benkard/mulkcms2/commits/af047ff8cf944cbc615e21f105781e48c2bb2a18","created_at":"2023-12-29T18:01:08Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":11668497444,"node_id":"REFE_lADOAAbAPs54Ad7jzwAAAAK3fyQk","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jhy/jsoup/issues/events/11668497444","actor":{"login":"rensx","id":46339813,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ2MzM5ODEz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/46339813?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rensx","html_url":"https://github.com/rensx","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rensx/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rensx/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rensx/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rensx/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rensx/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rensx/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rensx/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rensx/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rensx/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"fc4b175e02df2ceabdec9371d1874a014a35472d","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/rensx/jsoup/commits/fc4b175e02df2ceabdec9371d1874a014a35472d","created_at":"2024-02-01T11:10:48Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
