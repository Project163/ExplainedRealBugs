The function would return all parent elements of the current Element. Or, given an optional parameter, would filter based on that.\n\nSo if you for example selected all bold text with `Elements elems = doc.select('b')` you could then find all bold tags that were in paragraphs with `elems.parents('p')`, and that would select the paragraphs themselves if you wanted to do some processing on them.\n\nYou could also add the optional selector to the parent() function too - although it is as easy in this case to simply select the parent and check if the tag or class etc matches.\n","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jhy/jsoup/issues/20/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jhy/jsoup/issues/20/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
