org.jsoup.safety.Whitelist; use\r\norg.jsoup.safety.Safelist instead).</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>\r\n<p>Improvement: when converting jsoup Documents to W3C Documents in W3CDom, preserve HTML valid attribute names if the\r\ninput document is using the HTML syntax. (Previously, would always coerce using the more restrictive XML syntax.)\r\n<a href=\"https://github.com/jhy/jsoup/pull/1648\">jhy/jsoup#1648</a></p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>\r\n<p>Improvement: added the :containsWholeText(text) selector, to match against non-normalized Element text. That can be\r\nuseful when elements can only be distinguished by e.g. specific case, or leading whitespace, etc.\r\n<a href=\"https://github.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/1636\">jhy/jsoup#1636</a></p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>\r\n<p>Improvement: added Element#wholeOwnText() to retrieve the original (non-normalized) ownText of an Element. Also\r\nadded the :containsWholeOwnText(text) selector, to match against that.
