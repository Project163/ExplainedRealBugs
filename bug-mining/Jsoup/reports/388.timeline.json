Given the javascript requirement and sources on the page, I expect that is what is causing the tree difference. Remember that jsoup parses HTML, and does not execute javascript.\r\n\r\nUsing the Firefox debugger to generate or execute the XPath will only show you the results from Firefox's DOM post javascript execution.\r\n\r\nMy suggestion would be to simplify your query, and to use [Try.jsoup](https://try.jsoup.org/~ew4oLDXm0IiAFVAvPioBgUKUekI) to iteratively validate it.

Thank you so much 😊\r\n\r\n> > Unfortunately, I don't know anything other than the absolute xpath of the element a priori for my use case, so I cannot use any more direct xpath expression.\r\n> \r\n> Interesting, can you expand on what the use case is?\r\n\r\nI'd love to, I hope to come back to this comment an drop a link to a paper once I'm done. \r\n\r\nBut the short version is I'm a grad student working on a system to extract the 'meanings' of button clicks that were captured from user interaction traces. The traces contain these xpaths, and then I process the elements/html context near those elements to determine what task/purpose that button click/input interaction was trying to accomplish. \r\n\r\nWhen I wrote the software producing the traces, it felt simpler to have it compute absolute xpaths for elements since the same logic could work for any element on any page. \r\n\r\nNow that I think about it, I guess I could have made some attempts at generating shorter xpath expressions that resolve uniquely to a given element. I think the [Selenium IDE](https://www.selenium.dev/selenium-ide/) has a feature like that where it proposes a range of locators xpath/CSS query for selecting arbitrary elements on the page. Might add it to the back burner of ideas to explore. \r\n\r\nBut yeah, I've seen some pretty gnarly attribute abuse with some of the html I'm working with. I'll have to double check my own processing pipelines aren't causing it somewhere, because that specific element was definitely the title attribute value leaking it's contents all over the place. \r\n\r\nEither way, thanks again for patching this obscure edge case.\r\n\r\n","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jhy/jsoup/issues/comments/2536517692/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"aianta","id":8941479,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg5NDE0Nzk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8941479?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aianta","html_url":"https://github.com/aianta","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aianta/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aianta/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aianta/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aianta/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aianta/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aianta/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aianta/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aianta/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aianta/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jhy/jsoup/issues/comments/2537372726","html_url":"https://github.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/2244#issuecomment-2537372726","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jhy/jsoup/issues/2244","id":2537372726,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAAbAPs6XPTw2","user":{"login":"jhy","id":76934,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc2OTM0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/76934?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy","html_url":"https://github.com/jhy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-12-11T22:59:12Z","updated_at":"2024-12-11T22:59:29Z","body":"Sounds
