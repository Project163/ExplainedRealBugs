I'm trying to reproduce this using Jsoup 1.15.2 and Java 17.0.4 since I don't have Kotlin installed on my machine and the following code snippet produces a space between `ipsum</p> <span>` as well when I use the `Jsoup.parse()` method without the `text()` method.\r\n\r\n```\r\nDocument jsoupHtml() throws IOException {\r\n    String multiLineHtml = \"\"\"\r\n        <h1>This is my
