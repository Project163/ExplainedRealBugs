JSoup\nseems to \"eat up\" the rest of the document in its parsing and thus no elements after\nthe unclosed tag are available after the parse.\n\nWhile this is obviously not a valid document Firefox seems to handle it OK by displaying\nthe document and saying \"Untitled document\" in its title bar.\n\nWe come across a lot of badly formed documents in our web crawls so having a fix\nfor this issue would be much appreciated. I've given some sample source below\nwhich demonstrates the bug (tested against JSoup 1.5.2).\n\nMany thanks,\n- Francis.\n\nimport org.jsoup.Jsoup;\nimport org.jsoup.nodes.Document;\nimport org.jsoup.nodes.Element;\nimport org.jsoup.select.Elements;\n\npublic class UnclosedTitleTest {\n\n```\npublic static void main(String args[]) throws Exception {\n    String html = \"<html><head><title>First parse</head>\"\n          + \"<body><p>Parsed HTML into a doc.</p></body></html>\";\n    Document doc = Jsoup.parse(html);\n\n    Elements elements = doc.select(\"p\");\n\n    for (Element element : elements) {\n        System.out.println(element.outerHtml());\n    }\n}\n```\n\n}\n","closed_by":{"login":"jhy","id":76934,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc2OTM0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/76934?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy","html_url":"https://github.com/jhy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jhy/jsoup/issues/82/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jhy/jsoup/issues/82/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
