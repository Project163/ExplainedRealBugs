If no children, returns an empty list.`\r\n\r\nBut in the case of a LeafNode, which has no children, it throws `UnsupportedOperationException`. This is because `childNodes()` calls `ensureChildNodes()`, which throws an exception when called on a `LeafNode`.\r\n\r\nThe result is that the calling application needs to guard against this case. But the application should not need to know if the `Node` it has is a `LeafNode` or not.\r\n\r\n`LeafNode.childNodes()` should simply return an empty list as it used to do, and as per the javadoc.\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"jhy","id":76934,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc2OTM0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/76934?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy","html_url":"https://github.com/jhy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jhy/jsoup/issues/1032/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jhy/jsoup/issues/1032/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
