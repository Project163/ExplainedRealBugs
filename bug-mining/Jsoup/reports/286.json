there,\r\n\r\nThe implementation of the `Element.data()` function listed below is executed recursively in an unsafe manner.\r\n\r\n```\r\n    public String data() {\r\n        StringBuilder sb = StringUtil.borrowBuilder();\r\n\r\n        for (Node childNode : childNodes) {\r\n            if (childNode instanceof DataNode) {\r\n                DataNode data = (DataNode) childNode;\r\n                sb.append(data.getWholeData());\r\n            } else if (childNode instanceof Comment) {\r\n                Comment comment = (Comment) childNode;\r\n                sb.append(comment.getData());\r\n            } else if (childNode instanceof Element) {\r\n                Element element = (Element) childNode;\r\n                String elementData = element.data();\r\n                sb.append(elementData);\r\n            } else if (childNode instanceof CDataNode) {\r\n                // this shouldn't really happen because the html parser won't see the cdata as anything special when parsing script.\r\n                // but incase another type gets through.\r\n                CDataNode cDataNode = (CDataNode) childNode;\r\n                sb.append(cDataNode.getWholeText());\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n        return StringUtil.releaseBuilder(sb);\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe recursion is not checked for depth and can lead to a `StackOverflowError` if there are enough nested children.\r\n\r\nI suggest to handle this case similar to `Element.text()` where a `NodeTraversor` is used to compute the result iteratively.\r\n\r\nAnother approach could be something along the lines:\r\n\r\n```\r\n    public String data() {\r\n\t\tStringBuilder sb = StringUtil.borrowBuilder();\r\n\r\n\t\tvar descendants = new ArrayDeque<>(childNodes);\r\n\t\twhile (!descendants.isEmpty()) {\r\n\t\t\tvar descendantNode = descendants.pollFirst();\r\n\t\t\tif (descendantNode instanceof DataNode) {\r\n\t\t\t\tDataNode data = (DataNode) descendantNode;\r\n\t\t\t\tsb.append(data.getWholeData());\r\n\t\t\t}\r\n\t\t\telse if (descendantNode instanceof Comment) {\r\n\t\t\t\tComment comment = (Comment) descendantNode;\r\n\t\t\t\tsb.append(comment.getData());\r\n\t\t\t}\r\n\t\t\telse if (descendantNode instanceof Element) {\r\n\t\t\t\tElement element = (Element) descendantNode;\r\n\t\t\t\t// We must visit the first child on the list next.\r\n\t\t\t\t// If this, in turn, has children, his children are visited next, and so on.\r\n\t\t\t\t// Therefore, we have to append the child nodes of this parent backward to the front of the queue.\r\n\t\t\t\tvar childNodes = element.childNodes();\r\n\t\t\t\tfor (int i = childNodes.size() - 1; i > 0; i--) {\r\n\t\t\t\t\tdescendants.addFirst(childNodes.get(i));\r\n\t\t\t\t}\r\n\t\t\t}\r\n\t\t\telse if (descendantNode instanceof CDataNode) {\r\n\t\t\t\t// this shouldn't really happen because the html parser won't see the cdata as anything special when parsing script.\r\n\t\t\t\t// but incase another type gets through.\r\n\t\t\t\tCDataNode cDataNode = (CDataNode) descendantNode;\r\n\t\t\t\tsb.append(cDataNode.getWholeText());\r\n\t\t\t}\r\n\t\t}\r\n\t\treturn StringUtil.releaseBuilder(sb);\r\n```","closed_by":{"login":"jhy","id":76934,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc2OTM0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/76934?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy","html_url":"https://github.com/jhy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jhy/jsoup/issues/1864/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jhy/jsoup/issues/1864/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
