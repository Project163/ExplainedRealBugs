Because of using quotes in :contains and [attribute] matching, we can't make `:contains(Text \" Text)` work. So the solution for you (looking for a quote) will be to escape that quote, like `:contains(Text \\\" Text)` (and remember to double escape in source code, once for Java, once for the CSS; just like a regex). See the committed test case.\r\n\r\nTo make it more obvious what's going wrong, if an unbalanced quote or parentheses is found, jsoup now throws an exception.\r\n\r\nHope this helps!","author_association":"OWNER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jhy/jsoup/issues/comments/270825312/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"jhy","id":76934,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc2OTM0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/76934?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy","html_url":"https://github.com/jhy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":7154977211,"node_id":"CDE_lADOAAbAPs4LzOHCzwAAAAGqeEm7","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jhy/jsoup/issues/events/7154977211","actor":{"login":"ghost","id":10137,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMTM3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10137?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost","html_url":"https://github.com/ghost","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"comment_deleted","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2022-08-09T12:19:31Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":12942219330,"node_id":"REFE_lADOAAbAPs4LzOHCzwAAAAMDaphC","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jhy/jsoup/issues/events/12942219330","actor":{"login":"winning1120xx","id":6879244,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4NzkyNDQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6879244?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/winning1120xx","html_url":"https://github.com/winning1120xx","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/winning1120xx/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/winning1120xx/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/winning1120xx/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/winning1120xx/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/winning1120xx/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/winning1120xx/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/winning1120xx/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/winning1120xx/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/winning1120xx/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"8fecf72da0c9d1d6da7ec1aab0214ff68588da88","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/winning1120xx/jsoup/commits/8fecf72da0c9d1d6da7ec1aab0214ff68588da88","created_at":"2024-05-27T08:08:01Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
