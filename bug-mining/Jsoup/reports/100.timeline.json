an upgrade from 1.7.1 to 1.8.3 we have come across an issue that could be a bug, but also could be a misunderstanding.\n### Setup test\n\nTo setup the test, we start with a simple HTML example:\n\n``` html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n    <body>\n        <div>word</div>\n        <div>word</div>\n    </body>\n</html>\n```\n\nAnd then create en Elements object like this:\n\n``` java\nDocument document = Jsoup.parse(\"<!DOCTYPE html>...etc...</html>\");\nElements elements = document.select(\"div\");\n```\n### Unexpected/Inconsistent behaviour\n\nIf a `.select()` is run on the `elements` object, it only finds a single instance. E.g. this passes in 1.8.3 but not in 1.7.1:\n\n``` java\nint elementsFoundUsingSelect = elements.select(\":contains(word)\").size();\nAssert.assertEquals(\"should find two but finds one\", 1, elementsFoundUsingSelect);\n```\n\nOn the other hand, if I loop over the `elements` object and run a select on each `Element`, I get the following:\n\n``` java\nint elementsFoundUsingSelect = elements.select(\":contains(word)\").size();\nint elementsFoundUsingLoop = 0;\nfor (Element element : elements) {\n    if (element.select(\"table:contains(word)\").size() > 0) {\n        elementsFoundUsingLoop++;\n    }\n}\nAssert.assertEquals(\"should find two\", 2, elementsFoundUsingLoop);\n```\n### Expected behaviour\n\nI would expect `elements.select(\":contains(word)\")` to return two elements, but in 1.8.3 it only returns one element.\n### Other notes\n\nIt appears that when the selected HTML content is identical (e.g. the two `<div>` elements in the above example are identical) than running a `.select()` on the `Elements` object will only select the first object.\n### What do I do?\n\nWhich behaviour is correct? Am I misunderstanding the documentation?\n- Previously we were relying on the 1.7.1 behaviour to find all instances of an identical element, and then navigate from _each_ of those using `Elements.select()`\n- However in 1.8.3 you can find all instances of identical elements, but you can't navigate from them using `Elements.select()` as it will only `select()` within the first one.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jhy/jsoup/issues/614/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jhy/jsoup/issues/614/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"actor":{"login":"saibotsivad","id":91254,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkxMjU0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/91254?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/saibotsivad","html_url":"https://github.com/saibotsivad","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/saibotsivad/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/saibotsivad/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/saibotsivad/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/saibotsivad/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/saibotsivad/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/saibotsivad/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/saibotsivad/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/saibotsivad/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/saibotsivad/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-08-25T20:36:32Z","updated_at":"2015-08-25T20:36:32Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jhy/jsoup/issues/616","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jhy/jsoup","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jhy/jsoup/issues/616/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jhy/jsoup/issues/616/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jhy/jsoup/issues/616/events","html_url":"https://github.com/jhy/jsoup/pull/616","id":103110871,"node_id":"MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0NDMzMzMzNjA=","number":616,"title":"Add
