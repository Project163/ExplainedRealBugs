are using jsoup inside XWiki to perform some page validation as part of our integrations tests and we noticed a regression after the upgrade from jsoup 1.12.1 to 1.12.2. When accessing a particular page, we obtained the following:\r\n```\r\nException in thread \"main\" java.io.IOException: Mark invalid\r\n\tat org.jsoup.parser.CharacterReader.rewindToMark(CharacterReader.java:148)\r\n\tat org.jsoup.parser.Tokeniser.consumeCharacterReference(Tokeniser.java:192)\r\n\tat org.jsoup.parser.TokeniserState$38.read(TokeniserState.java:759)\r\n\tat org.jsoup.parser.Tokeniser.read(Tokeniser.java:59)\r\n\tat org.jsoup.parser.TreeBuilder.runParser(TreeBuilder.java:55)\r\n\tat org.jsoup.parser.TreeBuilder.parse(TreeBuilder.java:47)\r\n\tat org.jsoup.parser.Parser.parseInput(Parser.java:35)\r\n\tat org.jsoup.helper.DataUtil.parseInputStream(DataUtil.java:170)\r\n\tat org.jsoup.helper.DataUtil.load(DataUtil.java:66)\r\n\tat org.jsoup.Jsoup.parse(Jsoup.java:118)\r\n\tat Main.main(Main.java:47)\r\n```\r\n\r\nI've been able to isolate and reproduce in a \"small\" setup, but it still needs an XWiki instance.\r\nHere's the small Java code I'm using for reproduction:\r\n```\r\nGetMethod method = new GetMethod(\"http://127.0.0.1:8080/xwiki/bin/admin/XWiki/XWikiPreferences?editor=globaladmin&section=Groups\");\r\nmethod.setFollowRedirects(true);\r\nmethod.getParams().setSoTimeout(30000);\r\nmethod.setDoAuthentication(true);\r\nmethod.addRequestHeader(\"Authorization\",\"Basic \" + new String(Base64.encodeBase64(\"Admin:admin\".getBytes())));\r\nnew HttpClient().executeMethod(method);\r\nbyte[] response = method.getResponseBody();\r\nmethod.releaseConnection();\r\n\r\nJsoup.parse(new ByteArrayInputStream(response), null, \"\");\r\n```\r\n\r\nBefore running this, you need to download an instance of XWiki 12.0 (http://maven.xwiki.org/releases/org/xwiki/platform/xwiki-platform-distribution-flavor-jetty-hsqldb/12.0/xwiki-platform-distribution-flavor-jetty-hsqldb-12.0.zip), unzip it, start it using the bash script (`./start_xwiki.sh`) and open a browser with `http://localhost:8080` to be sure everything's loaded. \r\n\r\nI checked with 1.12.1 and I confirm I didn't reproduce with it.","closed_by":{"login":"jhy","id":76934,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc2OTM0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/76934?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy","html_url":"https://github.com/jhy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jhy/jsoup/issues/1324/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jhy/jsoup/issues/1324/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
