beginning with a double slash are valid type of URL called a protocol relative URL ([RFC 3986 section 4.2](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986#section-4.2)). In jsoup they have the same behaviour as other types of relative URLs. That is you need to specify a base URL to be able to resolve a relative URL (See: [Node#absUrl](http://jsoup.org/apidocs/org/jsoup/nodes/Node.html#absUrl%28java.lang.String%29))\n\n``` java\nString
