for reporting this and the test repro. I've committed a fix. \r\n\r\nThe problem was that the TokeniserState checked if the CharacterReader was empty before trying to read an end tag, and the isEmpty() method didn't buffer in new contents. So if an end tag just happened to be on a buffer read boundary, isEmpty() would return false, and would cause the tokenizer to read the next section as plain text given its fallback path.\r\n\r\nFixed by making isEmpty do a buffer up when called externally (not when internal, which would mix the bufPos counter

Statement\r\n-----------------\r\n\r\nOn OSX, users sometimes get an empty role list while Linux users do not\r\nesperience problems. This holds even true when the same Docker image is\r\nused.\r\n\r\nSolution\r\n--------\r\n\r\nWe tracked this down to the document in `AwsSamlSigninParser` (the HTML document\r\nthat represents the HTML page AWS presents for selecting roles after login to\r\nOkta) being broken judging by string representation of the `Document` object.\r\nHowever, we noticed when converting the HTML response to a string before\r\npassing it to `Jsoup.parse`, the error disappeared:\r\n\r\n```java\r\n    // in AwsSamlRoleUtils.getSigninPageDocument\r\n    Scanner s = new Scanner(samlSigninResponse.getEntity().getContent()).useDelimiter(\"\\\\A\");\r\n    String result = s.hasNext() ? s.next() : \"\";\r\n    System.out.println(result);\r\n    return Jsoup.parse(\r\n\t    result,\r\n\t    \"https://signin.aws.amazon.com/saml\"\r\n    );\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis lead us to the conclusion that this might be a race condition that\r\nonly happens when Jsoup is passed an `InputStream` which could explain why it\r\nonly happens on OSX and not Linux: Such things can propagate down right to the\r\noperating system through boundaries of VM/Docker.\r\n\r\nJudging from Jsoup's changelog from 1.11.2 to 1.11.3, there is a\r\nparticular [change](https://github.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/995) that sounds\r\nlike this could be the solution. Anyways, when updating to the latest\r\nversion, the error disappears completely on our OSX machines.\r\n\r\nThis is a critical bug for our company and we would be glad if this would result into a new release as soon as possible.
