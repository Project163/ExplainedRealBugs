uses the default locale for the case conversion. This can lead to undesired results when using the Turkish locale (see the blog post linked in issue #256).\r\n\r\nThis pull request adds some tests to make sure jsoup's behavior is independent of the default locale. `MultiLocaleRule` runs every test annotated with `@MultiLocaleTest` twice. Once with `Locale.ENGLISH` as the default locale and once with Turkish as the default value.\r\n\r\nThis does not fix content matching issues with non-ASCII data, e.g. the one described in issue #474.
