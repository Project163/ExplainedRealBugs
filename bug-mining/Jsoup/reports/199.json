// this calls LeafNode.ensureAttributes() and creates attributes map\r\n/* 3 */ TextNode y = (TextNode) x.clone();\r\n/* 4 */ y.text(\"xxx\"); // now x.text() is also \"xxx\"\r\n```\r\n- Here, on step `1` we create a new `TextNode` with a `value` of `zzz`.\r\n- On step `2` `ensureAttributes()` is called indirectly, which replaces `String` `value` with `Attributes` containing `#text = zzz` entry.\r\n- On step `3` we clone the node.\r\n- If we inspect properties after step `3` we'll notice that `x.attributes()` and `y.attributes()` are returning the same instance\r\n- On step `4` we update content of `y`, which is \"magically\" mirrored to `x` as well.\r\n\r\nIn `1.10.3` attributes were explicitly cloned in `Node.doClone()` method, but starting with `1.11.1` `attributes` were moved to `TextNode` and then to `LeafNode` without any clone implementation.","closed_by":{"login":"jhy","id":76934,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc2OTM0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/76934?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy","html_url":"https://github.com/jhy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jhy/jsoup/issues/1176/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jhy/jsoup/issues/1176/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
