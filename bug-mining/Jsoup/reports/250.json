now, we don't support the `template` tag correctly, and there are few issues filed regarding that.\r\n\r\nParticularly, the tree builder and states need to be updated to meet the current spec. There's a concept of a template state stack.\r\n\r\nAs far as an implementation in jsoup goes:\r\n - parse -> serialize should be pass through (which is the main gap now - as it's unknown, template in head will boot the tree builder to the body state, and similarly within tables)\r\n - following the principle of least surprise, contents of a template element will be visible to selectors on the owner doc (so the contents of a template will not be contained in a document fragment; in script-enabled browsers they are so that script execution and layout doesn't expose them)\r\n - easy to use as actual templates via clone, modify, append, unwrap et al\r\n\r\nOther than the basics, I'm keen to hear everyone's view on this and what could improve the functionality. And of use cases that you've come across that would be good to optimize for.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"jhy","id":76934,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc2OTM0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/76934?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy","html_url":"https://github.com/jhy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jhy/jsoup/issues/1634/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jhy/jsoup/issues/1634/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
