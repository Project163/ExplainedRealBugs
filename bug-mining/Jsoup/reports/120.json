Here's a simplified/reduced version.\n\n```\npackage test;\n\nimport java.io.ByteArrayInputStream;\nimport java.io.InputStream;\nimport java.nio.charset.Charset;\n\nimport org.jsoup.Jsoup;\nimport org.jsoup.nodes.Document;\nimport org.jsoup.nodes.Entities.EscapeMode;\nimport org.junit.Assert;\nimport org.junit.Test;\n\npublic class ShiftJisTest {\n\n    @Test\n    public void testShiftJisRoundtrip() throws Exception {\n        String input = \n            \"<html>\"\n          +   \"<head>\"\n          +     \"<meta http-equiv=\\\"content-type\\\" content=\\\"text/html; charset=Shift_JIS\\\" />\"\n          +   \"</head>\"\n          +   \"<body>\"\n          +     \"before&nbsp;after\"\n          +   \"</body>\"\n          + \"</html>\";\n        InputStream is = new ByteArrayInputStream(input.getBytes(Charset.forName(\"ASCII\")));\n\n        Document doc = Jsoup.parse(is, null, \"http://example.com\");\n        doc.outputSettings().escapeMode(EscapeMode.xhtml);\n\n        String output = new String(doc.html().getBytes(doc.outputSettings().charset()), doc.outputSettings().charset());\n\n        System.out.println(output);\n\n        Assert.assertFalse(\"Should not have contained a '?'.\", output.contains(\"?\"));\n        Assert.assertTrue(\"Should have contained a '&#xa0;' or a '&nbsp;'.\", \n            output.contains(\"&#xa0;\") || output.contains(\"&nbsp;\"));\n    }\n\n}\n```\n\nUnder JSoup 1.7.2, the body of the output in this test is \"before&#xa0;after\" (which looks as expected when rendered in Firefox), where as under 1.8.1 it is \"before?after\".\n\nI assume the issue here is that I've asked JSoup to escape only XHTML characters (i.e. not nbsp), and it's producing a charset where (I assume) there's no character to represent 'non-breaking space'.\n\nThe upshot of this is that, as a result of upgrading JSoup, I end up with '?' replaced in for what used to be shown as a non breaking space.\n\nIt seems like the old behaviour was to fall back to providing an escaped numeric character (odd if there's no valid character for that in Shift_JIS, but it still rendered correctly). From my perspective, the old behaviour was better - Is there any way it can be reinstated (or an escape mode provided for it)?\n\nObviously using EscapeMode.base instead of EscapeMode.xhtml is a possible workaround, however I would really prefer not to have characters unnecessarily escaped if possible.\n","closed_by":{"login":"jhy","id":76934,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc2OTM0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/76934?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy","html_url":"https://github.com/jhy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jhy/jsoup/issues/523/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jhy/jsoup/issues/523/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
