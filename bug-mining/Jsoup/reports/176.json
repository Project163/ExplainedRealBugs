Example test case:\r\n\r\n```\r\n    @Test\r\n    public void test() {\r\n        Document document = Jsoup.parse(\r\n                \"<html><head></head><body><hr size=\\\"1\\\" noshade=\\\"\\\"></body></html>\");\r\n        assertEquals(\"<html>\\n\" +\r\n                     \" <head></head>\\n\" +\r\n                     \" <body>\\n\" +\r\n                     \"  <hr size=\\\"1\\\" noshade>\\n\" +\r\n                     \" </body>\\n\" +\r\n                     \"</html>\",\r\n                     document.outerHtml());\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\nTracked it down to commit \"Refactored Attributes to be an array pair vs LinkedHashSet \" ea1fb65. The `Attibutes.html(final Appendable accum, final Document.OutputSettings out)` method no longer uses `Attribute` and **fails** to check the value of the attribute for an _empty string_(line 320). \r\n\r\nIf I may also suggest to use `Attribute.shouldCollapseAttribute(String key, String val, Document.OutputSettings out)` instead as a single source of truth as the boolean expression is complex enough and easy to make a mistake. Not sure if this would have an impact in performance though but I am guessing that optimizer will inline the call at some point anyways?
