have an issue when trying to use the same connection after submitting the form.\r\nThe method `newRequest()` makes copy `data` params and it leads that this request preserve data from previous request.\r\nThere is no way to clean up `data` params. So when I use the same connection to \"navigate link\" it serializes data params as query parameters:\r\n```java\r\ndocument.connection().newRequest()\r\n                    .url(confirmationUrl)\r\n                    .get();\r\n```\r\nAnd moreover it will keep send data from previous form if you use subsequence of form submit calls.\r\nhttps://github.com/jhy/jsoup/blob/b0ac5e06a75cfe00ab010291c9df03cbbf8d655d/src/main/java/org/jsoup/nodes/FormElement.java#L72-L75\r\n\r\nI believe we shouldn't do a copy of  `data` params here:\r\nhttps://github.com/jhy/jsoup/blob/b0ac5e06a75cfe00ab010291c9df03cbbf8d655d/src/main/java/org/jsoup/helper/HttpConnection.java#L671","closed_by":{"login":"jhy","id":76934,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc2OTM0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/76934?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy","html_url":"https://github.com/jhy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jhy/jsoup/issues/1778/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jhy/jsoup/issues/1778/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
