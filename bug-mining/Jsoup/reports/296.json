I configure the parser to track positions and feed in the fragment `<table>foo<tr><td>bar</td></tr></table>`, both `foo` and `bar` get parsed as text nodes. However, the source range for `foo` contains invalid start/end positions. I realise `foo` is a misplaced text, but is there a specific reason why we do not populate the positions? Also, I see the same unexpected behaviour if I add whitespaces between `<table>` and `<tr>`. The resulting text node contains invalid positions.\r\n\r\nHere's a simple test program:\r\n```\r\nimport org.jsoup.nodes.Document;\r\nimport org.jsoup.nodes.Node;\r\nimport org.jsoup.nodes.Range;\r\nimport org.jsoup.nodes.TextNode;\r\nimport org.jsoup.parser.HtmlTreeBuilder;\r\nimport org.jsoup.parser.Parser;\r\nimport org.jsoup.select.NodeTraversor;\r\n\r\npublic class Test {\r\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\r\n        HtmlTreeBuilder treeBuilder = new HtmlTreeBuilder();\r\n        Parser parser = new Parser(treeBuilder);\r\n        parser.setTrackPosition(true);\r\n        Document document = parser.parseInput(\"<table>foo<tr><td>bar</td></tr></table>\", \"\");\r\n        NodeTraversor.traverse((Node node, int depth) -> {\r\n            if (node instanceof TextNode textNode) {\r\n                Range sourceRange = textNode.sourceRange();\r\n                System.out.printf(\"text=%s start=%d end=%d%n\",\r\n                    textNode.text(),\r\n                    sourceRange.start().pos(),\r\n                    sourceRange.end().pos());\r\n            }\r\n        }, document);\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\nAnd the unexpected output:\r\n```\r\n$ java -cp ~/.m2/repository/org/jsoup/jsoup/1.15.4/jsoup-1.15.4.jar Test.java \r\ntext=foo start=0 end=-1    # start/end positions are invalid here\r\ntext=bar start=18 end=21\r\n```","closed_by":{"login":"jhy","id":76934,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc2OTM0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/76934?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy","html_url":"https://github.com/jhy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jhy/jsoup/issues/1927/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jhy/jsoup/issues/1927/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
