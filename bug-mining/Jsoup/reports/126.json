Maybe calling reindexChildren() inside the loop in addChildren() fixes this.\nVersion 1.8.3.\nWorkaround: call remove() on the elements before passing them to insertChildren()\n\nEasy Test Case:\n\n```\n    @Test\n    public void mustCorrectlyMoveChildrenInsideOneParentElement() {\n\n        Document doc = new Document( \"\" );\n        Element body = doc.appendElement( \"body\" );\n        body.appendElement( \"div1\" );\n        body.appendElement( \"div2\" );\n        Element div3 = body.appendElement( \"div3\" );\n        Element div4 = body.appendElement( \"div4\" );\n\n        ArrayList<Element> toMove = new ArrayList<Element>() {\n            {\n                add( div3 );\n                add( div4 );\n            }\n        };\n\n        body.insertChildren( 0, toMove );\n\n        String result = doc.toString().replaceAll( \"\\\\s+\", \"\" );\n        assertEquals( \"<body><div3></div3><div4></div4><div1></div1><div2></div2></body>\", result );\n\n    }\n```\n","closed_by":{"login":"jhy","id":76934,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc2OTM0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/76934?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy","html_url":"https://github.com/jhy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jhy/jsoup/issues/689/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jhy/jsoup/issues/689/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
