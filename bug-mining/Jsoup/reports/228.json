version 1.9.2, processing instructions are not correctly parsed any more.\r\nHere is sample code for reproducing the issue.\r\n\r\n```\r\npackage jsoupbug;\r\n\r\nimport java.util.List;\r\nimport org.jsoup.Jsoup;\r\nimport org.jsoup.nodes.Document;\r\nimport org.jsoup.nodes.Node;\r\nimport org.jsoup.parser.Parser;\r\n\r\npublic class JsoupBug {\r\n\r\n    private static final String XML = \"<?xml version=\\\"1.0\\\" encoding=\\\"utf-8\\\"?>\\n<?myProcessingInstruction My Processing instruction.?>\";\r\n\r\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\r\n        Document document = Jsoup.parse(XML, \"\", Parser.xmlParser());\r\n        document.outputSettings().prettyPrint(false);\r\n        List<Node> nodes = document.childNodes();\r\n        Node node = nodes.get(2);\r\n        String outerHtml = node.outerHtml();\r\n        System.out.println(outerHtml);\r\n    }\r\n\r\n}\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen I correctly understand the spec (https://www.w3.org/TR/REC-xml/#sec-pi) spaces are valid characters for processing instructions, but Jsoup messes things up.\r\n\r\nWith version 1.9.2 this prints:\r\n`<?myprocessingInstruction my=\"\" processing=\"\" instruction.=\"\"?>`\r\nHowever in 1.9.1 the behavior is as I would expect:\r\n`<?myProcessingInstruction My Processing instruction.?>`","closed_by":{"login":"jhy","id":76934,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc2OTM0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/76934?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy","html_url":"https://github.com/jhy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jhy/jsoup/issues/770/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jhy/jsoup/issues/770/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
