CData is an encoding mechanism, similar to escapes. That data is still destined for the DOM. The problem here is in serialization; you expect the CData input to be re-serialized back into CData.\n\nI think that's the right approach. We need to track data sections and make sure they serialize back into CData.\n","author_association":"OWNER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jhy/jsoup/issues/comments/60128277/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"jhy","id":76934,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc2OTM0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/76934?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy","html_url":"https://github.com/jhy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":182288017,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MTgyMjg4MDE3","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jhy/jsoup/issues/events/182288017","actor":{"login":"ataraxie","id":1646086,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NDYwODY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1646086?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ataraxie","html_url":"https://github.com/ataraxie","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ataraxie/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ataraxie/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ataraxie/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ataraxie/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ataraxie/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ataraxie/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ataraxie/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ataraxie/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ataraxie/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2014-10-22T18:05:39Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":182288018,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDE4MjI4ODAxOA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jhy/jsoup/issues/events/182288018","actor":{"login":"ataraxie","id":1646086,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NDYwODY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1646086?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ataraxie","html_url":"https://github.com/ataraxie","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ataraxie/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ataraxie/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ataraxie/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ataraxie/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ataraxie/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ataraxie/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ataraxie/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ataraxie/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ataraxie/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2014-10-22T18:05:39Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jhy/jsoup/issues/comments/60202206","html_url":"https://github.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/406#issuecomment-60202206","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jhy/jsoup/issues/406","id":60202206,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYwMjAyMjA2","user":{"login":"ataraxie","id":1646086,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NDYwODY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1646086?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ataraxie","html_url":"https://github.com/ataraxie","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ataraxie/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ataraxie/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ataraxie/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ataraxie/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ataraxie/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ataraxie/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ataraxie/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ataraxie/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ataraxie/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-10-23T07:32:46Z","updated_at":"2014-10-23T07:32:46Z","body":"That's right. Let me clarify: we are using Jsoup to replace content in an XHTML document. To be more exact, we're replacing content of pages in [Atlassian Confluence](https://www.atlassian.com/de/software/confluence). The storage format of the page content is XHTML. Upon page view this XHTML is rendered using different rendering mechanisms. Now, there is some data in the XHTML code that is stored in CDATA meta tags. If this is not present, the page won't render correctly. That means if we do a Parse - Manipulate - Serialize and the CDATA is gone, pages won't render correctly. This bug has actually been quite a problem for us, since there were suddenly corrupt pages in our Confluence and we had a hard time figuring out what the problem was.\n\nWe already repaired everything in our instance, so it's cool.
