8.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Change: updated the minimum Android API level from 8 to 10.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Change: although Node#childNodes() returns an UnmodifiableList as a view into its children, it was still\ndirectly backed by the internal child list. That made some uses, such as looping and moving those children to\nanother element, throw a ConcurrentModificationException. Now this method returns its own list so that they are\nseparated and changes to the parent's contents will not impact the children view. This aligns with similar methods\nsuch as Element#children(). If you have code that iterates this list and makes parenting changes to its contents,\nyou may need to make a code update.\n<a href=\"https://github.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/1431\">jhy/jsoup#1431</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: renamed the Whitelist class to Safelist, with the goal of more inclusive language. A shim is provided\nfor backwards compatibility (source and binary). This shim is marked as deprecated and will be removed in the\njsoup 1.15.1 release.\n<a href=\"https://github.com/jhy/jsoup/pull/1464\">jhy/jsoup#1464</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: added support for Internationalized Domain Names (IDNs) in Jsoup.Connect.\n<a href=\"https://github.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/1300\">jhy/jsoup#1300</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: added support for loading and parsing gzipped HTML files in Jsoup.parse(File in, charset, baseUri).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: reduced thread contention in HttpConnection and Document.\n<a href=\"https://github.com/jhy/jsoup/pull/1455\">jhy/jsoup#1455</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: better parsing performance when under high thread concurrency\n<a href=\"https://github.com/jhy/jsoup/pull/1402\">jhy/jsoup#1402</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: added Element#id(String) ID attribute setter.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: in Document, #body() and #head() accessors will now automatically create those elements, if they were\nmissing (e.g. if the Document was not parsed from HTML). Additionally, the #body() method returns the frameset\nelement (instead of null) for frameset documents.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: when cleaning a document, the output settings of the original document are cloned into the cleaned\ndocument.\n<a href=\"https://github.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/1417\">jhy/jsoup#1417</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: when parsing XML, disable pretty-printing by default.\n<a href=\"https://github.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/1168\">jhy/jsoup#1168</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: much better performance in Node#clone() for large and deeply nested documents. Complexity was O(n^2) or\nworse, now O(n).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: during traversal using the NodeTraversor, nodes may now be replaced with Node#replaceWith(Node).\n<a href=\"https://github.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/1289\">jhy/jsoup#1289</a></p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n</blockquote>\n<p>...
