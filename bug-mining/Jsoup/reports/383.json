new `org.jsoup.select.Elements#set(int, Element)` method since 1.17.1 has an issue.\r\n\r\nthis call `old.replaceWith(element)` method, and this method calls `parentNode.replaceChild(this, in)`. in the `replaceChild` method, out's parentNode is removed  `out.parentNode = null;`. this may cause an null issue.\r\n\r\neg: a parent node has 5 child elements, if I replace the 3rd element twice, eg:
