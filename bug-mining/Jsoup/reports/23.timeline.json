That server is a bit weird. It looks like it defaults to sending gzipped output if you _don't_ give it an Accept and an Accept-Encoding. Which seems an odd choice.\n\nAt least it sends a Content-Encoding when it does encode as gzip. I wonder if this behavior is from geni.com or nginx.\n\nI'll look at supporting gzip responses. Have been planning on extending the URL connection support to include user-agent, cookies, headers etc.\n","author_association":"OWNER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jhy/jsoup/issues/comments/341713/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"jhy","id":76934,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc2OTM0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/76934?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy","html_url":"https://github.com/jhy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jhy/jsoup/issues/comments/365537","html_url":"https://github.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/28#issuecomment-365537","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jhy/jsoup/issues/28","id":365537,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM2NTUzNw==","user":{"login":"jhy","id":76934,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc2OTM0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/76934?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy","html_url":"https://github.com/jhy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2010-08-22T04:50:15Z","updated_at":"2010-08-22T04:50:15Z","body":"Added
