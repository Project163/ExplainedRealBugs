seems to be some weird behavior in version 1.17.1 when combining multiple nested attribute selectors.\r\n\r\nMinimal working example:\r\n\r\n```java\r\nDocument document = Jsoup.parse(\"\"\"\r\n    <div id=\"parent\">\r\n        <span class=\"child\"></span>\r\n        <span class=\"child\"></span>\r\n        <span class=\"child\"></span>\r\n    </div>\r\n\"\"\");\r\n\r\nSystem.out.println(document.select(\"[class*=\\\"child\\\"]\").size()); // 3\r\nSystem.out.println(document.select(\"#parent [class*=\\\"child\\\"]\").size()); // 3\r\nSystem.out.println(document.select(\"#parent [class*=\\\"child\\\"], .some-other-selector\").size()); // 3\r\nSystem.out.println(document.select(\"#parent [class*=\\\"child\\\"], .some-other-selector .nested\").size()); // 0\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe first three `select`s all correctly find 3 nodes, while the last one doesn't seem to find anything.\r\n\r\nThe code above works correctly (all four `select`s find 3 nodes) on version 1.16.2.\r\n\r\nTested on OpenJDK 11, 17 and
