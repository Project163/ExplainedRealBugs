changelog</a>.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>jsoup changelog</p>\n<p>*** Release 1.13.1 [PENDING]</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: memory optimizations, reducing the retained size of a Document by ~ 39%, and allocations by ~ 9%:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Attributes holder in Elements is only created if the element has attributes</li>\n<li>Only track the baseUri in an element when it is set via DOM to a new value for a given tree</li>\n<li>After parsing, do not retain the input character reader (and associated buffers) in the Document#parser</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: when pretty-printing, comments in inline tags are not pushed to a newline</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: added Attributes#hasDeclaredValueForKey(key) and Attribute#hasDeclaredValueForKeyIgnoreCase(), to check\nif an attribute is set but has no value. Useful in place of the deprecated and removed BooleanAttribute class and\ninstanceof test.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: removed old methods and classes that were marked deprecated in previous releases.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Bugfix: in a <select> tag, a second <optgroup> would not automatically close an earlier open <optgroup>\n<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/1313\">jhy/jsoup#1313</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Bugfix: in CharacterReader when parsing an input stream, could throw a Mark Invalid exception if the reader was\nmarked, a bufferUp occurred, and then the reader was rewound.\n<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/1324\">jhy/jsoup#1324</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Bugfix: empty tags and form tags did not have their attributes normalized (lower-cased by default)\n<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/jhy/jsoup/pull/1323\">jhy/jsoup#1323</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Bugfix: when preserve case was set to on, the HTML pretty-print formatter didn't indent capitalized tags correctly.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Bugfix: ensure that script and style contents are parsed into DataNodes, not TextNodes, when in case-sensitive\nparse mode.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>**** Release 1.12.2 [2020-Feb-08]</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: the :has() selector now supports relative selectors. For example, the query\n&quot;div:has(&gt; a)&quot; will select all &quot;div&quot; elements that have at least one direct child &quot;a&quot; element.\n<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/jhy/jsoup/pull/1214\">jhy/jsoup#1214</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: added Element chaining methods for various overridden methods on Node.\n<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/1193\">jhy/jsoup#1193</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: ensure HTTP keepalives work when fetching content via body() and bodyAsBytes().\n<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/1232\">jhy/jsoup#1232</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: set the default max body size in Jsoup.Connection to 2MB (up from 1MB) so fewer people get trimmed\ncontent if they have not set it, but still in sensible bounds. Also updated the default user-agent to improve\ndefault compatibility.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: dramatic speed improvement when bulk inserting child nodes into an element (wrapping contents).\n<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/1281\">jhy/jsoup#1281</a></p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</tr></table> ...

changelog</a>.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>jsoup changelog</p>\n<p>*** Release 1.13.1 [PENDING]</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: memory optimizations, reducing the retained size of a Document by ~ 39%, and allocations by ~ 9%:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Attributes holder in Elements is only created if the element has attributes</li>\n<li>Only track the baseUri in an element when it is set via DOM to a new value for a given tree</li>\n<li>After parsing, do not retain the input character reader (and associated buffers) in the Document#parser</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: when pretty-printing, comments in inline tags are not pushed to a newline</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: added Attributes#hasDeclaredValueForKey(key) and Attribute#hasDeclaredValueForKeyIgnoreCase(), to check\nif an attribute is set but has no value. Useful in place of the deprecated and removed BooleanAttribute class and\ninstanceof test.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: removed old methods and classes that were marked deprecated in previous releases.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Bugfix: in a <select> tag, a second <optgroup> would not automatically close an earlier open <optgroup>\n<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/1313\">jhy/jsoup#1313</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Bugfix: in CharacterReader when parsing an input stream, could throw a Mark Invalid exception if the reader was\nmarked, a bufferUp occurred, and then the reader was rewound.\n<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/1324\">jhy/jsoup#1324</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Bugfix: empty tags and form tags did not have their attributes normalized (lower-cased by default)\n<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/jhy/jsoup/pull/1323\">jhy/jsoup#1323</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Bugfix: when preserve case was set to on, the HTML pretty-print formatter didn't indent capitalized tags correctly.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Bugfix: ensure that script and style contents are parsed into DataNodes, not TextNodes, when in case-sensitive\nparse mode.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>**** Release 1.12.2 [2020-Feb-08]</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: the :has() selector now supports relative selectors. For example, the query\n&quot;div:has(&gt; a)&quot; will select all &quot;div&quot; elements that have at least one direct child &quot;a&quot; element.\n<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/jhy/jsoup/pull/1214\">jhy/jsoup#1214</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: added Element chaining methods for various overridden methods on Node.\n<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/1193\">jhy/jsoup#1193</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: ensure HTTP keepalives work when fetching content via body() and bodyAsBytes().\n<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/1232\">jhy/jsoup#1232</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: set the default max body size in Jsoup.Connection to 2MB (up from 1MB) so fewer people get trimmed\ncontent if they have not set it, but still in sensible bounds. Also updated the default user-agent to improve\ndefault compatibility.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: dramatic speed improvement when bulk inserting child nodes into an element (wrapping contents).\n<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/1281\">jhy/jsoup#1281</a></p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</tr></table> ...

changelog</a>.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>jsoup changelog</p>\n<p>*** Release 1.13.1 [PENDING]</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: memory optimizations, reducing the retained size of a Document by ~ 39%, and allocations by ~ 9%:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Attributes holder in Elements is only created if the element has attributes</li>\n<li>Only track the baseUri in an element when it is set via DOM to a new value for a given tree</li>\n<li>After parsing, do not retain the input character reader (and associated buffers) in the Document#parser</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: when pretty-printing, comments in inline tags are not pushed to a newline</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: added Attributes#hasDeclaredValueForKey(key) and Attribute#hasDeclaredValueForKeyIgnoreCase(), to check\nif an attribute is set but has no value. Useful in place of the deprecated and removed BooleanAttribute class and\ninstanceof test.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: removed old methods and classes that were marked deprecated in previous releases.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Bugfix: in a <select> tag, a second <optgroup> would not automatically close an earlier open <optgroup>\n<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/1313\">jhy/jsoup#1313</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Bugfix: in CharacterReader when parsing an input stream, could throw a Mark Invalid exception if the reader was\nmarked, a bufferUp occurred, and then the reader was rewound.\n<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/1324\">jhy/jsoup#1324</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Bugfix: empty tags and form tags did not have their attributes normalized (lower-cased by default)\n<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/jhy/jsoup/pull/1323\">jhy/jsoup#1323</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Bugfix: when preserve case was set to on, the HTML pretty-print formatter didn't indent capitalized tags correctly.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Bugfix: ensure that script and style contents are parsed into DataNodes, not TextNodes, when in case-sensitive\nparse mode.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>**** Release 1.12.2 [2020-Feb-08]</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: the :has() selector now supports relative selectors.

nearest element matching the\nselector.\n<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/1326\">jhy/jsoup#1326</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: memory optimizations, reducing the retained size of a Document by ~ 39%, and allocations by ~ 9%:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Attributes holder in Elements is only created if the element has attributes</li>\n<li>Only track the baseUri in an element when it is set via DOM to a new value for a given tree</li>\n<li>After parsing, do not retain the input character reader (and associated buffers) in the Document#parser</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: when pretty-printing, comments in inline tags are not pushed to a newline</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: added Attributes#hasDeclaredValueForKey(key) and Attribute#hasDeclaredValueForKeyIgnoreCase(), to check\nif an attribute is set but has no value. Useful in place of the deprecated and removed BooleanAttribute class and\ninstanceof test.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: removed old methods and classes that were marked deprecated in previous releases.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: added Element#select(Evaluator) and Element#selectFirst(Evaluator), to allow re-use of a parsed CSS\nselector if using the same evaluator many times.\n<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/1319\">jhy/jsoup#1319</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: added Elements#forms(), Elements#textNodes(), Elements#dataNodes(), and Elements#comments(), as a\nconvenient way to get access to these node types directly from an element selection.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Bugfix: in a <select> tag, a second <optgroup> would not automatically close an earlier open <optgroup>\n<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/1313\">jhy/jsoup#1313</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Bugfix: in CharacterReader when parsing an input stream, could throw a Mark Invalid exception if the reader was\nmarked, a bufferUp occurred, and then the reader was rewound.\n<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/1324\">jhy/jsoup#1324</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Bugfix: empty tags and form tags did not have their attributes normalized (lower-cased by default)\n<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/jhy/jsoup/pull/1323\">jhy/jsoup#1323</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Bugfix: when preserve case was set to on, the HTML pretty-print formatter didn't indent capitalized tags correctly.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Bugfix: ensure that script and style contents are parsed into DataNodes, not TextNodes, when in case-sensitive\nparse mode.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>**** Release 1.12.2 [2020-Feb-08]</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: the :has() selector now supports relative selectors. For example, the query\n&quot;div:has(&gt; a)&quot; will select all &quot;div&quot; elements that have at least one direct child &quot;a&quot; element.\n<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/jhy/jsoup/pull/1214\">jhy/jsoup#1214</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: added Element chaining methods for various overridden methods on Node.\n<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/1193\">jhy/jsoup#1193</a></p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</tr></table> ...

changelog</a>.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>jsoup changelog</p>\n<p>*** Release 1.13.1 [PENDING]</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: added Element#closest(selector), which walks up the tree to find the nearest element matching the\nselector.\n<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/1326\">jhy/jsoup#1326</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: memory optimizations, reducing the retained size of a Document by ~ 39%, and allocations by ~ 9%:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Attributes holder in Elements is only created if the element has attributes</li>\n<li>Only track the baseUri in an element when it is set via DOM to a new value for a given tree</li>\n<li>After parsing, do not retain the input character reader (and associated buffers) in the Document#parser</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: substantial parse speed improvements vs 1.12.x (bringing back to par with previous releases).\n<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/1327\">jhy/jsoup#1327</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: when pretty-printing, comments in inline tags are not pushed to a newline</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: added Attributes#hasDeclaredValueForKey(key) and Attribute#hasDeclaredValueForKeyIgnoreCase(), to check\nif an attribute is set but has no value. Useful in place of the deprecated and removed BooleanAttribute class and\ninstanceof test.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: removed old methods and classes that were marked deprecated in previous releases.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: added Element#select(Evaluator) and Element#selectFirst(Evaluator), to allow re-use of a parsed CSS\nselector if using the same evaluator many times.\n<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/1319\">jhy/jsoup#1319</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: added Elements#forms(), Elements#textNodes(), Elements#dataNodes(), and Elements#comments(), as a\nconvenient way to get access to these node types directly from an element selection.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: preserve whitespace before html and head tag, if pretty-printing is off.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Bugfix: in a <select> tag, a second <optgroup> would not automatically close an earlier open <optgroup>\n<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/1313\">jhy/jsoup#1313</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Bugfix: in CharacterReader when parsing an input stream, could throw a Mark Invalid exception if the reader was\nmarked, a bufferUp occurred, and then the reader was rewound.\n<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/1324\">jhy/jsoup#1324</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Bugfix: empty tags and form tags did not have their attributes normalized (lower-cased by default)\n<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/jhy/jsoup/pull/1323\">jhy/jsoup#1323</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Bugfix: when preserve case was set to on, the HTML pretty-print formatter didn't indent capitalized tags correctly.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Bugfix: ensure that script and style contents are parsed into DataNodes, not TextNodes, when in case-sensitive\nparse mode.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>**** Release 1.12.2 [2020-Feb-08]</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Improvement: the :has() selector now supports relative selectors. For example, the query</li>\n</ul>\n</tr></table> ...
