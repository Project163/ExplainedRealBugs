It's a ThreadLocal because a single Evaluator can be compiled and reused across multiple threads - in that case, if we just used a regular map, the cache would be contaminated by multiple threads / DOMs.\n\nIn your test case, it looks like you're spawning a new thread for each task. I would have expected each thread's ThreadLocalMap to be GCable once its execution completed, and so you wouldn't see growth like you are. But, it's not getting reaped; I need to dig a bit deeper to understand exactly why.\n\nBut at least one quick fix is to have the `eval.reset()` call once each eval is complete (vs only at the start, which is what we have now). \n\nI also want to look at using either an explicit SoftPool or a WeakHashMap for the cache so that it gets reaped when the DOM does.\n\nWith the former change, and tasks per thread set to 100, it runs to completion and gives:\n\n```text\nIteration 997/1000 - Task 996 (Thread: Thread-996) - Memory: 129 MB\nIteration 998/1000 - Task 997 (Thread: Thread-997) - Memory: 162 MB\nIteration 999/1000 - Task 998 (Thread: Thread-998) - Memory: 128 MB\nIteration 1000/1000 - Task 999 (Thread: Thread-999) - Memory: 163 MB\n\nTest completed in 101624 ms\nThreads used: 1000 out of 10\nThread names: [snip]\nInitial memory: 61 MB\nFinal memory: 163 MB\nMemory increase: 101 MB\n```\n\n(The test doesn't actually run multiple tasks per thread, or any concurrently; that doesn't really matter for this case of course. It does seem like the threads are being retained somewhere, I need to run under a profiler to understand a bit better.)","author_association":"OWNER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jhy/jsoup/issues/comments/3356066175/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"jhy","id":76934,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc2OTM0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/76934?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy","html_url":"https://github.com/jhy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jhy/jsoup/issues/comments/3356131426","html_url":"https://github.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/2411#issuecomment-3356131426","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jhy/jsoup/issues/2411","id":3356131426,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAAbAPs7ICoBi","user":{"login":"valodzka","id":9821,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk4MjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9821?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/valodzka","html_url":"https://github.com/valodzka","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/valodzka/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/valodzka/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/valodzka/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/valodzka/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/valodzka/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/valodzka/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/valodzka/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/valodzka/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/valodzka/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-10-01T12:43:42Z","updated_at":"2025-10-01T13:05:01Z","body":"> But at least one quick fix is to have the eval.reset() call once each eval is complete (vs only at the start, which is what we have now).\n\nbut reset() methods is protected, how can i call it?\n\n>  I would have expected each thread's ThreadLocalMap to be GCable once its execution completed\n\nYes, it GC-ed if Thread completed and unreachable.
