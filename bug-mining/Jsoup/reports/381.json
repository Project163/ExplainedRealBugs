Tokeniser logic for parsing attribute names considers a '<' character to be the end of the tag.

It will then process `<junk` as a new tag and associate the `after` attribute with it.\r\n\r\nHandling more consistently with browsers might assign the unvalued attribute `\"<junk\"` to the `a` tag and continue processing additional attributes.","closed_by":{"login":"jhy","id":76934,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc2OTM0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/76934?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy","html_url":"https://github.com/jhy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jhy/jsoup/issues/1483/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jhy/jsoup/issues/1483/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
