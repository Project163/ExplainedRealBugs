(I believe it's valid but meaningless HTML..)\r\n\r\n**Input**\r\n```\r\n<div =\"\">\r\n```\r\n\r\n[produces](https://try.jsoup.org/~d9Ak3YlzQMWLcWkuIc49e0_8N_4):\r\n\r\n**XML**\r\n```xml\r\n<div =\"\"=\"\"></div>\r\n```\r\n\r\n**HTML**\r\n```html\r\n<div =\"\"></div>\r\n```\r\n\r\nNeed to inspect the nodes directly for XML as I'm not sure what is happening there. The HTML at least looks valid.\r\n\r\nThe expected outcome of the XML output syntax is that an XML parser can read it - so probably we need to apply the same validations as in the W3CDom convertor. Specifically, the tag name and attribute validators.\r\n\r\nFor HTML it seems syntactically valid, but maybe a better idea that we just drop attributes with no key and no value -- what could be the point of retaining them? If they have a value though, should we keep an empty name? Happy to hear from people on this.","closed_by":{"login":"jhy","id":76934,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc2OTM0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/76934?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy","html_url":"https://github.com/jhy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jhy/jsoup/issues/1474/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jhy/jsoup/issues/1474/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
