We are passing in a URL of the form: http://xxx/api/123+456. The URLBuilder decodes the URL path:\r\n`URI uri = new URI(..., decodePart(this.u.getPath()), ...);`\r\n\r\nwhich yields: `http://xxx/api/123 456`\r\n\r\nThat is, the plus sign is converted to a space.\r\n\r\nAfaik, plus signs in a path shouldn't be encoded (see for example https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2678551/when-should-space-be-encoded-to-plus-or-20 and https://www.baeldung.com/java-url-encoding-decoding).\r\n\r\nIn 1.15.3 the plus sign wasn't decoded to a space and the URL still works fine.\r\nAlso, encoding the plus sign as %2B works as the decoding will decode it to a plus sign.

solution.)","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jhy/jsoup/issues/comments/1582330644/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"ntinnemeier","id":44636519,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0NjM2NTE5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/44636519?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ntinnemeier","html_url":"https://github.com/ntinnemeier","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ntinnemeier/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ntinnemeier/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ntinnemeier/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ntinnemeier/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ntinnemeier/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ntinnemeier/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ntinnemeier/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ntinnemeier/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ntinnemeier/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":10312775897,"node_id":"AE_lADOAAbAPs5lUFrGzwAAAAJmsHjZ","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jhy/jsoup/issues/events/10312775897","actor":{"login":"jhy","id":76934,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc2OTM0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/76934?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy","html_url":"https://github.com/jhy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"assigned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2023-09-08T01:00:44Z","assignee":{"login":"jhy","id":76934,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc2OTM0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/76934?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy","html_url":"https://github.com/jhy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":10312776377,"node_id":"LE_lADOAAbAPs5lUFrGzwAAAAJmsHq5","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jhy/jsoup/issues/events/10312776377","actor":{"login":"jhy","id":76934,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc2OTM0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/76934?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy","html_url":"https://github.com/jhy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2023-09-08T01:00:49Z","label":{"name":"bug","color":"e10c02"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":10312776382,"node_id":"LE_lADOAAbAPs5lUFrGzwAAAAJmsHq-","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jhy/jsoup/issues/events/10312776382","actor":{"login":"jhy","id":76934,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc2OTM0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/76934?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy","html_url":"https://github.com/jhy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/gists{/gist_id}","starred
