pretty-printing, newlines and trailing spaces could be better handled.\r\n\r\nTwo cases as examples:\r\n\r\n```\r\n<div>\r\n·Text\r\n</div>\r\n```\r\n\r\n(with `·` representing a space), is currently emitted as:\r\n\r\n```\r\n<div>\r\n··Text·\r\n</div>\r\n```\r\n\r\nAs the textnode value is \"·Text\\n\", and then when pre-printing, that gets indented (now two leading spaces but should only be one if the indent level is set to one); and then the trailing newline gets normalized to a space.\r\n\r\nSimilarly,\r\n\r\n```\r\n<div>\r\n <p>One\r\n <p>Two\r\n</div>\r\n```\r\n\r\nGets emitted
