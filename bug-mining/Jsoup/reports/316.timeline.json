for reporting this, fixed!\r\n\r\nThe issue wasn't about self-closing tags so much as a problem with case normalization. The tail hit ([here](https://github.com/jhy/jsoup/commit/94af4ec25ded5c74b4a5748d59378fb955b5ecc1#diff-914052de02ea0f549cbdaf7ee06076edce76c1644e09381fc9564f702aa370a0R168) - line 168) was testing against the nodename not the normalname. The head was already using the normalname. This difference had no impact in earlier versions of jsoup because through this cleaner path, the parsed tags would all be lowercased. But now with SVG foreign elements preserving case, the bug manifested.\r\n\r\nFixed by using the normalname, and also ensuring that the input to the safelist is normalized.\r\n\r\nSimilarly for attribute names - the input names were not normalized and so by adding lower-cased versions of the attributes, they were removed from the output.\r\n\r\nI also noticed an issue that the self-closing style of the input for tags was not preserved in the output - have fixed that too.\r\n\r\nThe actual output is now:\r\n\r\n```svg\r\n<svg width=\"200\" height=\"200\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">\r\n <filter id=\"feOffset\" x=\"-40\" y=\"-20\" width=\"100\" height=\"200\">\r\n  <feOffset in=\"SourceGraphic\" dx=\"60\" dy=\"60\" />\r\n  <feGaussianBlur in=\"SourceGraphic\" stdDeviation=\"5\" result=\"blur2\" />\r\n  <feMerge>\r\n   <feMergeNode in=\"blur2\" />\r\n   <feMergeNode />\r\n   <feMergeNode in=\"SourceGraphic\" />\r\n  </feMerge>\r\n </filter> <filter id=\"noise2\" x=\"0\" y=\"0\" width=\"100%\" height=\"100%\">\r\n  <feTurbulence baseFrequency=\"0.05\" />\r\n </filter> <clipPath id=\"myClip2\" clipPathUnits=\"objectBoundingBox\">\r\n  <circle cx=\".5\" cy=\".5\" r=\".35\" />\r\n </clipPath> <filter id=\"convolveMatrix2\" x=\"0\" y=\"0\" width=\"100%\" height=\"100%\">\r\n  <feConvolveMatrix kernelMatrix=\"-1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1\" />\r\n </filter> <rect x=\"40\" y=\"40\" width=\"100\" height=\"100\" style=\"stroke: #000000; fill: green; filter: url(#feOffset);\" /> <rect x=\"40\" y=\"40\" width=\"100\" height=\"100\" style=\"stroke: #000000; fill: green;\" />\r\n</svg>\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhich renders correctly.\r\n\r\nAs a feature thought - I wonder if it would be useful to include an `enforceCase` option in the cleaner, which would enforce the case of tags and elements as they are set in the safelist? That way one could normalize to a specific case. Possibly also useful for XML cleaning (though we need to update the Cleaner to support full documents, not just the body fragment, for that to be more useful).","author_association":"OWNER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jhy/jsoup/issues/comments/1823682274/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"jhy","id":76934,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc2OTM0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/76934?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy","html_url":"https://github.com/jhy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jhy/jsoup/issues/comments/1827563097","html_url":"https://github.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/2049#issuecomment-1827563097","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jhy/jsoup/issues/2049","id":1827563097,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAAbAPs5s7mZZ","user":{"login":"Balf","id":1479618,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0Nzk2MTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1479618?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Balf","html_url":"https://github.com/Balf","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Balf/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Balf/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Balf/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Balf/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Balf/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Balf/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Balf/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Balf/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Balf/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-11-27T10:30:25Z","updated_at":"2023-11-27T10:30:25Z","body":"@jhy Thank you!
