Unfortunately, access to the enforced attributes is `default` i.e., accessible only from the same package. So, no dice. Still need to copy the class :-(\r\n\r\nAnother thing that bugs me: All methods to create or modify `Safelist`s are `public` - only when you want to use it, that is all hidden away.\r\n\r\nSo, while my use case might be rather specific, it would allow re-use of the `Safelist` class, if those three (`#isTagSafe(), #isAttributeSafe(), #getEnforcedAttributes()`) methods would be accessible. It would allow to implement custom checkers and cleaners.","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jhy/jsoup/issues/comments/1609597799/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"snak3b1te","id":67116253,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY3MTE2MjUz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/67116253?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/snak3b1te","html_url":"https://github.com/snak3b1te","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/snak3b1te/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/snak3b1te/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/snak3b1te/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/snak3b1te/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/snak3b1te/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/snak3b1te/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/snak3b1te/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/snak3b1te/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/snak3b1te/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":9652884781,"node_id":"MEE_lADOAAbAPs5KfdmtzwAAAAI_W1Ut","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jhy/jsoup/issues/events/9652884781","actor":{"login":"jhy","id":76934,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc2OTM0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/76934?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy","html_url":"https://github.com/jhy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2023-06-27T14:15:20Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":9652884800,"node_id":"SE_lADOAAbAPs5KfdmtzwAAAAI_W1VA","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jhy/jsoup/issues/events/9652884800","actor":{"login":"jhy","id":76934,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc2OTM0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/76934?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy","html_url":"https://github.com/jhy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2023-06-27T14:15:20Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":10686086334,"node_id":"CE_lADOAAbAPs5KfdmtzwAAAAJ88Ly-","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jhy/jsoup/issues/events/10686086334","actor":{"login":"jhy","id":76934,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc2OTM0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/76934?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy","html_url":"https://github.com/jhy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":"8a597925a7dae0b3bce86b1b5638699abed72331","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jhy/jsoup/commits/8a597925a7dae0b3bce86b1b5638699abed72331","created_at":"2023-10-18T02:18:41Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":10686086693,"node_id":"MIE_lADOAAbAPs5KfdmtzwAAAAJ88L4l","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jhy/jsoup/issues/events/10686086693","actor":{"login":"jhy","id":76934,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc2OTM0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.gi
