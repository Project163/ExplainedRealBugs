The code is super-clean and works wonderfully!\n\nPublic method Node#outerHtml() constructs a 32KB buffer in 1.6.1. This is excessive for use case scenarios like ours: we are constructing small HTML fragments in memory and serializing them immediately. Output size is known to not exceed 100 or 200 characters most of the time.\n\nNode#outerHtml(StringBuilder accum) is not public. Calling Element#html() - which doesn't preallocate memory - on a temporary outer node seems to be the only workaround solution right now.\n\nA fix should be simple. Thank you!\n\nGeorge Nikolaidis / Ergobyte (www.ergobyte.gr)\n","closed_by":{"login":"jhy","id":76934,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc2OTM0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/76934?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy","html_url":"https://github.com/jhy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jhy/jsoup/issues/143/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jhy/jsoup/issues/143/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
