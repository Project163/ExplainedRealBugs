// there are 2 spaces between the words\r\n    System.out.println(tn.toString()); // prints string with 2 spaces\r\n    tn.setParentNode(...); // set any parent\r\n    System.out.println(tn.toString()); // prints string with 1 space\r\n    ...\r\n\r\nFrom my point of view the expected behaviour is that a single TextNode without parent behaves like a \"typical\" TextNode.\r\nAnd the typical behaviour in jsoup is, that whitespace is normalized (the default value in out.prettyPrint() is true).\r\n\r\nYou may find a running example in the attached source file.\r\n\r\n--\r\nMy recommendation:\r\nIn the method  TextNode.outerHtmlHead(...)\r\njust remove the \"instance of\" check, since preserveWhitespace(..) already checks for instanceof Element and represents the expected standard behaviour in the case that this check fails:\r\n\r\n    ...\r\n    boolean normaliseWhite = out.prettyPrint() && parent() instanceof Element && !Element.preserveWhitespace(parent());\r\n    ...\r\n\r\nshould become\r\n\r\n    ...\r\n    boolean normaliseWhite = out.prettyPrint() && !Element.preserveWhitespace(parent());\r\n    ...\r\n\r\nBest Regards\r\nMr-Mr-X\r\n[JsoupBugExample.zip](https://github.com/jhy/jsoup/files/4128101/JsoupBugExample.zip)\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"jhy","id":76934,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc2OTM0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/76934?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy","html_url":"https://github.com/jhy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jhy/jsoup/issues/1309/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jhy/jsoup/issues/1309/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
