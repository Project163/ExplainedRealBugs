But it's not.\r\n\r\nI'm using `org.jsoup:jsoup:1.15.3` with Java 17. I have a test HTML document that looks something like this:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<!DOCTYPE html>\r\n<html>\r\n<head>\r\n  <meta charset=\"utf-8\">\r\n  <title>Foobar</title\r\n</head>\r\n<body>\r\n  …\r\n</body>\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn a JUnit 5/Hamcrest unit test I read that document:\r\n\r\n```java\r\nURL testResourceUrl = getClass().getResource(\"foobar.html\");\r\ntry (InputStream inputStream = testResourceUrl.openStream()) {\r\n  org.jsoup.nodes.Document jsoupDocument = Jsoup.parse(inputStream, null, testResourceUrl.toString());\r\n  org.w3c.dom.Document domDocument = new W3CDom().fromJsoup(jsoupDocument);\r\n  assertThat(domDocument.getDocumentElement().getNamespaceURI(), is(\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\"));\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nUnfortunately this test fails:\r\n\r\n```\r\njava.lang.AssertionError: \r\nExpected: is \"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\"\r\n     but: was null\r\n…\r\n```\r\n\r\nThus jsoup has a bug: it is not following the HTML5 specification and placing HTML elements in the `http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml` namespace, but instead assigning them the `null` namespace.\r\n\r\nTo reiterate, yes, I realize that the HTML document in question has no default namespace specified. But as an HTML document it isn't required or even expected to. The HTML5 specification says that the HTML elements should be placed in the `http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml` regardless.","closed_by":{"login":"jhy","id":76934,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc2OTM0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/76934?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy","html_url":"https://github.com/jhy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jhy/jsoup/issues/1837/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jhy/jsoup/issues/1837/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
