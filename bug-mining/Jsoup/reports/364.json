MDN says that `template` is allowed inside every element that accepts phrasing content and buttons accept phrasing content.\n\nI also put that snippet through https://validator.w3.org which passed:\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d1d0cfb7-3aa8-40a9-bb22-eda19e65f4c7)\n\nStill it doesn't get parsed correctly. I added a test to `HtmlParserTest`. The test currently passes that way, which is incorrect:\n\n```java\n    @Test void templateInButton() {\n        String html = \"<button> <template><button></button></template> </button>\";\n        Document doc = Jsoup.parse(html);\n        assertEquals(\"<button><template></template></button><button></button>\",\n                TextUtil.stripNewlines(doc.body().html()));\n    }\n```\n\nWe can see that the inner button ends up being interpreted as a sibling of the outer button.","closed_by":{"login":"jhy","id":76934,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc2OTM0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/76934?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy","html_url":"https://github.com/jhy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jhy/jsoup/issues/2271/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jhy/jsoup/issues/2271/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
