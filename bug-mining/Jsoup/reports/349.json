want to parse my doc and read the attribute range, I had read the doc and the issue #1114. I found some time, the `org.jsoup.nodes.Attribute#sourceRange` return null. After test, I found if body tag is preceded by some tags, like p, span the `org.jsoup.nodes.Attribute#sourceRange` will return null，otherwise, it works normally. I don't know if this is a bug, is there some way to recognize it and get the range of attr?\r\n\r\n- my code:\r\n```import org.jsoup.Jsoup;\r\nimport org.jsoup.nodes.Attribute;\r\nimport org.jsoup.nodes.Document;\r\nimport org.jsoup.nodes.Element;\r\nimport org.jsoup.parser.Parser;\r\n\r\nimport java.io.FileInputStream;\r\n\r\npublic class TestMain {\r\n    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception{\r\n        FileInputStream fis = new FileInputStream(\"tmp.html\");\r\n        String text = new String(fis.readAllBytes());\r\n        Parser parser = org.jsoup.parser.Parser.htmlParser();\r\n        parser.setTrackPosition(true);\r\n        Document doc = Jsoup.parse(text,parser);\r\n        for (Element element : doc.getAllElements()){\r\n            Attribute targetAttr = element.attribute(\"target\");\r\n            if (targetAttr !=  null){\r\n                System.out.println(targetAttr.sourceRange());\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n- tmp.html\r\n\r\n```\r\n<!DOCTYPE html>\r\n<head></head>\r\n<span></span>\r\n<body target=\"text\">\r\n</body>\r\n</html>\r\n```\r\n\r\n- result\r\n```\r\n-1,-1:-1--1,-1:-1=-1,-1:-1--1,-1:-1\r\n```\r\n\r\n- tmp.html\r\n```\r\n<!DOCTYPE html>\r\n<head></head>\r\n<body target=\"text\">\r\n</body>\r\n</html>\r\n```\r\n- result（expect result）\r\n```\r\n3,7:38-3,13:44=3,15:46-3,19:50\r\n```","closed_by":{"login":"jhy","id":76934,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc2OTM0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/76934?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy","html_url":"https://github.com/jhy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jhy/jsoup/issues/2204/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jhy/jsoup/issues/2204/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
