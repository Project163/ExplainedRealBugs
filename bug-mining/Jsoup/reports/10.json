It will not select `td` elements from any nested tables.\n\nWith JSoup, this would be something like:\n\n```\nElements tableRows = doc.select( \"table.data>tbody>tr\" );\nfor ( Element tr : tableRows )\n{\n    // do something with tr here\n    tr.select(\">td\");\n}\n```\n\nI currently get this error: `Could not parse query >td`\n","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jhy/jsoup/issues/13/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jhy/jsoup/issues/13/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
