I looked at a few different large HTML files and see it at around 3%. Specifically for the [Tartan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tartan) page on Wikipedia (1.8MB), looking at the flattened method list in YourKit in CPU Sampling mode, gives:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1133\" alt=\"inbuttonscope\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/92a1967c-63b4-4cec-8233-7e2de12f5fcd\" />\r\n\r\nDo you have a specific page as an example we can review?\r\n\r\nI won't just remove the function as it is a key goal of jsoup to parse to HTML5 compliance. If it is an actual hotspot that we can improve perf on, I am certainly keen to look at that. As you noted, you can avoid the entire HTML5 tree parsing rules by just using the simpler XML parser.\r\n\r\nOne thought I have had previously for the Parser is to use a different data structure than a simple ArrayList to maintain the stack of open elements. One that would allow an O(1) lookup to see if a given element by name is on the stack, and if so, where. Or at least something better than the current O(n) scan. E.g. perhaps an ancillary HashMap with a name -> list index.\r\n\r\nOn your second question WRT `select()` performance. Can you provide the example HTML and selector? I can take a look under a profiler and see if there are improvements to be had. And of course would welcome suggestions. I don't have an offhand view on why you may see a performance decrease; perhaps you could run a binary change comparison and narrow down the change range.\r\n","author_association":"OWNER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jhy/jsoup/issues/comments/2568400269/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"jhy","id":76934,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc2OTM0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/76934?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy","html_url":"https://github.com/jhy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jhy/jsoup/issues/comments/2568644557","html_url":"https://github.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/2254#issuecomment-2568644557","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jhy/jsoup/issues/2254","id":2568644557,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAAbAPs6ZGmfN","user":{"login":"saselovejulie","id":13128637,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMTI4NjM3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13128637?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/saselovejulie","html_url":"https://github.com/saselovejulie","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/saselovejulie/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/saselovejulie/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/saselovejulie/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/saselovejulie/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/saselovejulie/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/saselovejulie/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/saselovejulie/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/saselovejulie/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/saselovejulie/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-01-03T03:17:17Z","updated_at":"2025-01-03T05:14:08Z","body":"@jhy

that `select` difference is very interesting. I compared each main version between 1.13.x to now and see a very large impact for that query on that doc:\r\n\r\nMeasurements via JMH operations per second; `-f 1 -wi 2 -i 3`\r\n\r\nVersion | Parse ops | ± | Select ops | ± | Notes\r\n-- | -- | -- | -- | -- | --\r\n1.13.1 | 106 | 6 | 2548 | 123 |  \r\n1.14.3 | 109 | 6 | 2506 | 34 |  \r\n1.15.2 | 108 | 6 | 2102 | 146 |  \r\n1.16.1 | 110 | 8 | 2295 | 11\r\n1.16.2 | 108 | 7 | 320 | 3475 | Huge variance in select its; 537, 240, 181\r\n1.17.2 | 108 | 6 | 441 | 5 | No variance, but significant drop\r\n1.18.3 | 110 | 8 | 536 | 154 |  \r\n1.19.1* | 110 | 6 | 493 | 1180 | High variance; 530, 530, 418\r\n\r\nWill need to dig deeper to understand what's happening here. Off the top of my head the main changes in the Selector in that period have been:\r\n1. introducing a cost-based query order planner -- which should have some improvement on this query as it would run the ID evaluator before the descendant class evaluator (previous was always rightmost first).\r\n2. migrating the Collector to use a Java Stream vs explicit List add. Would not expect a substantial perf impact\r\n3. Change to the node traversor impl? But would not expect a change.\r\n\r\nBoth the step change and the new variance is quite unexpected here.

What Java env and what platform are you on? These runs are on a Mac M4 on JDK 21 (Server). \r\n2. The selector you provided doesn't actually match anything. There is no `id=res` in the tree that I can see. Is that what you expect / is that your actual query? I wonder if that empty result is part of the issue here. Perhaps the zero result was better optimized earlier.\r\n\r\n(Edit)\r\nFound (and added above) that the specific version change with most impact is `1.16.1` -> [`1.16.2`](https://jsoup.org/news/release-1.16.2), which is the version that introduced the evaluator reordering.
