http://try.jsoup.org/~lJwWpjXYUSTBeBZhdEnS3Mt56g4 will produce:\r\n```html\r\n    <html>\r\n     <head> \r\n      <style></style>\r\n     </head>\r\n     <body>\r\n       &lt;/head&gt; &lt;body&gt; &lt;p&gt;Whatever&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/body&gt; &lt;/html&gt;\r\n     </body>\r\n    </html>\r\n```\r\n\r\nWith `<title/>` instead of `<style/>`, the result is different but still wrong

source](https://github.com/jhy/jsoup/blob/master/src/main/java/org/jsoup/parser/HtmlTreeBuilderState.java#L106), it seems only the HtmlTreeBuilderState handling for `<noframes>`, `<style>` and `<title>` in the methods `handleRawText` and `handleRcData` doesn't get along with the self-closing tags.\r\nAny other tagname I've checked (and I tried to cover all branches of that `case StartTag` switch) results in a good parse similar to the `<script>` case, which is what I'd expect.\r\n\r\nThanks for looking into this!\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jhy/jsoup/issues/906/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jhy/jsoup/issues/906/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
