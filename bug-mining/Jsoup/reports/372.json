1.17.1 the array method of the Elements class will update the DOM, this behavior is not what I expected and could potentially cause some problems (e.g. accidentally breaking the DOM).\r\n\r\nTo be honest, I don't think modifying arrays should update the DOM, this behavior seems counter-intuitive to me.\r\n\r\nIf this cannot be changed back, I suggest adding an ElementList class, which is equivalent to the previous Elements class.\r\nThe inheritance could be ArrayList<Element> -> ElementList -> Elements.\r\nThe two classes provide a method to convert between them.","closed_by":{"login":"jhy","id":76934,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc2OTM0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/76934?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy","html_url":"https://github.com/jhy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jhy/jsoup/issues/2100/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jhy/jsoup/issues/2100/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
