It corresponds to an image linked elsewhere in MIME say like this\n\n--mimebounday\nContent-ID:<SDOMSDOFMOSDOMFOSD>\nContent-Type: image/jpeg.....\n(snip)\n\nSo, to mark a long story somewhat shorter, I use Jsoup's sanitizer extensively. However, I need these CID references to be preserved post sanitization. addProtocols does not work because the items are not valid URLs. As a result\nthe above becomes <img />. Which for my purposes is not good :)\n","closed_by":{"login":"jhy","id":76934,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc2OTM0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/76934?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy","html_url":"https://github.com/jhy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jhy/jsoup/issues/127/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jhy/jsoup/issues/127/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
