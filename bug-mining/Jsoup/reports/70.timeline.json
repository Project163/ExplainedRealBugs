The issue was that because `<xxxxx>` and `<src-lang...>` tags were never closed, the stack was massively deep (up to around 19K). (In practice for normal HTML the stack depth rarely exceeds 10.)\n\nWhere it went wrong was during the formatting adoption agency, which re-applies unclosed formatting tags (`<a>`), which also weren't closed in this input. It walks up the stack looking for matching elements, but because the stack was so deep and this path isn't optimized for that size, it was just burning the CPU.\n\nI've fixed it by limiting the scan to the bottom 64 elements, which in practice should be enough for anybody.

seconds).\n","author_association":"OWNER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jhy/jsoup/issues/comments/11694179/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"jhy","id":76934,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc2OTM0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/76934?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy","html_url":"https://github.com/jhy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"actor":{"login":"david-cliqz","id":5450515,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0NTA1MTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5450515?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/david-cliqz","html_url":"https://github.com/david-cliqz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/david-cliqz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/david-cliqz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/david-cliqz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/david-cliqz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/david-cliqz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/david-cliqz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/david-cliqz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/david-cliqz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/david-cliqz/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-06-18T12:44:30Z","updated_at":"2014-06-18T12:44:30Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/david-cliqz/goose/issues/10","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/david-cliqz/goose","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/david-cliqz/goose/issues/10/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/david-cliqz/goose/issues/10/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/david-cliqz/goose/issues/10/events","html_url":"https://github.com/david-cliqz/goose/issues/10","id":35980562,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWUzNTk4MDU2Mg==","number":10,"title":"Upgrade
