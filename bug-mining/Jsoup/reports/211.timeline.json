@jhy , there is a similar bug at https://github.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/729.

I guess the parser was misled by the blank between `> .foo,` and `> .bar` in the last line of the test example provided by https://github.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/729  and didn't behave normally. \r\n\r\nCould you please check that?
