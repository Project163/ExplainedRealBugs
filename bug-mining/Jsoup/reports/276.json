I appreciate the work that went into it!\r\n\r\nI've found a circumstance which tripped me up.  I was using the :contains(With  Text)\r\n\r\n(that's 2 spaces between \"With\" and \"Text\".  The raw HTML has the text this way.  But it seems JSoup matches on the normalized text.  If this is the expected behavior maybe just add a note to the documentation on it?  Thanks.  Or even better... can we use quotes to force matching against the un-normalized text?  I suppose it might be confusing if  :contains(With  Text) and  :contains(\"With  Text\") were different.","closed_by":{"login":"jhy","id":76934,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc2OTM0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/76934?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy","html_url":"https://github.com/jhy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jhy/jsoup/issues/876/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jhy/jsoup/issues/876/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
