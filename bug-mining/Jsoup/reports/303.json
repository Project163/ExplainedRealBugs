noticed an issue with how thread interruption handling is managed. I couldn't find any mention of this behaviour in the docs, and I'm not sure whether it's expected.\r\n\r\nJsoup appears to clear the interruption flag of the calling thread during I/O operations, which, I believe, leads to unexpected behaviour when trying to manage thread interruption.\r\n\r\nConsider the following client code:\r\n```Java\r\npublic void runWhileNotInterrupted() throws InterruptedException {\r\n    final ArrayList<String> bodies = new ArrayList<>();\r\n    Thread runner = new Thread(() -> {\r\n        try {\r\n            int i = 1;\r\n            while (!Thread.currentThread().isInterrupted()) {\r\n                Connection.Response res = Jsoup.connect(\"https://github.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/\" + i).execute();\r\n                bodies.add(res.body());\r\n                i += 1;\r\n            }\r\n        } catch (IOException e) {\r\n            throw new RuntimeException(e);\r\n        }\r\n    });\r\n\r\n    runner.start();\r\n    Thread.sleep(3 * 1000);\r\n    runner.interrupt(); // Jsoup clears the flag\r\n    runner.join(); // Thread never completes\r\n    System.out.println(bodies);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe interruption flag is being cleared through `java.lang.Thread#interrupted` in `ConstrainableInputStream.java`:\r\nhttps://github.com/jhy/jsoup/blob/1762412a28fa7b08ccf71d93fc4c98dc73086e03/src/main/java/org/jsoup/internal/ConstrainableInputStream.java#L49-L56\r\n\r\nI would expect either the interruption flag to be preserved or `java.lang.InterruptedException` to be thrown by Jsoup.\r\n\r\nPlease let me know if that behaviour is indeed unexpected. I will try to come up with a suitable solution and open a PR.
