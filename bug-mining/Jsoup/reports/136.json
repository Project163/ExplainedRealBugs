code:\r\n\r\n    Elements as = doc.select(\"a\");\r\n    for (Element e : as) {\r\n        if (e.classNames().size() > 0)\r\n            M.debug(e.classNames());\r\n

Attached is a sample input, and below is some simple code to run it (I am able to reproduce this problem consistently by reading from the file):\r\n\r\n\r\n        try {\r\n            Document doc = Jsoup.parse(new File(\"blahblah.txt\"), \"UTF-8\");\r\n            System.out.println(doc.html());\r\n            System.out.println(\"FINAL\");\r\n            System.out.println(doc.select(\".bigChar\"));\r\n            System.exit(0);\r\n        } catch (IOException e) {\r\n            e.printStackTrace();\r\n        }\r\n\r\n[blahblah.txt](https://github.com/jhy/jsoup/files/785471/blahblah.txt)\r\n\r\nYou can see in the HTML output that the \"bigChar\" class is used, but the .bigChar selector doesn't seem to find it.\r\n\r\nIn my run of the above code, my output is \r\n\r\n```\r\n   </div> \r\n   <script type=\"text/javascript\">\r\n         $('#footer').css('top', $(document).height() - $('#containerRoot').height());\r\n     </script>   \r\n  </body>\r\n </html>\r\n FINAL\r\n \r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n(i.e. nothing found for .bigChar)","closed_by":{"login":"jhy","id":76934,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc2OTM0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/76934?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy","html_url":"https://github.com/jhy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jhy/jsoup/issues/830/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jhy/jsoup/issues/830/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
