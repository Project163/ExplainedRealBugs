This is detected by another part of my program and jsoup previously accepted the null stream. In `org.jsoup.helper.DataUtil.parseInputStream(ControllableInputStream, String, String, Parser)` it simply returned `new Document(baseUri)`.\r\n\r\nWith one of the recent changes you wrap a `ControllableInputStream.wrap` around the stream object. Therefore the check \r\n```\r\nif (input == null) // empty body // todo reconsider?\r\n  return new Document(baseUri);\r\n```\r\nat the top of `org.jsoup.helper.DataUtil.parseInputStream(ControllableInputStream, String, String, Parser)` will never return a new `Document` when the stream is null. Instead it crashes when detecting the charset using `detectCharset` from the null stream. This seems to be wrong.\r\n\r\nSince null as a stream is supported (see @Nullable in the declaration of `parseInputStream`, I would add this @Nullable to `org.jsoup.helper.DataUtil.load(InputStream, String, String)` too.\r\n\r\nSolution (not tested):\r\nI would return null in `ControllableInputStream.wrap` if the stream is null.","closed_by":{"login":"jhy","id":76934,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc2OTM0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/76934?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy","html_url":"https://github.com/jhy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jhy/jsoup/issues/2252/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jhy/jsoup/issues/2252/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
