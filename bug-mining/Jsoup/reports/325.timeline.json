are seeing a difference in parser behaviour between 1.11.3, 1.15.4 and 1.16.1-SNAPSHOT with respect to whitespace and newlines between the html tags and text. We are using xml parser and prettyprint set to true.\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\nInput: \r\n\r\n```\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"freetext\"\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tid=\"text1\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1111\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div align = \"left\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<b>V2</b><br />\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<br />\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tXdxux<br />\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tv3yfygygyg\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\r\n```\r\n with Jsoup version 1.11.3 we get the parser output has\r\n```\r\n       <div class=\"freetext\" id=\"text1\">\r\n         1111 \r\n        <div align=\"left\"> \r\n         <b>V2</b>\r\n         <br /> \r\n         <br /> Xdxux\r\n         <br /> v3yfygygyg \r\n        </div> \r\n       </div> \r\n```\r\nwith Jsoup version 1.15.4 we get the parser output has\r\n```\r\n       <div class=\"freetext\" id=\"text1\">\r\n        1111 \r\n        <div align=\"left\"><b>V2</b><br /><br />\r\n          Xdxux<br />\r\n          v3yfygygyg\r\n        </div>\r\n       </div>\r\n```\r\nWe can re-create this issue using: https://try.jsoup.org/~HLY5GwlDvfC8Fn8tiGSpgCyIFFo\r\n\r\nI observed that some fixes was done around whitespace and newline character so I consumed 1.16.1-snapshot version.\r\n\r\nwith Jsoup version 1.16.1-snapshot version  we get the parser output has\r\n```\r\n       <div class=\"freetext\" id=\"text1\">\r\n        1111 \r\n        <div align=\"left\">\r\n         <b>V2</b>\r\n         <br />\r\n         <br />\r\n          Xdxux\r\n         <br />\r\n          v3yfygygyg\r\n        </div>\r\n       </div>\r\n``` \r\nWe are bit confused about which is the correct behaviour as we are upgrading the jsoup version from 1.11.3 to 1.15.4 \r\nto understand the difference I have highlighted it in the image below which was captured using notepad++ to showcase the difference in whitespace between various versions of jsoup \r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/31985625/223972467-6c2b17a3-5653-448b-b1dc-648a055b8475.png)\r\n\r\nIn 1.11.3 we see only `<div>` tag, but with 1.15.4 newline between `<div>` and `<b>` tag is lost.\r\n\r\nWith 1.11.3 we see there is a whitespace after every `<br />` and after the text \"v3yfygygyg\" but with 1.15.4 and 1.16.1-SNAPSHOT the whitespace is not there.\r\n\r\nwith 1.11.3 we see there is a whitespace after `<div align=\"left\">` which is not present with 1.15.4 and 1.16.1-SNAPSHOT version of jsoup\r\n\r\nwith 1.11.3 we see there is a whitespace after `</div>` tag which is not present with 1.15.4 and 1.16.1-SNAPSHOT version of jsoup\r\n\r\n@jhy  We are bit confused with what is the correct behaviour of the parser. Was there an issue with 1.11.3 which is fixed now or is this a new issue? Please can you let us know what should be the correct behaviour.\r\n\r\nThank you....","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jhy/jsoup/issues/1913/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jhy/jsoup/issues/1913/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":12850921477,"node_id":"REFE_lADOAAbAPs5h-JE2zwAAAAL9-YAF","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jhy/jsoup/issues/events/12850921477","actor":{"login":"royt93","id":13247132,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMjQ3MTMy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13247132?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/royt93","html_url":"https://github.com/royt93","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/royt93/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/royt93/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/royt93/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/royt93/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/royt93/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/royt93/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/royt93/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/royt93/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/royt93/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"8e2b86839b276191cf215a3500c405b1489cb215","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/royt93/lib_jsoup/commits/8e2b86839b276191cf215a3500c405b1489cb215","created_at":"2024-05-17T16:29:37Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
