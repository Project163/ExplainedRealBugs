added a note to clarify this behavior when using the HttpUrlConnection implementation.\n\nIdeally the way it would behave would be to have the connect timeout be the provided timeout, and then vary the read timeout to be the remainder, but there aren't accessors to allow that. \n\nOne possibility would be to set a low read timeout, and then repeatedly catch on each read attempt until we elapsed the total timeout. I have not tested that in depth across each platform to make sure that it's safe to continue attempting to read after a socket read timeout. And so am leaving the current impl as is.\n\nWhen using the HttpClient (as in JDK 11+) the timeout behaves as desired - the connect and read are balanced dynamically.\n\n","author_association":"OWNER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jhy/jsoup/issues/comments/2993871711/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"jhy","id":76934,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc2OTM0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/76934?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy","html_url":"https://github.com/jhy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"actor":{"login":"jhy","id":76934,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc2OTM0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/76934?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy","html_url":"https://github.com/jhy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-06-22T01:55:03Z","updated_at":"2025-06-22T01:55:03Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jhy/jsoup/issues/1228","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jhy/jsoup","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jhy/jsoup/issues/1228/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jhy/jsoup/issues/1228/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jhy/jsoup/issues/1228/events","html_url":"https://github.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/1228","id":451801659,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU0NTE4MDE2NTk=","number":1228,"title":"Create
