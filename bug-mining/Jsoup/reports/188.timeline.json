all for your reviews on this. \r\n\r\n@csaboka in looking at your notes and the PR -- the only local repro I can get is with your test in TokeniserTest -https://github.com/jhy/jsoup/pull/1225/files#diff-886e5a4f90143c287a5dfcf4c27964ea . The test in src/test/java/org/jsoup/parser/CharacterReaderTest.java passes already in master. Did it fail for you before your changes?\r\n\r\nI can repro with the gist @krystiangorecki posted if loading from that URL, but not if I serve the same file from the Jetty integ test server.\r\n\r\nI understand the bug but there is a sensitivity in the reader length return I am not quite following yet -- want to make sure we get to a 100% fix here.\r\n\r\n@csaboka I like the approach of your PR generally. I am conscious that this is a memory and latency optimized area, so am reluctant to add a bunch of new string buffers (and ongoing bufferUp() calls) if we  can help it. I have a mostly working solution which doesn't add another buffer for marks, but during bufferUp() will not invalidate the mark, but will move it to the front of the buffer instead. Because we know the largest expected mark size (the largest character reference), we can enforce it not to fail.\r\n\r\n@wx2020 thanks for your note. For clarity in 1.11.3 everything was not fine; the same buffer underrun happened, we just didn't throw a validation error. It just would have silently corrupted the input data.\r\n\r\n

Did it fail for you before your changes?\r\n\r\nNo, now that I've looked at it again, the test passes without my changes. If I change the consumeTo() line from this:\r\n`r.consumeTo(\"four\");`\r\nto this:\r\n`assertEquals(\"one two three \", r.consumeTo(\"four\"));`\r\nit fails, though. consumeTo() only consumes till the end of the currently buffered data without my changes, so it returns just \"one\". Unfortunately, it's still broken *with* my changes. Apparently, the code still doesn't handle properly when the search text straddles between buffer boundaries, so it reads until the end in that case. I don't know how to fix this properly, and I don't have time ATM to investigate it further.\r\n\r\n> I am conscious that this is a memory and latency optimized area, so am reluctant to add a bunch of new string buffers (and ongoing bufferUp() calls) if we can help it.\r\n\r\nBuffers should only be created in the hopefully rare case of reads straddling buffer boundaries. In the real world, when you buffer up kilobytes of markup at a time, it probably wouldn't cause that much garbage.\r\n\r\n> I have a mostly working solution which doesn't add another buffer for marks, but during bufferUp() will not invalidate the mark, but will move it to the front of the buffer instead.\r\n\r\nFixing marking will deal with this specific exception, it won't solve all issues with large inputs. The various consumeXxx() methods don't \"see beyond\" what's currently buffered, so they could fail to find things and return all the remaining buffer (not all data until the end of the stream, just what's in the buffer) if what they're looking for ends beyond the currently buffered data. The second commit of my PR tried to fix that, but apparently it's still not working for all cases. In general, it's pretty hard to consume up to some character sequence without using a temporary StringBuilder if you need to consider that you may have to read multiple \"buffer-fuls\" of data until you find what you're looking for.\r\n\r\n> What would be great is if we can get a local repro without modifying the read() limit artificially.\r\n\r\nI can try coming up with a case that breaks the current code without introducing a custom Reader implementation tomorrow. It should just generate enough padding so that the \"interesting\" part straddles the buffer boundary.","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jhy/jsoup/issues/comments/507952187/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"csaboka","id":2852084,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4NTIwODQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2852084?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/csaboka","html_url":"https://github.com/csaboka","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/csaboka/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/csaboka/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/csaboka/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/csaboka/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/csaboka/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/csaboka/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/csaboka/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/csaboka/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/csaboka/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jhy/jsoup/issues/comments/507956423","html_url":"https://github.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/1218#issuecomment-507956423","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jhy/jsoup/issues/1218","id":507956423,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUwNzk1NjQyMw==","user":{"login":"csaboka","id":2852084,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4NTIwODQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2852084?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/csaboka","html_url":"https://github.com/csaboka","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/csaboka/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/csaboka/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/csaboka/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/csaboka/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/csaboka/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/csaboka/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/csaboka/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/csaboka/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/csaboka/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-07-03T06:21:11Z","updated_at":"2019-07-03T06:21:11Z","body":"> because of using a buffered input, which will try to fill the larger length\r\n\r\nHmm, apparently it's not safe to assume that BufferedReader will always try to fill the buffer completely. This is what [the Javadoc](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/io/BufferedReader.html#read-char:A-int-int-) says:\r\n\r\nThis iterated read continues until one of the following conditions becomes true:\r\n\r\nThe specified number of characters have been read,\r\nThe read method of the underlying stream returns -1, indicating end-of-file, or\r\n**The ready method of the underlying stream returns false, indicating that further input requests would block.**\r\n\r\nSo if you're feeding jsoup directly from an HTTP response stream, and the server is taking its time sending the next chunk, the reads will only report what's already available without blocking and you may only get a few bytes' worth of data in bufferUp() even if you have a generous

: This has taken me a bit more than originally expected, but I could spend some time on understanding CharacterReader again today. I have to correct myself: I don't think it's possible for marking (and therefore entity parsing) to fail with an in-memory reader, unless you have an absurdly long entity, longer than the maximum buffer length of 32K.\r\n\r\nThe mark() method does a very eager bufferUp() that always tries to fill all the remaining buffer, i.e. normally it should have 32K characters of look-ahead. The only case this could fail is if the read() call invoked by bufferUp() doesn't fill the available buffer even though it's not EOF yet. In other words, BufferedReader() must have stopped its loop because it saw that the underlying reader is not ready. This could be worked around by calling read() in a loop until the buffer is completely filled or EOF is reported.\r\n\r\nWhile investigating the callers of various CharacterReader methods, I've also found an issue where a very long bogus comment could be misparsed. I've created [a new branch](https://github.com/csaboka/jsoup/tree/parsing-issues) that contains only new unit tests failing with the latest master (the two tests included in my previous PR plus the one for bogus comments).\r\n\r\nI believe this issue could be resolved by switching from a single read() call to calling read() in a loop, and changing the BogusComment tokeniser state to handle underruns. I'll try to make those fixes later and add them to the new branch. If it works out, it would require just one unintrusive change instead of the bunch of changes required by my previous PR.","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jhy/jsoup/issues/comments/509389109/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"csaboka","id":2852084,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4NTIwODQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2852084?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/csaboka","html_url":"https://github.com/csaboka","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/csaboka/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/csaboka/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/csaboka/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/csaboka/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/csaboka/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/csaboka/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/csaboka/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/csaboka/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/csaboka/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":2467423024,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MjQ2NzQyMzAyNA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jhy/jsoup/issues/events/2467423024","actor":{"login":"jhy","id":76934,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc2OTM0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/76934?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy","html_url":"https://github.com/jhy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-07-08T20:58:17Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2467423025,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDI0Njc0MjMwMjU=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jhy/jsoup/issues/events/2467423025","actor":{"login":"jhy","id":76934,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc2OTM0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/76934?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy","html_url":"https://github.com/jhy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-07-08T20:58:17Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jhy/jsoup/issues/comments/511749589","html_url":"https://github.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/1218#issuecomment-511749589","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jhy/jsoup/issues/1218","id":511749589,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUxMTc0OTU4OQ==","user":{"login":"csaboka","id":2852084,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4NTIwODQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2852084?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/csaboka","html_url":"https://github.com/csaboka","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/csaboka/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/csaboka/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/csaboka/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/csaboka/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/csaboka/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/csaboka/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/csaboka/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/csaboka/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/csaboka/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-07-16T09:55:15Z","updated_at":"2019-07-16T09:55:15Z","body":"Opened #1242 for another stab at fixing this issue.
