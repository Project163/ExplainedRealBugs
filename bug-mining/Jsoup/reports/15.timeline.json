I'm not really sure the best way to fix this. Jsoup uses Java's URL parser, and it seems to be mishandling this case. The method used is http://download.oracle.com/javase/1.4.2/docs/api/java/net/URL.html#URL(java.net.URL, java.lang.String)\n\nWhere URL is the origin URL, and the spec string is the contents of the href.\n\nMay need to provide a hack for this specific case, or reimplement the URL parser; not really keen on either.\n","author_association":"OWNER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jhy/jsoup/issues/comments/549195/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"jhy","id":76934,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc2OTM0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/76934?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy","html_url":"https://github.com/jhy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jhy/jsoup/issues/comments/560085","html_url":"https://github.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/49#issuecomment-560085","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jhy/jsoup/issues/49","id":560085,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU2MDA4NQ==","user":{"login":"jhy","id":76934,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc2OTM0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/76934?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy","html_url":"https://github.com/jhy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2010-11-22T22:54:43Z","updated_at":"2010-11-22T22:54:43Z","body":"Fixed
