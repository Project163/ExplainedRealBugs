we parse an attribute like `<test =foo=bar/>` Then in the DOM the attribute appears with the = sign, but when re-serialized it is generated without.\r\n\r\nCode:\r\n```\r\nval doc = Jsoup.parse(\"<test =foo=\\\"bar\\\"/>\")\r\nfor (elem in doc.select(\"test\")) {\r\n    for (attr in  elem.attributes()) {\r\n        println(attr.key)\r\n

application is doing validation on the key, to prevent XSS attacks, this can be a way to bypass the validation. I discovered this issue (in a lab environment, not a live app) just now.\r\n\r\nThe key for output can be accessed using `getValidKey()`. A potential solution to this is to normalise keys during parsing.","closed_by":{"login":"jhy","id":76934,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc2OTM0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/76934?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy","html_url":"https://github.com/jhy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jhy/jsoup/issues/2143/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":1},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jhy/jsoup/issues/2143/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
