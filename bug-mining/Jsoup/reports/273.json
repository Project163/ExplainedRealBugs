updating to latest JSoup version I got unit test failing because `Attributes` equals implementation changed.\r\nI believe it is a bug as the javadoc says:\r\n> Attributes are treated as a map\r\n\r\nAs a simple test:\r\n```java\r\nfinal Attributes attributesBarFoo = Jsoup.parseBodyFragment(\"<a style=\\\"bar\\\" class=\\\"foo\\\">\").select(\"a\").first().attributes();\r\nfinal Attributes attributesFooBar = Jsoup.parseBodyFragment(\"<a class=\\\"foo\\\" style=\\\"bar\\\">\").select(\"a\").first().attributes();\r\nassertEquals(attributesBarFoo, attributesFooBar);\r\n```\r\nresults in\r\n```\r\norg.opentest4j.AssertionFailedError: \r\nExpected : style=\"bar\" class=\"foo\"\r\nActual   : class=\"foo\" style=\"bar\"\r\n```\r\nI believe it was introduced in version `1.11.1` with commit ea1fb65e9ff8eee82c4e379dc3236d09a5ab02e1\r\n\r\nAlso, thanks for your great work on this amazing
