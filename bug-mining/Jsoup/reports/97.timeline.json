For example, the `disabled` attribute is ignored and radio buttons should be included when checked only (and of course only a single value can be included when `name` is the same).\n\nShould it be improved as a whole? Or just add the default value for check boxes?\n","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jhy/jsoup/issues/comments/61502560/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"cromoteca","id":498086,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5ODA4Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/498086?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cromoteca","html_url":"https://github.com/cromoteca","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cromoteca/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cromoteca/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cromoteca/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cromoteca/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cromoteca/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cromoteca/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cromoteca/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cromoteca/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cromoteca/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jhy/jsoup/issues/comments/61509633","html_url":"https://github.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/489#issuecomment-61509633","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jhy/jsoup/issues/489","id":61509633,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYxNTA5NjMz","user":{"login":"Freddy12","id":7262585,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcyNjI1ODU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7262585?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Freddy12","html_url":"https://github.com/Freddy12","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Freddy12/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Freddy12/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Freddy12/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Freddy12/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Freddy12/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Freddy12/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Freddy12/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Freddy12/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Freddy12/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-11-03T16:58:09Z","updated_at":"2014-11-03T16:59:27Z","body":"I think it should be improved as a whole.\n\nIt should be similar as much as possible to standard browser behavior when submitting a form. \n\nWhat's the point of \"formData()\" method (and submit() in \"Connection\" class since it uses the same \"formData()\") if it gets (sends) the wrong values.
