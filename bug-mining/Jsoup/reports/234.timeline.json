I generally don't like adding special case getElementsBy.. methods as they're very verbose and not flexible. And obviously just adding a boolean param as a filter option is going to be backwards incompatible.\r\n\r\nI would suggest using the Element#select(query) method instead and use a query like \":root > tag\" (call select on the element which children you want). That will scope :root to the element and then find direct descendants only.
