team and I have encountered `NoSuchElementException` when parsing and selecting elements.\r\n\r\nOur caller uses the parser to parse HTML into a document, selects one of the elements and attempts to access sub-elements through a `select` call with a passed in `evaluator`.  All interactions with the document, including parsing, element selection, and sub-element access, are confined to a solitary thread.\r\n\r\nThe stack trace from the caller is as follows:\r\n```\r\n java.util.NoSuchElementException: null\r\n at org.jsoup.nodes.NodeIterator.next(NodeIterator.java:69)\r\n at org.jsoup.select.StructuralEvaluator$Has.matches(StructuralEvaluator.java:73)\r\n at org.jsoup.select.CombiningEvaluator$And.matches(CombiningEvaluator.java:84)\r\n at org.jsoup.select.StructuralEvaluator$ImmediateParentRun.matches(StructuralEvaluator.java:218)\r\n at org.jsoup.select.CombiningEvaluator$Or.matches(CombiningEvaluator.java:125)\r\n at org.jsoup.select.Evaluator.lambda$asPredicate$0(Evaluator.java:38)\r\n at java.base/java.util.stream.ReferencePipeline$2$1.accept(ReferencePipeline.java:178)\r\n at java.base/java.util.Iterator.forEachRemaining(Iterator.java:133)\r\n at java.base/java.util.Spliterators$IteratorSpliterator.forEachRemaining(Spliterators.java:1845)\r\n at java.base/java.util.stream.AbstractPipeline.copyInto(AbstractPipeline.java:509)\r\n at java.base/java.util.stream.AbstractPipeline.wrapAndCopyInto(AbstractPipeline.java:499)\r\n at java.base/java.util.stream.ReduceOps$ReduceOp.evaluateSequential(ReduceOps.java:921)\r\n at java.base/java.util.stream.AbstractPipeline.evaluate(AbstractPipeline.java:234)\r\n at java.base/java.util.stream.ReferencePipeline.collect(ReferencePipeline.java:682)\r\n at org.jsoup.select.Collector.collect(Collector.java:29)\r\n at org.jsoup.select.Selector.select(Selector.java:111)\r\n at org.jsoup.nodes.Element.select(Element.java:463)\r\n```\r\n\r\nTracing that, it appears to be throwing [here](https://github.com/jhy/jsoup/blob/d5bc100eab6238b4b682a45fc04e829ff46459ef/src/main/java/org/jsoup/nodes/NodeIterator.java#L69), which shouldn't be possible because of the null check in the caller [here](https://github.com/jhy/jsoup/blob/d5bc100eab6238b4b682a45fc04e829ff46459ef/src/main/java/org/jsoup/select/StructuralEvaluator.java#L72-L73).\r\n\r\nWe haven't been able to reproduce from a standalone test case, but have seen it occur intermittently twice now in a long-running process.\r\n\r\nOur service currently uses `jsoup 1.17.1` on `Amazon Corretto 17` images.
