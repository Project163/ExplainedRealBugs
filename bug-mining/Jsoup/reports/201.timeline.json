newline</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Removed old methods and classes that were marked deprecated in previous releases.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>**** Release 1.12.2 [2020-Feb-08]</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: the :has() selector now supports relative selectors. For example, the query\n&quot;div:has(&gt; a)&quot; will select all &quot;div&quot; elements that have at least one direct child &quot;a&quot; element.\n<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/jhy/jsoup/pull/1214\">jhy/jsoup#1214</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Bugfix: in a <select> tag, a second <optgroup> would not automatically close an earlier open <optgroup>\n<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/1313\">jhy/jsoup#1313</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: added Element chaining methods for various overridden methods on Node.\n<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/1193\">jhy/jsoup#1193</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: ensure HTTP keepalives work when fetching content via body() and bodyAsBytes().\n<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/1232\">jhy/jsoup#1232</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: set the default max body size in Jsoup.Connection to 2MB (up from 1MB) so fewer people get trimmed\ncontent if they have not set it, but still in sensible bounds. Also updated the default user-agent to improve\ndefault compatibility.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: dramatic speed improvement when bulk inserting child nodes into an element (wrapping contents).\n<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/1281\">jhy/jsoup#1281</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: added Element#childrenSize() as a convenience to get the size of an element's element children.\n<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/jhy/jsoup/pull/1291\">jhy/jsoup#1291</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: in W3CDom.asString, allow the output mode to be specified as HTML or as XML. It will default to\nchecking the content, and automatically selecting.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: added a Document#documentType() method, to get a doc's doctype.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: To DocumentType, added #name(), #publicID(), and #systemId() methods to fetch those fields.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: in W3CDom conversions from jsoup documents, retain the DocumentType, and be able to serialize it.\n<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/1183\">jhy/jsoup#1183</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Bugfix: on pages fetch by Jsoup.Connection, a &quot;Mark Invalid&quot; exception might be incorrectly thrown, or the page may\nmiss some data. This occurred on larger pages when the file transfer was chunked, and an invalid HTML entity\nhappened to cross a chunk boundary.\n<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/1218\">jhy/jsoup#1218</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Bugfix: if duplicate attributes in an element exist, retain the first vs the last attribute with the same name.

changelog</a>.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>jsoup changelog</p>\n<p>*** Release 1.13.1 [PENDING]</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: decent memory optimization by not creating Attribute objects for each Element unless/until the Element\ngets an attribute.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: when pretty-printing, comments in inline tags are not pushed to a newline</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: added Attributes#hasValue(key) and Attribute#hasValue(), to check if an attribute is set but has no\nvalue. Useful in place of the deprecated and removed BooleanAttribute class and instanceof test.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Bugfix: in a <select> tag, a second <optgroup> would not automatically close an earlier open <optgroup>\n<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/1313\">jhy/jsoup#1313</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Removed old methods and classes that were marked deprecated in previous releases.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>**** Release 1.12.2 [2020-Feb-08]</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: the :has() selector now supports relative selectors. For example, the query\n&quot;div:has(&gt; a)&quot; will select all &quot;div&quot; elements that have at least one direct child &quot;a&quot; element.\n<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/jhy/jsoup/pull/1214\">jhy/jsoup#1214</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: added Element chaining methods for various overridden methods on Node.\n<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/1193\">jhy/jsoup#1193</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: ensure HTTP keepalives work when fetching content via body() and bodyAsBytes().\n<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/1232\">jhy/jsoup#1232</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: set the default max body size in Jsoup.Connection to 2MB (up from 1MB) so fewer people get trimmed\ncontent if they have not set it, but still in sensible bounds. Also updated the default user-agent to improve\ndefault compatibility.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: dramatic speed improvement when bulk inserting child nodes into an element (wrapping contents).\n<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/1281\">jhy/jsoup#1281</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: added Element#childrenSize() as a convenience to get the size of an element's element children.\n<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/jhy/jsoup/pull/1291\">jhy/jsoup#1291</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: in W3CDom.asString, allow the output mode to be specified as HTML or as XML. It will default to\nchecking the content, and automatically selecting.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: added a Document#documentType() method, to get a doc's doctype.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: To DocumentType, added #name(), #publicID(), and #systemId() methods to fetch those fields.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: in W3CDom conversions from jsoup documents, retain the DocumentType, and be able to serialize it.\n<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/1183\">jhy/jsoup#1183</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Bugfix: on pages fetch by Jsoup.Connection, a &quot;Mark Invalid&quot; exception might be incorrectly thrown, or the page may\nmiss some data. This occurred on larger pages when the file transfer was chunked, and an invalid HTML entity\nhappened to cross a chunk boundary.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</tr></table> ...

changelog</a>.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>jsoup changelog</p>\n<p>*** Release 1.13.1 [PENDING]</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: decent memory optimization by not creating Attribute objects for each Element unless/until the Element\ngets an attribute.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: when pretty-printing, comments in inline tags are not pushed to a newline</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: added Attributes#hasValue(key) and Attribute#hasValue(), to check if an attribute is set but has no\nvalue. Useful in place of the deprecated and removed BooleanAttribute class and instanceof test.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Bugfix: in a <select> tag, a second <optgroup> would not automatically close an earlier open <optgroup>\n<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/1313\">jhy/jsoup#1313</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Removed old methods and classes that were marked deprecated in previous releases.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>**** Release 1.12.2 [2020-Feb-08]</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: the :has() selector now supports relative selectors. For example, the query\n&quot;div:has(&gt; a)&quot; will select all &quot;div&quot; elements that have at least one direct child &quot;a&quot; element.\n<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/jhy/jsoup/pull/1214\">jhy/jsoup#1214</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: added Element chaining methods for various overridden methods on Node.\n<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/1193\">jhy/jsoup#1193</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: ensure HTTP keepalives work when fetching content via body() and bodyAsBytes().\n<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/1232\">jhy/jsoup#1232</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: set the default max body size in Jsoup.Connection to 2MB (up from 1MB) so fewer people get trimmed\ncontent if they have not set it, but still in sensible bounds. Also updated the default user-agent to improve\ndefault compatibility.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: dramatic speed improvement when bulk inserting child nodes into an element (wrapping contents).\n<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/1281\">jhy/jsoup#1281</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: added Element#childrenSize() as a convenience to get the size of an element's element children.\n<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/jhy/jsoup/pull/1291\">jhy/jsoup#1291</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: in W3CDom.asString, allow the output mode to be specified as HTML or as XML. It will default to\nchecking the content, and automatically selecting.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: added a Document#documentType() method, to get a doc's doctype.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: To DocumentType, added #name(), #publicID(), and #systemId() methods to fetch those fields.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: in W3CDom conversions from jsoup documents, retain the DocumentType, and be able to serialize it.\n<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/1183\">jhy/jsoup#1183</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Bugfix: on pages fetch by Jsoup.Connection, a &quot;Mark Invalid&quot; exception might be incorrectly thrown, or the page may\nmiss some data. This occurred on larger pages when the file transfer was chunked, and an invalid HTML entity\nhappened to cross a chunk boundary.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</tr></table> ...

[jsoup](https://github.com/jhy/jsoup) from 1.12.1 to 1.12.2.\n<details>\n<summary>Changelog</summary>\n<p><em>Sourced from <a href=\"https://github.com/jhy/jsoup/blob/master/CHANGES\">jsoup's changelog</a>.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>jsoup changelog</p>\n<p>*** Release 1.13.1 [PENDING]</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: decent memory optimization by not creating Attribute objects for each Element unless/until the Element\ngets an attribute.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: when pretty-printing, comments in inline tags are not pushed to a newline</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: added Attributes#hasValue(key) and Attribute#hasValue(), to check if an attribute is set but has no\nvalue. Useful in place of the deprecated and removed BooleanAttribute class and instanceof test.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Bugfix: in a <select> tag, a second <optgroup> would not automatically close an earlier open <optgroup>\n<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/1313\">jhy/jsoup#1313</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Removed old methods and classes that were marked deprecated in previous releases.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>**** Release 1.12.2 [2020-Feb-08]</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: the :has() selector now supports relative selectors. For example, the query\n&quot;div:has(&gt; a)&quot; will select all &quot;div&quot; elements that have at least one direct child &quot;a&quot; element.\n<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/jhy/jsoup/pull/1214\">jhy/jsoup#1214</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: added Element chaining methods for various overridden methods on Node.\n<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/1193\">jhy/jsoup#1193</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: ensure HTTP keepalives work when fetching content via body() and bodyAsBytes().\n<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/1232\">jhy/jsoup#1232</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: set the default max body size in Jsoup.Connection to 2MB (up from 1MB) so fewer people get trimmed\ncontent if they have not set it, but still in sensible bounds. Also updated the default user-agent to improve\ndefault compatibility.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: dramatic speed improvement when bulk inserting child nodes into an element (wrapping contents).\n<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/1281\">jhy/jsoup#1281</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: added Element#childrenSize() as a convenience to get the size of an element's element children.\n<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/jhy/jsoup/pull/1291\">jhy/jsoup#1291</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: in W3CDom.asString, allow the output mode to be specified as HTML or as XML. It will default to\nchecking the content, and automatically selecting.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: added a Document#documentType() method, to get a doc's doctype.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: To DocumentType, added #name(), #publicID(), and #systemId() methods to fetch those fields.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: in W3CDom conversions from jsoup documents, retain the DocumentType, and be able to serialize it.\n<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/1183\">jhy/jsoup#1183</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Bugfix: on pages fetch by Jsoup.Connection, a &quot;Mark Invalid&quot; exception might be incorrectly thrown, or the page may\nmiss some data. This occurred on larger pages when the file transfer was chunked, and an invalid HTML entity\nhappened to cross a chunk boundary.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</tr></table> ...

[jsoup](https://github.com/jhy/jsoup) from 1.12.1 to 1.12.2.\n<details>\n<summary>Changelog</summary>\n<p><em>Sourced from <a href=\"https://github.com/jhy/jsoup/blob/master/CHANGES\">jsoup's changelog</a>.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>jsoup changelog</p>\n<p>*** Release 1.13.1 [PENDING]</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: decent memory optimization by not creating Attribute objects for each Element unless/until the Element\ngets an attribute.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: when pretty-printing, comments in inline tags are not pushed to a newline</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: added Attributes#hasValue(key) and Attribute#hasValue(), to check if an attribute is set but has no\nvalue. Useful in place of the deprecated and removed BooleanAttribute class and instanceof test.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Bugfix: in a <select> tag, a second <optgroup> would not automatically close an earlier open <optgroup>\n<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/1313\">jhy/jsoup#1313</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Removed old methods and classes that were marked deprecated in previous releases.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>**** Release 1.12.2 [2020-Feb-08]</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: the :has() selector now supports relative selectors. For example, the query\n&quot;div:has(&gt; a)&quot; will select all &quot;div&quot; elements that have at least one direct child &quot;a&quot; element.\n<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/jhy/jsoup/pull/1214\">jhy/jsoup#1214</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: added Element chaining methods for various overridden methods on Node.\n<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/1193\">jhy/jsoup#1193</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: ensure HTTP keepalives work when fetching content via body() and bodyAsBytes().\n<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/1232\">jhy/jsoup#1232</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: set the default max body size in Jsoup.Connection to 2MB (up from 1MB) so fewer people get trimmed\ncontent if they have not set it, but still in sensible bounds. Also updated the default user-agent to improve\ndefault compatibility.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: dramatic speed improvement when bulk inserting child nodes into an element (wrapping contents).\n<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/1281\">jhy/jsoup#1281</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: added Element#childrenSize() as a convenience to get the size of an element's element children.\n<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/jhy/jsoup/pull/1291\">jhy/jsoup#1291</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: in W3CDom.asString, allow the output mode to be specified as HTML or as XML. It will default to\nchecking the content, and automatically selecting.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: added a Document#documentType() method, to get a doc's doctype.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: To DocumentType, added #name(), #publicID(), and #systemId() methods to fetch those fields.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: in W3CDom conversions from jsoup documents, retain the DocumentType, and be able to serialize it.\n<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/1183\">jhy/jsoup#1183</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Bugfix: on pages fetch by Jsoup.Connection, a &quot;Mark Invalid&quot; exception might be incorrectly thrown, or the page may\nmiss some data. This occurred on larger pages when the file transfer was chunked, and an invalid HTML entity\nhappened to cross a chunk boundary.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</tr></table> ...

[jsoup](https://github.com/jhy/jsoup) from 1.12.1 to 1.12.2.\n<details>\n<summary>Changelog</summary>\n<p><em>Sourced from <a href=\"https://github.com/jhy/jsoup/blob/master/CHANGES\">jsoup's changelog</a>.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>jsoup changelog</p>\n<p>*** Release 1.13.1 [PENDING]</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: decent memory optimization by not creating Attribute objects for each Element unless/until the Element\ngets an attribute.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: when pretty-printing, comments in inline tags are not pushed to a newline</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: added Attributes#hasValue(key) and Attribute#hasValue(), to check if an attribute is set but has no\nvalue. Useful in place of the deprecated and removed BooleanAttribute class and instanceof test.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Bugfix: in a <select> tag, a second <optgroup> would not automatically close an earlier open <optgroup>\n<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/1313\">jhy/jsoup#1313</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Removed old methods and classes that were marked deprecated in previous releases.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>**** Release 1.12.2 [2020-Feb-08]</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: the :has() selector now supports relative selectors. For example, the query\n&quot;div:has(&gt; a)&quot; will select all &quot;div&quot; elements that have at least one direct child &quot;a&quot; element.\n<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/jhy/jsoup/pull/1214\">jhy/jsoup#1214</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: added Element chaining methods for various overridden methods on Node.\n<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/1193\">jhy/jsoup#1193</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: ensure HTTP keepalives work when fetching content via body() and bodyAsBytes().\n<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/1232\">jhy/jsoup#1232</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: set the default max body size in Jsoup.Connection to 2MB (up from 1MB) so fewer people get trimmed\ncontent if they have not set it, but still in sensible bounds. Also updated the default user-agent to improve\ndefault compatibility.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: dramatic speed improvement when bulk inserting child nodes into an element (wrapping contents).\n<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/1281\">jhy/jsoup#1281</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: added Element#childrenSize() as a convenience to get the size of an element's element children.\n<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/jhy/jsoup/pull/1291\">jhy/jsoup#1291</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: in W3CDom.asString, allow the output mode to be specified as HTML or as XML. It will default to\nchecking the content, and automatically selecting.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: added a Document#documentType() method, to get a doc's doctype.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: To DocumentType, added #name(), #publicID(), and #systemId() methods to fetch those fields.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: in W3CDom conversions from jsoup documents, retain the DocumentType, and be able to serialize it.\n<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/1183\">jhy/jsoup#1183</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Bugfix: on pages fetch by Jsoup.Connection, a &quot;Mark Invalid&quot; exception might be incorrectly thrown, or the page may\nmiss some data. This occurred on larger pages when the file transfer was chunked, and an invalid HTML entity\nhappened to cross a chunk boundary.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</tr></table> ...

[jsoup](https://github.com/jhy/jsoup) from 1.12.1 to 1.12.2.\n<details>\n<summary>Changelog</summary>\n<p><em>Sourced from <a href=\"https://github.com/jhy/jsoup/blob/master/CHANGES\">jsoup's changelog</a>.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>jsoup changelog</p>\n<p>*** Release 1.13.1 [PENDING]</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: decent memory optimization by not creating Attribute objects for each Element unless/until the Element\ngets an attribute.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: when pretty-printing, comments in inline tags are not pushed to a newline</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: added Attributes#hasValue(key) and Attribute#hasValue(), to check if an attribute is set but has no\nvalue. Useful in place of the deprecated and removed BooleanAttribute class and instanceof test.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Bugfix: in a <select> tag, a second <optgroup> would not automatically close an earlier open <optgroup>\n<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/1313\">jhy/jsoup#1313</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Removed old methods and classes that were marked deprecated in previous releases.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>**** Release 1.12.2 [2020-Feb-08]</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: the :has() selector now supports relative selectors. For example, the query\n&quot;div:has(&gt; a)&quot; will select all &quot;div&quot; elements that have at least one direct child &quot;a&quot; element.\n<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/jhy/jsoup/pull/1214\">jhy/jsoup#1214</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: added Element chaining methods for various overridden methods on Node.\n<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/1193\">jhy/jsoup#1193</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: ensure HTTP keepalives work when fetching content via body() and bodyAsBytes().\n<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/1232\">jhy/jsoup#1232</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: set the default max body size in Jsoup.Connection to 2MB (up from 1MB) so fewer people get trimmed\ncontent if they have not set it, but still in sensible bounds. Also updated the default user-agent to improve\ndefault compatibility.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: dramatic speed improvement when bulk inserting child nodes into an element (wrapping contents).\n<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/1281\">jhy/jsoup#1281</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: added Element#childrenSize() as a convenience to get the size of an element's element children.\n<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/jhy/jsoup/pull/1291\">jhy/jsoup#1291</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: in W3CDom.asString, allow the output mode to be specified as HTML or as XML. It will default to\nchecking the content, and automatically selecting.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: added a Document#documentType() method, to get a doc's doctype.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: To DocumentType, added #name(), #publicID(), and #systemId() methods to fetch those fields.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: in W3CDom conversions from jsoup documents, retain the DocumentType, and be able to serialize it.\n<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/1183\">jhy/jsoup#1183</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Bugfix: on pages fetch by Jsoup.Connection, a &quot;Mark Invalid&quot; exception might be incorrectly thrown, or the page may\nmiss some data. This occurred on larger pages when the file transfer was chunked, and an invalid HTML entity\nhappened to cross a chunk boundary.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</tr></table> ...

changelog</a>.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>jsoup changelog</p>\n<p>*** Release 1.13.1 [PENDING]</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: decent memory optimization by not creating Attribute objects for each Element unless/until the Element\ngets an attribute.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: when pretty-printing, comments in inline tags are not pushed to a newline</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: added Attributes#hasValue(key) and Attribute#hasValue(), to check if an attribute is set but has no\nvalue. Useful in place of the deprecated and removed BooleanAttribute class and instanceof test.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Bugfix: in a <select> tag, a second <optgroup> would not automatically close an earlier open <optgroup>\n<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/1313\">jhy/jsoup#1313</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Removed old methods and classes that were marked deprecated in previous releases.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>**** Release 1.12.2 [2020-Feb-08]</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: the :has() selector now supports relative selectors. For example, the query\n&quot;div:has(&gt; a)&quot; will select all &quot;div&quot; elements that have at least one direct child &quot;a&quot; element.\n<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/jhy/jsoup/pull/1214\">jhy/jsoup#1214</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: added Element chaining methods for various overridden methods on Node.\n<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/1193\">jhy/jsoup#1193</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: ensure HTTP keepalives work when fetching content via body() and bodyAsBytes().\n<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/1232\">jhy/jsoup#1232</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: set the default max body size in Jsoup.Connection to 2MB (up from 1MB) so fewer people get trimmed\ncontent if they have not set it, but still in sensible bounds. Also updated the default user-agent to improve\ndefault compatibility.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: dramatic speed improvement when bulk inserting child nodes into an element (wrapping contents).\n<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/1281\">jhy/jsoup#1281</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: added Element#childrenSize() as a convenience to get the size of an element's element children.\n<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/jhy/jsoup/pull/1291\">jhy/jsoup#1291</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: in W3CDom.asString, allow the output mode to be specified as HTML or as XML. It will default to\nchecking the content, and automatically selecting.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: added a Document#documentType() method, to get a doc's doctype.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: To DocumentType, added #name(), #publicID(), and #systemId() methods to fetch those fields.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: in W3CDom conversions from jsoup documents, retain the DocumentType, and be able to serialize it.\n<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/1183\">jhy/jsoup#1183</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Bugfix: on pages fetch by Jsoup.Connection, a &quot;Mark Invalid&quot; exception might be incorrectly thrown, or the page may\nmiss some data. This occurred on larger pages when the file transfer was chunked, and an invalid HTML entity\nhappened to cross a chunk boundary.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</tr></table> ...

For example, the query\n&quot;div:has(&gt; a)&quot; will select all &quot;div&quot; elements that have at least one direct child &quot;a&quot; element.\n<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/jhy/jsoup/pull/1214\">jhy/jsoup#1214</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: added Element chaining methods for various overridden methods on Node.\n<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/1193\">jhy/jsoup#1193</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: ensure HTTP keepalives work when fetching content via body() and bodyAsBytes().\n<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/1232\">jhy/jsoup#1232</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: set the default max body size in Jsoup.Connection to 2MB (up from 1MB) so fewer people get trimmed\ncontent if they have not set it, but still in sensible bounds. Also updated the default user-agent to improve\ndefault compatibility.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: dramatic speed improvement when bulk inserting child nodes into an element (wrapping contents).\n<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/1281\">jhy/jsoup#1281</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: added Element#childrenSize() as a convenience to get the size of an element's element children.\n<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/jhy/jsoup/pull/1291\">jhy/jsoup#1291</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: in W3CDom.asString, allow the output mode to be specified as HTML or as XML. It will default to\nchecking the content, and automatically selecting.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: added a Document#documentType() method, to get a doc's doctype.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: To DocumentType, added #name(), #publicID(), and #systemId() methods to fetch those fields.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: in W3CDom conversions from jsoup documents, retain the DocumentType, and be able to serialize it.\n<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/1183\">jhy/jsoup#1183</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Bugfix: on pages fetch by Jsoup.Connection, a &quot;Mark Invalid&quot; exception might be incorrectly thrown, or the page may\nmiss some data. This occurred on larger pages when the file transfer was chunked, and an invalid HTML entity\nhappened to cross a chunk boundary.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</tr></table> ...

[jsoup](https://github.com/jhy/jsoup) from 1.12.1 to 1.12.2.\n<details>\n<summary>Changelog</summary>\n<p><em>Sourced from <a href=\"https://github.com/jhy/jsoup/blob/master/CHANGES\">jsoup's changelog</a>.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>jsoup changelog</p>\n<p>*** Release 1.13.1 [PENDING]</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: decent memory optimization by not creating Attribute objects for each Element unless/until the Element\ngets an attribute.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: when pretty-printing, comments in inline tags are not pushed to a newline</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: added Attributes#hasValue(key) and Attribute#hasValue(), to check if an attribute is set but has no\nvalue. Useful in place of the deprecated and removed BooleanAttribute class and instanceof test.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Bugfix: in a <select> tag, a second <optgroup> would not automatically close an earlier open <optgroup>\n<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/1313\">jhy/jsoup#1313</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Removed old methods and classes that were marked deprecated in previous releases.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>**** Release 1.12.2 [2020-Feb-08]</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: the :has() selector now supports relative selectors. For example, the query\n&quot;div:has(&gt; a)&quot; will select all &quot;div&quot; elements that have at least one direct child &quot;a&quot; element.\n<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/jhy/jsoup/pull/1214\">jhy/jsoup#1214</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: added Element chaining methods for various overridden methods on Node.\n<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/1193\">jhy/jsoup#1193</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: ensure HTTP keepalives work when fetching content via body() and bodyAsBytes().\n<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/1232\">jhy/jsoup#1232</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: set the default max body size in Jsoup.Connection to 2MB (up from 1MB) so fewer people get trimmed\ncontent if they have not set it, but still in sensible bounds. Also updated the default user-agent to improve\ndefault compatibility.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: dramatic speed improvement when bulk inserting child nodes into an element (wrapping contents).\n<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/1281\">jhy/jsoup#1281</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: added Element#childrenSize() as a convenience to get the size of an element's element children.\n<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/jhy/jsoup/pull/1291\">jhy/jsoup#1291</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: in W3CDom.asString, allow the output mode to be specified as HTML or as XML. It will default to\nchecking the content, and automatically selecting.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: added a Document#documentType() method, to get a doc's doctype.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: To DocumentType, added #name(), #publicID(), and #systemId() methods to fetch those fields.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: in W3CDom conversions from jsoup documents, retain the DocumentType, and be able to serialize it.\n<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/1183\">jhy/jsoup#1183</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Bugfix: on pages fetch by Jsoup.Connection, a &quot;Mark Invalid&quot; exception might be incorrectly thrown, or the page may\nmiss some data. This occurred on larger pages when the file transfer was chunked, and an invalid HTML entity\nhappened to cross a chunk boundary.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</tr></table> ...

[jsoup](https://github.com/jhy/jsoup) from 1.12.1 to 1.12.2.\n<details>\n<summary>Changelog</summary>\n<p><em>Sourced from <a href=\"https://github.com/jhy/jsoup/blob/master/CHANGES\">jsoup's changelog</a>.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>jsoup changelog</p>\n<p>*** Release 1.13.1 [PENDING]</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: decent memory optimization by not creating Attribute objects for each Element unless/until the Element\ngets an attribute.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: when pretty-printing, comments in inline tags are not pushed to a newline</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: added Attributes#hasValue(key) and Attribute#hasValue(), to check if an attribute is set but has no\nvalue. Useful in place of the deprecated and removed BooleanAttribute class and instanceof test.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Bugfix: in a <select> tag, a second <optgroup> would not automatically close an earlier open <optgroup>\n<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/1313\">jhy/jsoup#1313</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Removed old methods and classes that were marked deprecated in previous releases.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>**** Release 1.12.2 [2020-Feb-08]</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: the :has() selector now supports relative selectors. For example, the query\n&quot;div:has(&gt; a)&quot; will select all &quot;div&quot; elements that have at least one direct child &quot;a&quot; element.\n<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/jhy/jsoup/pull/1214\">jhy/jsoup#1214</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: added Element chaining methods for various overridden methods on Node.\n<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/1193\">jhy/jsoup#1193</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: ensure HTTP keepalives work when fetching content via body() and bodyAsBytes().\n<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/1232\">jhy/jsoup#1232</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: set the default max body size in Jsoup.Connection to 2MB (up from 1MB) so fewer people get trimmed\ncontent if they have not set it, but still in sensible bounds. Also updated the default user-agent to improve\ndefault compatibility.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: dramatic speed improvement when bulk inserting child nodes into an element (wrapping contents).\n<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/1281\">jhy/jsoup#1281</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: added Element#childrenSize() as a convenience to get the size of an element's element children.\n<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/jhy/jsoup/pull/1291\">jhy/jsoup#1291</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: in W3CDom.asString, allow the output mode to be specified as HTML or as XML. It will default to\nchecking the content, and automatically selecting.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: added a Document#documentType() method, to get a doc's doctype.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: To DocumentType, added #name(), #publicID(), and #systemId() methods to fetch those fields.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: in W3CDom conversions from jsoup documents, retain the DocumentType, and be able to serialize it.\n<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/1183\">jhy/jsoup#1183</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Bugfix: on pages fetch by Jsoup.Connection, a &quot;Mark Invalid&quot; exception might be incorrectly thrown, or the page may\nmiss some data. This occurred on larger pages when the file transfer was chunked, and an invalid HTML entity\nhappened to cross a chunk boundary.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</tr></table> ...

[jsoup](https://github.com/jhy/jsoup) from 1.12.1 to 1.12.2.\n<details>\n<summary>Changelog</summary>\n<p><em>Sourced from <a href=\"https://github.com/jhy/jsoup/blob/master/CHANGES\">jsoup's changelog</a>.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>jsoup changelog</p>\n<p>*** Release 1.13.1 [PENDING]</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: decent memory optimization by not creating Attribute objects for each Element unless/until the Element\ngets an attribute.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: when pretty-printing, comments in inline tags are not pushed to a newline</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: added Attributes#hasValue(key) and Attribute#hasValue(), to check if an attribute is set but has no\nvalue. Useful in place of the deprecated and removed BooleanAttribute class and instanceof test.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Bugfix: in a <select> tag, a second <optgroup> would not automatically close an earlier open <optgroup>\n<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/1313\">jhy/jsoup#1313</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Removed old methods and classes that were marked deprecated in previous releases.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>**** Release 1.12.2 [2020-Feb-08]</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: the :has() selector now supports relative selectors. For example, the query\n&quot;div:has(&gt; a)&quot; will select all &quot;div&quot; elements that have at least one direct child &quot;a&quot; element.\n<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/jhy/jsoup/pull/1214\">jhy/jsoup#1214</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: added Element chaining methods for various overridden methods on Node.\n<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/1193\">jhy/jsoup#1193</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: ensure HTTP keepalives work when fetching content via body() and bodyAsBytes().\n<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/1232\">jhy/jsoup#1232</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: set the default max body size in Jsoup.Connection to 2MB (up from 1MB) so fewer people get trimmed\ncontent if they have not set it, but still in sensible bounds. Also updated the default user-agent to improve\ndefault compatibility.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: dramatic speed improvement when bulk inserting child nodes into an element (wrapping contents).\n<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/1281\">jhy/jsoup#1281</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: added Element#childrenSize() as a convenience to get the size of an element's element children.\n<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/jhy/jsoup/pull/1291\">jhy/jsoup#1291</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: in W3CDom.asString, allow the output mode to be specified as HTML or as XML. It will default to\nchecking the content, and automatically selecting.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: added a Document#documentType() method, to get a doc's doctype.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: To DocumentType, added #name(), #publicID(), and #systemId() methods to fetch those fields.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: in W3CDom conversions from jsoup documents, retain the DocumentType, and be able to serialize it.\n<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/1183\">jhy/jsoup#1183</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Bugfix: on pages fetch by Jsoup.Connection, a &quot;Mark Invalid&quot; exception might be incorrectly thrown, or the page may\nmiss some data. This occurred on larger pages when the file transfer was chunked, and an invalid HTML entity\nhappened to cross a chunk boundary.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</tr></table> ...

[jsoup](https://github.com/jhy/jsoup) from 1.12.1 to 1.12.2.\n<details>\n<summary>Changelog</summary>\n<p><em>Sourced from <a href=\"https://github.com/jhy/jsoup/blob/master/CHANGES\">jsoup's changelog</a>.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>jsoup changelog</p>\n<p>*** Release 1.13.1 [PENDING]</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: decent memory optimization by not creating Attribute objects for each Element unless/until the Element\ngets an attribute.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: when pretty-printing, comments in inline tags are not pushed to a newline</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: added Attributes#hasValue(key) and Attribute#hasValue(), to check if an attribute is set but has no\nvalue. Useful in place of the deprecated and removed BooleanAttribute class and instanceof test.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Bugfix: in a <select> tag, a second <optgroup> would not automatically close an earlier open <optgroup>\n<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/1313\">jhy/jsoup#1313</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Removed old methods and classes that were marked deprecated in previous releases.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>**** Release 1.12.2 [2020-Feb-08]</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: the :has() selector now supports relative selectors. For example, the query\n&quot;div:has(&gt; a)&quot; will select all &quot;div&quot; elements that have at least one direct child &quot;a&quot; element.\n<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/jhy/jsoup/pull/1214\">jhy/jsoup#1214</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: added Element chaining methods for various overridden methods on Node.\n<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/1193\">jhy/jsoup#1193</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: ensure HTTP keepalives work when fetching content via body() and bodyAsBytes().\n<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/1232\">jhy/jsoup#1232</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: set the default max body size in Jsoup.Connection to 2MB (up from 1MB) so fewer people get trimmed\ncontent if they have not set it, but still in sensible bounds. Also updated the default user-agent to improve\ndefault compatibility.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: dramatic speed improvement when bulk inserting child nodes into an element (wrapping contents).\n<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/1281\">jhy/jsoup#1281</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: added Element#childrenSize() as a convenience to get the size of an element's element children.\n<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/jhy/jsoup/pull/1291\">jhy/jsoup#1291</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: in W3CDom.asString, allow the output mode to be specified as HTML or as XML. It will default to\nchecking the content, and automatically selecting.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: added a Document#documentType() method, to get a doc's doctype.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: To DocumentType, added #name(), #publicID(), and #systemId() methods to fetch those fields.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: in W3CDom conversions from jsoup documents, retain the DocumentType, and be able to serialize it.\n<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/1183\">jhy/jsoup#1183</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Bugfix: on pages fetch by Jsoup.Connection, a &quot;Mark Invalid&quot; exception might be incorrectly thrown, or the page may\nmiss some data. This occurred on larger pages when the file transfer was chunked, and an invalid HTML entity\nhappened to cross a chunk boundary.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</tr></table> ...

changelog</a>.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>jsoup changelog</p>\n<p>*** Release 1.13.1 [PENDING]</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: decent memory optimization by not creating Attribute objects for each Element unless/until the Element\ngets an attribute.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: when pretty-printing, comments in inline tags are not pushed to a newline</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: added Attributes#hasValue(key) and Attribute#hasValue(), to check if an attribute is set but has no\nvalue. Useful in place of the deprecated and removed BooleanAttribute class and instanceof test.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Bugfix: in a <select> tag, a second <optgroup> would not automatically close an earlier open <optgroup>\n<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/1313\">jhy/jsoup#1313</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Removed old methods and classes that were marked deprecated in previous releases.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>**** Release 1.12.2 [2020-Feb-08]</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: the :has() selector now supports relative selectors. For example, the query\n&quot;div:has(&gt; a)&quot; will select all &quot;div&quot; elements that have at least one direct child &quot;a&quot; element.\n<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/jhy/jsoup/pull/1214\">jhy/jsoup#1214</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: added Element chaining methods for various overridden methods on Node.\n<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/1193\">jhy/jsoup#1193</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: ensure HTTP keepalives work when fetching content via body() and bodyAsBytes().\n<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/1232\">jhy/jsoup#1232</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: set the default max body size in Jsoup.Connection to 2MB (up from 1MB) so fewer people get trimmed\ncontent if they have not set it, but still in sensible bounds. Also updated the default user-agent to improve\ndefault compatibility.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: dramatic speed improvement when bulk inserting child nodes into an element (wrapping contents).\n<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/1281\">jhy/jsoup#1281</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: added Element#childrenSize() as a convenience to get the size of an element's element children.\n<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/jhy/jsoup/pull/1291\">jhy/jsoup#1291</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: in W3CDom.asString, allow the output mode to be specified as HTML or as XML. It will default to\nchecking the content, and automatically selecting.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: added a Document#documentType() method, to get a doc's doctype.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: To DocumentType, added #name(), #publicID(), and #systemId() methods to fetch those fields.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: in W3CDom conversions from jsoup documents, retain the DocumentType, and be able to serialize it.\n<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/1183\">jhy/jsoup#1183</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Bugfix: on pages fetch by Jsoup.Connection, a &quot;Mark Invalid&quot; exception might be incorrectly thrown, or the page may\nmiss some data. This occurred on larger pages when the file transfer was chunked, and an invalid HTML entity\nhappened to cross a chunk boundary.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</tr></table> ...

[jsoup](https://github.com/jhy/jsoup) from 1.12.1 to 1.12.2.\n<details>\n<summary>Changelog</summary>\n<p><em>Sourced from <a href=\"https://github.com/jhy/jsoup/blob/master/CHANGES\">jsoup's changelog</a>.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>jsoup changelog</p>\n<p>*** Release 1.13.1 [PENDING]</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: decent memory optimization by not creating Attribute objects for each Element unless/until the Element\ngets an attribute.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: when pretty-printing, comments in inline tags are not pushed to a newline</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: added Attributes#hasValue(key) and Attribute#hasValue(), to check if an attribute is set but has no\nvalue. Useful in place of the deprecated and removed BooleanAttribute class and instanceof test.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Bugfix: in a <select> tag, a second <optgroup> would not automatically close an earlier open <optgroup>\n<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/1313\">jhy/jsoup#1313</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Removed old methods and classes that were marked deprecated in previous releases.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>**** Release 1.12.2 [2020-Feb-08]</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: the :has() selector now supports relative selectors. For example, the query\n&quot;div:has(&gt; a)&quot; will select all &quot;div&quot; elements that have at least one direct child &quot;a&quot; element.\n<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/jhy/jsoup/pull/1214\">jhy/jsoup#1214</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: added Element chaining methods for various overridden methods on Node.\n<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/1193\">jhy/jsoup#1193</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: ensure HTTP keepalives work when fetching content via body() and bodyAsBytes().\n<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/1232\">jhy/jsoup#1232</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: set the default max body size in Jsoup.Connection to 2MB (up from 1MB) so fewer people get trimmed\ncontent if they have not set it, but still in sensible bounds. Also updated the default user-agent to improve\ndefault compatibility.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: dramatic speed improvement when bulk inserting child nodes into an element (wrapping contents).\n<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/1281\">jhy/jsoup#1281</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: added Element#childrenSize() as a convenience to get the size of an element's element children.\n<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/jhy/jsoup/pull/1291\">jhy/jsoup#1291</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: in W3CDom.asString, allow the output mode to be specified as HTML or as XML. It will default to\nchecking the content, and automatically selecting.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: added a Document#documentType() method, to get a doc's doctype.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: To DocumentType, added #name(), #publicID(), and #systemId() methods to fetch those fields.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: in W3CDom conversions from jsoup documents, retain the DocumentType, and be able to serialize it.\n<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/1183\">jhy/jsoup#1183</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Bugfix: on pages fetch by Jsoup.Connection, a &quot;Mark Invalid&quot; exception might be incorrectly thrown, or the page may\nmiss some data. This occurred on larger pages when the file transfer was chunked, and an invalid HTML entity\nhappened to cross a chunk boundary.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</tr></table> ...

For example, the query\n&quot;div:has(&gt; a)&quot; will select all &quot;div&quot; elements that have at least one direct child &quot;a&quot; element.\n<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/jhy/jsoup/pull/1214\">jhy/jsoup#1214</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: added Element chaining methods for various overridden methods on Node.\n<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/1193\">jhy/jsoup#1193</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: ensure HTTP keepalives work when fetching content via body() and bodyAsBytes().\n<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/1232\">jhy/jsoup#1232</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: set the default max body size in Jsoup.Connection to 2MB (up from 1MB) so fewer people get trimmed\ncontent if they have not set it, but still in sensible bounds. Also updated the default user-agent to improve\ndefault compatibility.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: dramatic speed improvement when bulk inserting child nodes into an element (wrapping contents).\n<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/1281\">jhy/jsoup#1281</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: added Element#childrenSize() as a convenience to get the size of an element's element children.\n<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/jhy/jsoup/pull/1291\">jhy/jsoup#1291</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: in W3CDom.asString, allow the output mode to be specified as HTML or as XML. It will default to\nchecking the content, and automatically selecting.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: added a Document#documentType() method, to get a doc's doctype.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: To DocumentType, added #name(), #publicID(), and #systemId() methods to fetch those fields.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: in W3CDom conversions from jsoup documents, retain the DocumentType, and be able to serialize it.\n<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/1183\">jhy/jsoup#1183</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Bugfix: on pages fetch by Jsoup.Connection, a &quot;Mark Invalid&quot; exception might be incorrectly thrown, or the page may\nmiss some data.

changelog</a>.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>jsoup changelog</p>\n<p>*** Release 1.13.1 [PENDING]</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: decent memory optimization by not creating Attribute objects for each Element unless/until the Element\ngets an attribute.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: when pretty-printing, comments in inline tags are not pushed to a newline</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: added Attributes#hasValue(key) and Attribute#hasValue(), to check if an attribute is set but has no\nvalue. Useful in place of the deprecated and removed BooleanAttribute class and instanceof test.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Bugfix: in a <select> tag, a second <optgroup> would not automatically close an earlier open <optgroup>\n<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/1313\">jhy/jsoup#1313</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Removed old methods and classes that were marked deprecated in previous releases.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>**** Release 1.12.2 [2020-Feb-08]</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: the :has() selector now supports relative selectors. For example, the query\n&quot;div:has(&gt; a)&quot; will select all &quot;div&quot; elements that have at least one direct child &quot;a&quot; element.\n<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/jhy/jsoup/pull/1214\">jhy/jsoup#1214</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: added Element chaining methods for various overridden methods on Node.\n<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/1193\">jhy/jsoup#1193</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: ensure HTTP keepalives work when fetching content via body() and bodyAsBytes().\n<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/1232\">jhy/jsoup#1232</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: set the default max body size in Jsoup.Connection to 2MB (up from 1MB) so fewer people get trimmed\ncontent if they have not set it, but still in sensible bounds. Also updated the default user-agent to improve\ndefault compatibility.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: dramatic speed improvement when bulk inserting child nodes into an element (wrapping contents).\n<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/1281\">jhy/jsoup#1281</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: added Element#childrenSize() as a convenience to get the size of an element's element children.\n<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/jhy/jsoup/pull/1291\">jhy/jsoup#1291</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: in W3CDom.asString, allow the output mode to be specified as HTML or as XML. It will default to\nchecking the content, and automatically selecting.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: added a Document#documentType() method, to get a doc's doctype.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: To DocumentType, added #name(), #publicID(), and #systemId() methods to fetch those fields.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: in W3CDom conversions from jsoup documents, retain the DocumentType, and be able to serialize it.\n<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/1183\">jhy/jsoup#1183</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Bugfix: on pages fetch by Jsoup.Connection, a &quot;Mark Invalid&quot; exception might be incorrectly thrown, or the page may\nmiss some data.

changelog</a>.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>jsoup changelog</p>\n<p>*** Release 1.13.1 [PENDING]</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: decent memory optimization by not creating Attribute objects for each Element unless/until the Element\ngets an attribute.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: when pretty-printing, comments in inline tags are not pushed to a newline</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: added Attributes#hasValue(key) and Attribute#hasValue(), to check if an attribute is set but has no\nvalue. Useful in place of the deprecated and removed BooleanAttribute class and instanceof test.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Bugfix: in a <select> tag, a second <optgroup> would not automatically close an earlier open <optgroup>\n<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/1313\">jhy/jsoup#1313</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Removed old methods and classes that were marked deprecated in previous releases.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>**** Release 1.12.2 [2020-Feb-08]</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: the :has() selector now supports relative selectors. For example, the query\n&quot;div:has(&gt; a)&quot; will select all &quot;div&quot; elements that have at least one direct child &quot;a&quot; element.\n<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/jhy/jsoup/pull/1214\">jhy/jsoup#1214</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: added Element chaining methods for various overridden methods on Node.\n<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/1193\">jhy/jsoup#1193</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: ensure HTTP keepalives work when fetching content via body() and bodyAsBytes().\n<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/1232\">jhy/jsoup#1232</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: set the default max body size in Jsoup.Connection to 2MB (up from 1MB) so fewer people get trimmed\ncontent if they have not set it, but still in sensible bounds. Also updated the default user-agent to improve\ndefault compatibility.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: dramatic speed improvement when bulk inserting child nodes into an element (wrapping contents).\n<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/1281\">jhy/jsoup#1281</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: added Element#childrenSize() as a convenience to get the size of an element's element children.\n<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/jhy/jsoup/pull/1291\">jhy/jsoup#1291</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: in W3CDom.asString, allow the output mode to be specified as HTML or as XML. It will default to\nchecking the content, and automatically selecting.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: added a Document#documentType() method, to get a doc's doctype.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: To DocumentType, added #name(), #publicID(), and #systemId() methods to fetch those fields.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: in W3CDom conversions from jsoup documents, retain the DocumentType, and be able to serialize it.\n<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/1183\">jhy/jsoup#1183</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Bugfix: on pages fetch by Jsoup.Connection, a &quot;Mark Invalid&quot; exception might be incorrectly thrown, or the page may\nmiss some data. This occurred on larger pages when the file transfer was chunked, and an invalid HTML entity\nhappened to cross a chunk boundary.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</tr></table> ...

[jsoup](https://github.com/jhy/jsoup) from 1.11.3 to 1.12.2.\n<details>\n<summary>Changelog</summary>\n<p><em>Sourced from <a href=\"https://github.com/jhy/jsoup/blob/master/CHANGES\">jsoup's changelog</a>.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>jsoup changelog</p>\n<p>*** Release 1.13.1 [PENDING]</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: decent memory optimization by not creating Attribute objects for each Element unless/until the Element\ngets an attribute.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: when pretty-printing, comments in inline tags are not pushed to a newline</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: added Attributes#hasValue(key) and Attribute#hasValue(), to check if an attribute is set but has no\nvalue. Useful in place of the deprecated and removed BooleanAttribute class and instanceof test.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Bugfix: in a <select> tag, a second <optgroup> would not automatically close an earlier open <optgroup>\n<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/1313\">jhy/jsoup#1313</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Removed old methods and classes that were marked deprecated in previous releases.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>**** Release 1.12.2 [2020-Feb-08]</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: the :has() selector now supports relative selectors. For example, the query\n&quot;div:has(&gt; a)&quot; will select all &quot;div&quot; elements that have at least one direct child &quot;a&quot; element.\n<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/jhy/jsoup/pull/1214\">jhy/jsoup#1214</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: added Element chaining methods for various overridden methods on Node.\n<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/1193\">jhy/jsoup#1193</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: ensure HTTP keepalives work when fetching content via body() and bodyAsBytes().\n<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/1232\">jhy/jsoup#1232</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: set the default max body size in Jsoup.Connection to 2MB (up from 1MB) so fewer people get trimmed\ncontent if they have not set it, but still in sensible bounds. Also updated the default user-agent to improve\ndefault compatibility.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: dramatic speed improvement when bulk inserting child nodes into an element (wrapping contents).\n<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/1281\">jhy/jsoup#1281</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: added Element#childrenSize() as a convenience to get the size of an element's element children.\n<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/jhy/jsoup/pull/1291\">jhy/jsoup#1291</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: in W3CDom.asString, allow the output mode to be specified as HTML or as XML. It will default to\nchecking the content, and automatically selecting.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: added a Document#documentType() method, to get a doc's doctype.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: To DocumentType, added #name(), #publicID(), and #systemId() methods to fetch those fields.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: in W3CDom conversions from jsoup documents, retain the DocumentType, and be able to serialize it.\n<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/1183\">jhy/jsoup#1183</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Bugfix: on pages fetch by Jsoup.Connection, a &quot;Mark Invalid&quot; exception might be incorrectly thrown, or the page may\nmiss some data. This occurred on larger pages when the file transfer was chunked, and an invalid HTML entity\nhappened to cross a chunk boundary.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</tr></table> ...

[jsoup](https://github.com/jhy/jsoup) from 1.12.1 to 1.12.2.\n<details>\n<summary>Changelog</summary>\n<p><em>Sourced from <a href=\"https://github.com/jhy/jsoup/blob/master/CHANGES\">jsoup's changelog</a>.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>jsoup changelog</p>\n<p>*** Release 1.13.1 [PENDING]</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: decent memory optimization by not creating Attribute objects for each Element unless/until the Element\ngets an attribute.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: when pretty-printing, comments in inline tags are not pushed to a newline</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: added Attributes#hasValue(key) and Attribute#hasValue(), to check if an attribute is set but has no\nvalue. Useful in place of the deprecated and removed BooleanAttribute class and instanceof test.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Bugfix: in a <select> tag, a second <optgroup> would not automatically close an earlier open <optgroup>\n<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/1313\">jhy/jsoup#1313</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Removed old methods and classes that were marked deprecated in previous releases.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>**** Release 1.12.2 [2020-Feb-08]</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: the :has() selector now supports relative selectors. For example, the query\n&quot;div:has(&gt; a)&quot; will select all &quot;div&quot; elements that have at least one direct child &quot;a&quot; element.\n<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/jhy/jsoup/pull/1214\">jhy/jsoup#1214</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: added Element chaining methods for various overridden methods on Node.\n<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/1193\">jhy/jsoup#1193</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: ensure HTTP keepalives work when fetching content via body() and bodyAsBytes().\n<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/1232\">jhy/jsoup#1232</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: set the default max body size in Jsoup.Connection to 2MB (up from 1MB) so fewer people get trimmed\ncontent if they have not set it, but still in sensible bounds. Also updated the default user-agent to improve\ndefault compatibility.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: dramatic speed improvement when bulk inserting child nodes into an element (wrapping contents).\n<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/1281\">jhy/jsoup#1281</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: added Element#childrenSize() as a convenience to get the size of an element's element children.\n<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/jhy/jsoup/pull/1291\">jhy/jsoup#1291</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: in W3CDom.asString, allow the output mode to be specified as HTML or as XML. It will default to\nchecking the content, and automatically selecting.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: added a Document#documentType() method, to get a doc's doctype.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: To DocumentType, added #name(), #publicID(), and #systemId() methods to fetch those fields.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: in W3CDom conversions from jsoup documents, retain the DocumentType, and be able to serialize it.\n<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/1183\">jhy/jsoup#1183</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Bugfix: on pages fetch by Jsoup.Connection, a &quot;Mark Invalid&quot; exception might be incorrectly thrown, or the page may\nmiss some data. This occurred on larger pages when the file transfer was chunked, and an invalid HTML entity\nhappened to cross a chunk boundary.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</tr></table> ...

changelog</a>.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>jsoup changelog</p>\n<p>*** Release 1.13.1 [PENDING]</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: decent memory optimization by not creating Attribute objects for each Element unless/until the Element\ngets an attribute.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: when pretty-printing, comments in inline tags are not pushed to a newline</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: added Attributes#hasValue(key) and Attribute#hasValue(), to check if an attribute is set but has no\nvalue. Useful in place of the deprecated and removed BooleanAttribute class and instanceof test.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Bugfix: in a <select> tag, a second <optgroup> would not automatically close an earlier open <optgroup>\n<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/1313\">jhy/jsoup#1313</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Removed old methods and classes that were marked deprecated in previous releases.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>**** Release 1.12.2 [2020-Feb-08]</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: the :has() selector now supports relative selectors. For example, the query\n&quot;div:has(&gt; a)&quot; will select all &quot;div&quot; elements that have at least one direct child &quot;a&quot; element.\n<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/jhy/jsoup/pull/1214\">jhy/jsoup#1214</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: added Element chaining methods for various overridden methods on Node.\n<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/1193\">jhy/jsoup#1193</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: ensure HTTP keepalives work when fetching content via body() and bodyAsBytes().\n<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/1232\">jhy/jsoup#1232</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: set the default max body size in Jsoup.Connection to 2MB (up from 1MB) so fewer people get trimmed\ncontent if they have not set it, but still in sensible bounds. Also updated the default user-agent to improve\ndefault compatibility.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: dramatic speed improvement when bulk inserting child nodes into an element (wrapping contents).\n<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/1281\">jhy/jsoup#1281</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: added Element#childrenSize() as a convenience to get the size of an element's element children.\n<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/jhy/jsoup/pull/1291\">jhy/jsoup#1291</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: in W3CDom.asString, allow the output mode to be specified as HTML or as XML. It will default to\nchecking the content, and automatically selecting.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: added a Document#documentType() method, to get a doc's doctype.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: To DocumentType, added #name(), #publicID(), and #systemId() methods to fetch those fields.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: in W3CDom conversions from jsoup documents, retain the DocumentType, and be able to serialize it.\n<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/1183\">jhy/jsoup#1183</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Bugfix: on pages fetch by Jsoup.Connection, a &quot;Mark Invalid&quot; exception might be incorrectly thrown, or the page may\nmiss some data. This occurred on larger pages when the file transfer was chunked, and an invalid HTML entity\nhappened to cross a chunk boundary.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</tr></table> ...

changelog</a>.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>jsoup changelog</p>\n<p>*** Release 1.13.1 [PENDING]</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: decent memory optimization by not creating Attribute objects for each Element unless/until the Element\ngets an attribute.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: when pretty-printing, comments in inline tags are not pushed to a newline</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: added Attributes#hasValue(key) and Attribute#hasValue(), to check if an attribute is set but has no\nvalue. Useful in place of the deprecated and removed BooleanAttribute class and instanceof test.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Bugfix: in a <select> tag, a second <optgroup> would not automatically close an earlier open <optgroup>\n<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/1313\">jhy/jsoup#1313</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Removed old methods and classes that were marked deprecated in previous releases.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>**** Release 1.12.2 [2020-Feb-08]</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: the :has() selector now supports relative selectors. For example, the query\n&quot;div:has(&gt; a)&quot; will select all &quot;div&quot; elements that have at least one direct child &quot;a&quot; element.\n<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/jhy/jsoup/pull/1214\">jhy/jsoup#1214</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: added Element chaining methods for various overridden methods on Node.\n<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/1193\">jhy/jsoup#1193</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: ensure HTTP keepalives work when fetching content via body() and bodyAsBytes().\n<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/1232\">jhy/jsoup#1232</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: set the default max body size in Jsoup.Connection to 2MB (up from 1MB) so fewer people get trimmed\ncontent if they have not set it, but still in sensible bounds. Also updated the default user-agent to improve\ndefault compatibility.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: dramatic speed improvement when bulk inserting child nodes into an element (wrapping contents).\n<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/1281\">jhy/jsoup#1281</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: added Element#childrenSize() as a convenience to get the size of an element's element children.\n<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/jhy/jsoup/pull/1291\">jhy/jsoup#1291</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: in W3CDom.asString, allow the output mode to be specified as HTML or as XML. It will default to\nchecking the content, and automatically selecting.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: added a Document#documentType() method, to get a doc's doctype.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: To DocumentType, added #name(), #publicID(), and #systemId() methods to fetch those fields.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: in W3CDom conversions from jsoup documents, retain the DocumentType, and be able to serialize it.\n<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/1183\">jhy/jsoup#1183</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Bugfix: on pages fetch by Jsoup.Connection, a &quot;Mark Invalid&quot; exception might be incorrectly thrown, or the page may\nmiss some data. This occurred on larger pages when the file transfer was chunked, and an invalid HTML entity\nhappened to cross a chunk boundary.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</tr></table> ...
