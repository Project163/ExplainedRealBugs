What browsers have you seen it behave differently in?\n\nI'm not sure what the best thing to do is with this -- I think I prefer to keep to the way browsers handle it. Titles are parsed as rawdata where &lt; symbols have no special meaning, so e.g. a &lt;/head&gt; is actually valid. \n\nOne fixup method might be to confirm that the doc does have a closing title tag, and if it doesn't, hop out of rawdata mode and ignore the title tag contents. But that would involve a big lookahead on each new title tag, which isn't ideal.\n","author_association":"OWNER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jhy/jsoup/issues/comments/1265100/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"jhy","id":76934,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc2OTM0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/76934?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy","html_url":"https://github.com/jhy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":928459,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDkyODQ1OQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jhy/jsoup/issues/events/928459","actor":{"login":"jhy","id":76934,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc2OTM0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/76934?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy","html_url":"https://github.com/jhy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2011-05-31T05:44:38Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":999842,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50OTk5ODQy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jhy/jsoup/issues/events/999842","actor":{"login":"jhy","id":76934,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc2OTM0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/76934?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy","html_url":"https://github.com/jhy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":"5f18c95204ca6b4c7818d3d007cf820aad2e3337","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jhy/jsoup/commits/5f18c95204ca6b4c7818d3d007cf820aad2e3337","created_at":"2011-06-03T15:02:50Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":1736652,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDE3MzY2NTI=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jhy/jsoup/issues/events/1736652","actor":{"login":"michael-simons","id":526383,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyNjM4Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/526383?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/michael-simons","html_url":"https://github.com/michael-simons","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michael-simons/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michael-simons/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michael-simons/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michael-simons/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michael-simons/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michael-simons/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michael-simons/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michael-simons/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michael-simons/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"437d8eca9f51dd0ed7af5b828412ee96ac192f17","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/michael-simons/jsoup/commits/437d8eca9f51dd0ed7af5b828412ee96ac192f17","created_at":"2011-07-12T14:45:15Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
