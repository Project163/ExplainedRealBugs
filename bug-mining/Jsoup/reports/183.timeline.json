changelog</a>.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>jsoup changelog</p>\n<p>*** Release 1.13.1 [PENDING]</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: when pretty-printing, comments in inline tags are not pushed to a newline</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Removed old methods and classes that were marked deprecated in previous releases.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>**** Release 1.12.2 [2020-Feb-08]</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: the :has() selector now supports relative selectors. For example, the query\n&quot;div:has(&gt; a)&quot; will select all &quot;div&quot; elements that have at least one direct child &quot;a&quot; element.\n<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/jhy/jsoup/pull/1214\">jhy/jsoup#1214</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Bugfix: in a <select> tag, a second <optgroup> would not automatically close an earlier open <optgroup>\n<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/1313\">jhy/jsoup#1313</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: added Element chaining methods for various overridden methods on Node.\n<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/1193\">jhy/jsoup#1193</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: ensure HTTP keepalives work when fetching content via body() and bodyAsBytes().\n<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/1232\">jhy/jsoup#1232</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: set the default max body size in Jsoup.Connection to 2MB (up from 1MB) so fewer people get trimmed\ncontent if they have not set it, but still in sensible bounds. Also updated the default user-agent to improve\ndefault compatibility.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: dramatic speed improvement when bulk inserting child nodes into an element (wrapping contents).\n<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/1281\">jhy/jsoup#1281</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: added Element#childrenSize() as a convenience to get the size of an element's element children.\n<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/jhy/jsoup/pull/1291\">jhy/jsoup#1291</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: in W3CDom.asString, allow the output mode to be specified as HTML or as XML. It will default to\nchecking the content, and automatically selecting.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: added a Document#documentType() method, to get a doc's doctype.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: To DocumentType, added #name(), #publicID(), and #systemId() methods to fetch those fields.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: in W3CDom conversions from jsoup documents, retain the DocumentType, and be able to serialize it.\n<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/1183\">jhy/jsoup#1183</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Bugfix: on pages fetch by Jsoup.Connection, a &quot;Mark Invalid&quot; exception might be incorrectly thrown, or the page may\nmiss some data. This occurred on larger pages when the file transfer was chunked, and an invalid HTML entity\nhappened to cross a chunk boundary.\n<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/1218\">jhy/jsoup#1218</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Bugfix: if duplicate attributes in an element exist, retain the first vs the last attribute with the same name. Case\naware (HTML case-insensitive names, XML are case-sensitive).\n<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/1219\">jhy/jsoup#1219</a></p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</tr></table> ...

have an issue with form-elements that contains duplicate attributes. I was expecting that attributes in form-elements should be deduplicated in the same way as all other elements when parsing HTML via Parser.htmlParser() but duplicate attributes seems to always be retained. Using Parser.xmlParser(), form attributes are correctly deduplicated so the issue only affects HTML.\r\n\r\nLooking though old issues and pull requests, I found #1219 that seems to fix deduplication for start tags but that fix doesn't seems to apply to form-elements.\r\n\r\nHere is a simple test-case adopted from `HtmlParserTest`:\r\n\r\n```\r\n    @Test public void dropsDuplicateAttributesInFormElement() {\r\n        String html = \"<form One=One ONE=Two Two=two one=Three One=Four two=Five></form>\";\r\n        Parser parser = Parser.htmlParser().setTrackErrors(10);\r\n        Document doc = parser.parseInput(html, \"\");\r\n\r\n        Element p = doc.selectFirst(\"form\");\r\n        assertEquals(\"<form one=\\\"One\\\" two=\\\"two\\\"></form>\", p.outerHtml()); // normalized names due to lower casing\r\n\r\n        assertEquals(1, parser.getErrors().size());\r\n        assertEquals(\"Dropped duplicate attribute(s) in tag [form]\", parser.getErrors().get(0).getErrorMessage());\r\n    }\r\n```","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jhy/jsoup/issues/1949/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jhy/jsoup/issues/1949/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":12942220432,"node_id":"REFE_lADOAAbAPs4apqTwzwAAAAMDapyQ","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jhy/jsoup/issues/events/12942220432","actor":{"login":"winning1120xx","id":6879244,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4NzkyNDQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6879244?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/winning1120xx","html_url":"https://github.com/winning1120xx","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/winning1120xx/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/winning1120xx/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/winning1120xx/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/winning1120xx/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/winning1120xx/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/winning1120xx/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/winning1120xx/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/winning1120xx/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/winning1120xx/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"0fc3d6728ae270fb38f9778ad7fa2663060b50c7","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/winning1120xx/jsoup/commits/0fc3d6728ae270fb38f9778ad7fa2663060b50c7","created_at":"2024-05-27T08:08:06Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
