another look at this and somewhat related #576. I think we can address this, make some improvements, and also maintain backwards compatibility:\r\n\r\n - for `:contains(text)`, normalize the selector text in the same way that the `text() ` and `ownText()` methods work. That directly fixes this issue. I conceptually like the neatness of using `:contains(\"text\")` to use a non-normalized search, but that's a bit stringly typed, and maybe backwards in-compat.\r\n - introduce something like `:containsWhole` and :containsOwnWhole which uses `wholeText()` and no normalization to either the input or the query. That way we can find content including newlines, tabs, repeated spaces, etc\r\n - for #576, introduce `:matchesWhole` and `:matchesOwnWhole`, to work similarly for regular expressions","author_association":"OWNER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jhy/jsoup/issues/comments/922231024/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"jhy","id":76934,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc2OTM0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/76934?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy","html_url":"https://github.com/jhy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"actor":{"login":"jhy","id":76934,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc2OTM0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/76934?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy","html_url":"https://github.com/jhy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-09-18T07:15:43Z","updated_at":"2021-09-18T07:15:43Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jhy/jsoup/issues/576","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jhy/jsoup","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jhy/jsoup/issues/576/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jhy/jsoup/issues/576/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jhy/jsoup/issues/576/events","html_url":"https://github.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/576","id":77830852,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU3NzgzMDg1Mg==","number":576,"title":"Can't select elements with only whitespace","user":{"login":"ks280first","id":9662677,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk2NjI2Nzc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9662677?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ks280first","html_url":"https://github.com/ks280first","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ks280first/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ks280first/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ks280first/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ks280first/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ks280first/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ks280first/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ks280first/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ks280first/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ks280first/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":623963149,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw2MjM5NjMxNDk=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jhy/jsoup/labels/fixed","name":"fixed","color":"7BE482","default":false,"description":"An {bug|improvement} that has been {fixed|implemented}"}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jhy/jsoup/milestones/19","html_url":"https://github.com/jhy/jsoup/milestone/19","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jhy/jsoup/milestones/19/labels","id":6216969,"node_id":"MDk6TWlsZXN0b25lNjIxNjk2OQ==","number":19,"title":"1.15.1","description":"A planned future version of jsoup.

reviewing #876 and the related #576. I think we can make some improvements, and also maintain backwards compatibility:\r\n\r\n - (**done**)  for `:contains(text)`, normalize the selector text in the same way that the `text() ` and `ownText()` methods work. That directly fixes this issue. I conceptually like the neatness of using `:contains(\"text\")` to use a non-normalized search, but that's a bit stringly typed, and maybe backwards in-compat.\r\n - (**done**)  introduce `:containsWholeText` and :containsWholeOwnText which uses `wholeText()` and `wholeOwnText()` and no normalization to either the input or the query. That way we can find content including newlines, tabs, repeated spaces, etc\r\n - (**done**) for #576, introduce `:matchesWholeText` and `:matchesWholeOwnText`, to work similarly for regular expressions\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jhy/jsoup/issues/1636/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jhy/jsoup/issues/1636/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":5322709480,"node_id":"LE_lADOAAbAPs4NZaWCzwAAAAE9Qhno","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jhy/jsoup/issues/events/5322709480","actor":{"login":"jhy","id":76934,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc2OTM0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/76934?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy","html_url":"https://github.com/jhy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-09-18T08:40:53Z","label":{"name":"fixed","color":"c2e0c6"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":5322709524,"node_id":"MIE_lADOAAbAPs4NZaWCzwAAAAE9QhoU","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jhy/jsoup/issues/events/5322709524","actor":{"login":"jhy","id":76934,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc2OTM0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/76934?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy","html_url":"https://github.com/jhy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"milestoned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-09-18T08:40:56Z","milestone":{"title":"1.14.3"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":5322709877,"node_id":"CE_lADOAAbAPs4NZaWCzwAAAAE9Qht1","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jhy/jsoup/issues/events/5322709877","actor":{"login":"jhy","id":76934,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc2OTM0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/76934?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy","html_url":"https://github.com/jhy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-09-18T08:41:25Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
