A few days ago, one of these sites updated their website, and introduced a bug, causing our crawling to fail spectacularly. The HTML which was broken looked a bit like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\n<td class=\"my-cell\"\r\n   <div class=\"great-formatting\">100</div>\r\n</td>\r\n```\r\n\r\nAs you can see, the TD is missing a closing `>`, while we did a `document.select(\"div.great-formatting\")`. This failed, because Jsoup couldn't parse the document correctly anymore. \r\n\r\nI understand it's a very edge case, and maybe very hard to fix. However, for us it was a production issue, and caused us quite a few headaches. Right now, we have a sort of preprocessor running over the HTML to close all elements which should be closed, but it would be much nicer if Jsoup would handle this out of the box. \r\n","closed_by":{"login":"jhy","id":76934,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc2OTM0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/76934?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy","html_url":"https://github.com/jhy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jhy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jhy/jsoup/issues/797/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jhy/jsoup/issues/797/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
