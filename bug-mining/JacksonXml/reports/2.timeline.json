having some issues deserializing a class that uses a @JacksonXmlElementWrapper.\n\nThis how my class looks:\n\n``` java\n@JacksonXmlRootElement( localName = \"person\", namespace =\"http://example.org/person\" )\npublic class Person\n{\n   @JacksonXmlProperty( isAttribute = true )\n   private String id;\n\n   private String name;\n\n   private Integer age;\n\n   @JacksonXmlElementWrapper(localName = \"notes\")\n   @JacksonXmlProperty( localName = \"note\" )\n   private List<String> notes = new ArrayList<String>();\n\n  // getters, setters, etc\n}\n```\n\nAnd this gets serialized fine with:\n\n``` java\nPerson p = new Person( \"Name\", 30 );\np.getNotes().add( \"This is note #1\" );\np.getNotes().add( \"This is note #2\" );\n\nObjectMapper xmlMapper = new XmlMapper();\nString xml = xmlMapper.writeValueAsString( p );\n```\n\nThis gives me something like:\n\n``` xml\n<zdef-1759520061:person xmlns=\"\"\nxmlns:zdef-1759520061=\"http://example.org/person\"\nid=\"af47ac8e-ee8c-4e43-a87c-dbff93f28d87\">\n <name>Name</name>\n <age>30</age>\n <notes>\n   <note>This is note #1</note>\n   <note>This is note #2</note>\n </notes>\n</zdef-1759520061:person>\n```\n\nBut, when I now try and deserialize this using:\n\n``` java\nPerson p = xmlMapper.readValue( xml, Person.class );\n```\n\nI
