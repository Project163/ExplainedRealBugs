The issue can also be found on SO: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/33722369/jackson-xml-deserializing-empty-classes-and-polymorphism\n\nThe problem happens both with JAXB and Jackson XML annotations. I pasted the XML example below:\n\n``` java\npublic static class Data {\n    @XmlElement(name = \"name\")\n    private String name;\n    @XmlElements({\n            @XmlElement(type = EmptyProxy.class, name = \"empty\")\n    })\n    private Proxy  proxy;\n}\n\npublic interface Proxy {\n}\n\n@XmlType(name = \"empty\")\npublic static class EmptyProxy implements Proxy {\n}\n\npublic static void main(String[] a) throws IOException {\n    final ObjectMapper mapper = new XmlMapper()/*.registerModule(new JacksonXmlModule())*/.registerModule(new JaxbAnnotationModule());\n    final Data data = mapper.readValue(\"<data><name>my-name</name><proxy><empty></empty></proxy></data>\", Data.class);\n}\n```\n\nThis gives the following exeption:\n\n```\nException in thread \"main\" com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.JsonMappingException: Can not deserialize instance of Test$EmptyProxy out of VALUE_NULL token\n at [Source: java.io.StringReader@27c20538; line: 1, column: 49] (through reference chain: Data[\"proxy\"])\n    at com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.JsonMappingException.from(JsonMappingException.java:148)\n```\n","closed_by":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder","html_url":"https://github.com/cowtowncoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-dataformat-xml/issues/169/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-dataformat-xml/issues/169/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
