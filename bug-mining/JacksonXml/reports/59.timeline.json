Never rely on context classloader,\r\n2. Usually class loading another class should use ClassLoader that loaded it, and\r\n3. If class that does loading does it on behalf of someone else, it should take in `ClassLoader`\r\n\r\nall of which is to say that yeah #480 makes sense. I think what I'll do for 2.13 is along these lines so that\r\n\r\n1. Default behavior will be to use `ClassLoader` of `XmlInputFactory` (or whichever local class calls Stax factory method)\r\n2. Allow passing `ClassLoader` through `XmlFactoryBuilder`, to let caller change it as it sees fit.\r\n\r\nWhile (2) is sort of optional in the sense that caller could as well as handle instantiation it is not a lot of code to add and might make it easier for users to realize potential issues and (in case they hit issues first) find solution(s).\r\nJavadocs for the config method should state that there is the alternative way of simply passing factories directly.\r\n\r\n@timja @jglick

Please describe.**\r\nA clear and concise description of what the problem is. Ex. I'm always frustrated when [...]\r\n\r\nIn an application where the current Threads context class loader is not the main class loader I am unable to load the required stax implementation required by jackson-xml-databind. The one bundled in the JDK is incompatible.\r\n\r\nIn normal situations I would pass by expected classloader down to whatever is doing the classloading, unfortunately jackson-databind-xml doesn't expose a method for that although the [JDK does](https://github.com/AdoptOpenJDK/openjdk-jdk8u/blob/64cc2bc73816f3e0a91776805482fee37fa37bbe/jaxp/src/javax/xml/stream/XMLInputFactory.java#L287), [jackson-constructor](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-dataformat-xml/blob/75d9056bf344d2c18192eb128f177ee21a586017/src/main/java/com/fasterxml/jackson/dataformat/xml/XmlFactory.java#L113)\r\n\r\nIt does provide constructors for an already configured `XmlFactory`, if I could pass that to the `JacksonAdapter` in some way then that would solve my problem, (would be passed to the `builder` instead of it creating one) https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-java/blob/main/sdk/core/azure-core/src/main/java/com/azure/core/util/serializer/JacksonAdapter.java#L137\r\n\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nA supported API for providing either my classloader for loading the `XMLInputFactory` or providing a precreated `XmlFactory`\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\n\r\n* There's work in progress to try hack this by setting the thread context classloader, but it's brittle work and leads to very ugly code, https://github.com/jenkinsci/azure-storage-plugin/pull/195\r\n\r\n* Allowing me to pass a custom classloader would be better all round, I've raised a PR to jackson to see if they'll take that PR: https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-dataformat-xml/pull/480\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nAdd any other context or screenshots about the feature request here.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/jenkinsci/jackson2-api-plugin/pull/82#issuecomment-873264276\r\nhttps://github.com/jenkinsci/azure-storage-plugin/issues/194\r\nhttps://github.com/jenkinsci/azure-storage-plugin/issues/188\r\n\r\n**Information Checklist**\r\nKindly make sure that you have added all the following information above and checkoff the required fields otherwise we will treat the issuer as an incomplete report\r\n- [ ] Description

fix for https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-dataformat-xml/issues/483 introduced a regression for applications using only the built-in JDK XML support.\r\n\r\nBefore this change, the code did this:\r\n```\r\n            xmlIn = XMLInputFactory.newInstance();\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter this change, the code does this:\r\n```\r\n            // 05-Jul-2021, tatu: as per [dataformat-xml#483], specify ClassLoader\r\n            xmlIn = XMLInputFactory.newFactory(XMLInputFactory.class.getName(),\r\n                    getClass().getClassLoader());\r\n```\r\n\r\nA similar change applies to the `XMLOutputFactory`.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately if you look at the JDK's implementation of these methods, the one taking zero arguments (old code) will fall back to the built-in implementation whereas the one accepting arguments (new code) does not perform the fallback.\r\n\r\nMy preference would be to revert this change, not just because it would fix this problem for me but because I believe the original code was actually correct and the new code is not.  Why should only XML libraries on whatever ClassLoader is hosting Jackson be considered?  Shouldn't the caller be able to control what library is used in the default constructor by controlling the context ClassLoader?\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, a caller wishing to use the XML support of a specific ClassLoader, be it Jackson's ClassLoader or another, is already free to make the call to XMLInputFactory and XMLOutputFactory itself, passing in the specific objects to use.  Or that caller could instead simply set their ContextClassLoader appropriately and the default constructor would do what they want.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-dataformat-xml/issues/550/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-dataformat-xml/issues/550/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
