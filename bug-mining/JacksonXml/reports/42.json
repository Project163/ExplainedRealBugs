refer to http://stackoverflow.com/questions/20673153/using-jackson-to-deserialize-a-collection-of-children-with-the-same-type-as-the\n\nI can not figure out how to deserialize a document like this:\n\n```\n<test id=\"0\">\n    <test id=\"0.1\">\n        <test id=\"0.1.1\" />\n    </test>\n    <test id=\"0.2\" />\n    <test id=\"0.3\">\n        <test id=\"0.3.1\" />\n

Exception {\n    final ObjectMapper mapper = new XmlMapper();\n\n    final XmlTest before =\n        new XmlTest(\"0\", Lists.newArrayList(new XmlTest(\"0.1\", null),\n            new XmlTest(\"0.2\", Lists.newArrayList(new XmlTest(\"0.2.1\", null)))));\n    final String xml = mapper.writeValueAsString(before);\n    System.out.println(xml);\n    final XmlTest after = mapper.readValue(xml, XmlTest.class);\n  }\n\n  @JacksonXmlRootElement(localName = \"test\")\n  public static class XmlTest {\n    @JacksonXmlProperty(localName = \"id\", isAttribute = true)\n    private String id;\n
