Refuse to use one without automatic namespaces enabled (throw exception)\r\n2. Enable feature automatically\r\n3. Add functionality in XML mapper to do what automatic namespaces does, tracking bindings, adding necessary ones.\r\n\r\nProblem with first one is that Stax specification defines default to be this feature disabled, so many users would probably be surprised, and then have to enable it, small but unnecessary (to them) extra task.\r\n\r\nProblem with third one is that this is a lot of extra functionality to write -- and something Stax XMLStreamWriter already implements.\r\n\r\nSo I think going with (2), enabling it, makes most sense.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder","html_url":"https://github.com/cowtowncoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-dataformat-xml/issues/326/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-dataformat-xml/issues/326/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
