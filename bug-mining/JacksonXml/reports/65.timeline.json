Some notes:\r\n\r\n1. The issue is related to empty (root) element; taken to mean \"Empty String\" as content -- passing, `<problem><status>500</status></problem>`, for example, would work\r\n2. Probably related to improvements aimed at making it possible to read such empty elements as \"empty\" POJOs. But the issue here is either use of non-default constructor (which ought to be fine of course), or, perhaps, polymorphic handling.\r\n3. Work-around on short term would be adding the default constructor (need not be public) -- that will get called ok, I tested it.\r\n\r\nSo while I will try to address this, I would suggest adding such constructor for this specific case, to work-around the problem.\r\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-dataformat-xml/issues/comments/912878235/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder","html_url":"https://github.com/cowtowncoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":5255986317,"node_id":"UNLE_lADOABJ3ss46bVWxzwAAAAE5R_yN","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-dataformat-xml/issues/events/5255986317","actor":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder","html_url":"https://github.com/cowtowncoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"unlabeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-09-04T02:36:17Z","label":{"name":"2.13","color":"0e8a16"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":5255986319,"node_id":"LE_lADOABJ3ss46bVWxzwAAAAE5R_yP","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-dataformat-xml/issues/events/5255986319","actor":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder","html_url":"https://github.com/cowtowncoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-09-04T02:36:17Z","label":{"name":"2.14","color":"B3CC56"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-dataformat-xml/issues/comments/912894153","html_url":"https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-dataformat-xml/issues/491#issuecomment-912894153","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-dataformat-xml/issues/491","id":912894153,"node_id":"IC_kwDOABJ3ss42aajJ","user":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder","html_url":"https://github.com/cowtowncoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/repos","events_url":"

I added some notes on the failing test. This is not an easy problem to solve; basically there seems to be 2 ways to work around it. Either:\r\n\r\n1. Change interpretation of `<root></root>` (empty element) to produce `START_OBJECT` / `END_OBJECT` pair (instead of `VALUE_STRING`). This would likely cause other regression, but is a possibility.\r\n2. Change `StdDeserializer` handling of \"empty value\" to allow use of Properties-based Creator, passing \"all absent\" values. Actually code goes to `BeanDeserializerBase.getEmptyValue()`, which is where this would need to be done.\r\n\r\nOf these (2) would work better and would probably be the way to go. I don't have time to pursue this quite now, but wanted to add a note if anyone else might want to try it.\r\n\r\nOther than this, adding the no-arguments constructor also works around the
