time, current behavior is not good either.\r\n\r\nOne thing that seems doable is catching of the exception and attempting secondary lookup with no-args method.\r\nI think I'd like to go with that.\r\n\r\nOne immediate challenge here is testing, however; due to the way Stax implementation lookup works, if any implementation is in the classpath it will be found so test would specifically require use of a very bare-bones project.\r\nSince this repo is not a multi-maven-module one it seems impossible to add a basic unit test -- unless I am missing some obvious way to achieve suitable set up.\r\n\r\n@dfelliott Do you think you could come up with a PR here?
