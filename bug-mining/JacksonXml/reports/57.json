defined above.\r\n  mapper.readValue(campaignXmlStr, Campaign.class);\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe above JSON gets deserialized into the bean with the `cost` property being set to `null`.\r\n\r\nWith version `2.12.x` the `cost` property becomes integer `0`\r\n\r\nI reviewed the release notes and didn't notice any breaking change listed in behavior.
