Search before asking\n\n- [x] I searched in the [issues](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues) and found nothing similar.\n\n([#237](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/237) describes FAIL_ON_READING_DUP_TREE_KEY )\n\n### Describe the bug\n\nWhen mapping to a non-list, like a string, I expect to get an exception, when there is a duplicate value. As it is, the first value just disappears, with no possibility to even know there was something wrong to begin with. As it stands, \"FAIL_ON_READING_DUP_TREE_KEY\" only picks up on duplicate Attributes, which is already broken XML to begin with. \n\nexample: \n```xml\n<myXml>\n    <value>aaa</value>\n    <value>bbb</value>\n</myXml> ```\n\nwith this class \n```kotlin\ndata class MyXml(val value: String)\n```\n\nhere MyXml.value receives a duplicate value, which FAIL_ON_READING_DUP_TREE_KEY will not detect. \n\n\n\nI think the solution would either to add this to the \"known limitation\" section in the readme, or to fix the bug. \n\nIs there a workaround for this bug, so that I can find out, when multiple values gets mapped to the same property? (And no, I don't want to turn every single property into a list, and then manually check if size<=1. But maybe there is something like a global flag, that adds a custom setter to all properties, that checks if there was already a value? Or maybe there is some way to add a custom Feature to add this check?)\n\n### Version Information\n\n2.18.2\n\n### Reproduction\n\n```kotlin\nimport com.fasterxml.jackson.core.JsonParser\nimport com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.DeserializationFeature\nimport com.fasterxml.jackson.dataformat.xml.XmlMapper\nimport com.fasterxml.jackson.module.kotlin.kotlinModule\nimport org.testng.annotations.Test\nimport kotlin.test.assertEquals\ndata class MyXml(val value: String)\n\nclass DuplicateTest {\n\n    @Test(expectedExceptions = [com.fasterxml.jackson.core.JsonParseException::class])\n    fun duplicateNodeTestWorksWithAttributes() {\n        val mapper = XmlMapper.builder().addModule(kotlinModule()).enable(DeserializationFeature.FAIL_ON_READING_DUP_TREE_KEY).enable(JsonParser.Feature.STRICT_DUPLICATE_DETECTION).build()\n        mapper.readValue(\"\"\"<myXml value=\"aaa\" value=\"bbb\" />\"\"\", MyXml::class.java)\n    }\n    \n    @Test(expectedExceptions = [com.fasterxml.jackson.core.JsonParseException::class]) \n    fun duplicateNodeTestDoesntWorkWithChildren() {\n        val mapper = XmlMapper.builder().addModule(kotlinModule()).enable(DeserializationFeature.FAIL_ON_READING_DUP_TREE_KEY).enable(JsonParser.Feature.STRICT_DUPLICATE_DETECTION).build()\n        val result = mapper.readValue(\"\"\"<myXml>\n                    <value>aaa</value>\n                    <value>bbb</value>\n                </myXml> \"\"\", MyXml::class.java)\n\n        assertEquals(\"bbb\", result.value)\n        assertEquals(\"aaa\", result.value)\n    }\n}\n``` \n\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nI expect \"STRICT_DUPLICATE_DETECTION\" to give me an exception, whenever an existing value gets overwritten, and if the target-property is no list.  \n\n### Additional context\n\nI am no jackson-XML professional, so odds are, that I overlooked something obvious. I that is the case, I am very sorry. \n\n(edit:
