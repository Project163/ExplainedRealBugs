found two ways to fix this issue: \n- the assumption to generate the \"type\" property as an xml attribute is removed. This is the easiest code modification, but it changes how the Xml is serialized. Not a big deal, IMHO.\n- Change `BeanSerializerBase` to enable sub-class to modify the object id serialization processing flow. Basically, this require either removing the \"final\" modifier on `_serializeWithObjectId` or extracting the bottom part of that method (starting at `String typeStr = (_typeId == null) ? null :_customTypeId(bean);`) into a new method, which isn't final. This is still relatively simple to do, but it changes a little bit the API so dataformat-xml 2.3.1 would require databind 2.3.1 and not 2.3.0 anymore, so I don't know if this is possible for a patch version.\n\nCurrently, I've built locally a SNAPSHOT version of databind and dataformat xml with the second solution and using that in the project, and it works pretty well.\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-dataformat-xml/issues/comments/29903825/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"pgelinas","id":261076,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MTA3Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/261076?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pgelinas","html_url":"https://github.com/pgelinas","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pgelinas/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pgelinas/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pgelinas/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pgelinas/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pgelinas/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pgelinas/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pgelinas/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pgelinas/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pgelinas/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":89096708,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDg5MDk2NzA4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-dataformat-xml/issues/events/89096708","actor":{"login":"pgelinas","id":261076,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MTA3Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/261076?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pgelinas","html_url":"https://github.com/pgelinas","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pgelinas/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pgelinas/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pgelinas/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pgelinas/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pgelinas/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pgelinas/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pgelinas/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pgelinas/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pgelinas/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"06cc19bc7bf762836d625c75e63ec336723a2d0b","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pgelinas/jackson-databind/commits/06cc19bc7bf762836d625c75e63ec336723a2d0b","created_at":"2014-01-28T15:08:05Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"actor":{"login":"pgelinas","id":261076,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MTA3Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/261076?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pgelinas","html_url":"https://github.com/pgelinas","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pgelinas/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pgelinas/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pgelinas/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pgelinas/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pgelinas/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pgelinas/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pgelinas/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pgelinas/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pgelinas/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2014-01-28T15:17:26Z","updated_at":"2014-01-28T15:17:26Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/394","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/394/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/394/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/394/events","html_url":"https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind/pull/394","id":26448139,"node_id":"MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0MTE5NDk3MzU=","number":394,"title":"Support
