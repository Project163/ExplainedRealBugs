temporary.experimental.jacksonbug.Root[\"friends\"]->java.lang.Object[][2])\r\n\r\nBut when I'm trying to do so with almost same xml, except the tag 'friends' is self-closing, everything works fine\r\n```xml\r\n<root xmlns:xsi=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\">\r\n\t<friends xsi:nil=\"true\"/>\r\n</root>\r\n```\r\n\r\nI've searched for mapper configuration to avoid this problem and also browsed for xml spec, but seems nothing wrong in both xmls, so I assumed that I've faced mapper issue.\r\n\r\nThanks a lot!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-dataformat-xml/issues/293/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-dataformat-xml/issues/293/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"actor":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder","html_url":"https://github.com/cowtowncoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-08-12T23:35:13Z","updated_at":"2019-08-12T23:35:13Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-dataformat-xml/issues/352","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-dataformat-xml","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-dataformat-xml/issues/352/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-dataformat-xml/issues/352/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-dataformat-xml/issues/352/events","html_url":"https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-dataformat-xml/issues/352","id":474130664,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU0NzQxMzA2NjQ=","number":352,"title":"Please

Jackson Dataformat XML 2.14.2**\r\n\r\nWe are trying to serialize and deserialize arrays or collections of Strings containing both empty and `null` values.\r\nWe noticed that `null`s are handled correctly when serializing:\r\n* null values are rendered as `<item />`, while empty strings as `<item></item>`\r\n* enabling `ToXmlGenerator.Feature.WRITE_NULLS_AS_XSI_NIL` works as expected\r\n\r\nWhen parsing this values back `null` elements have become empty (`\"\"`) values.\r\nWe tried:\r\n* explicitly enabling `FromXmlParser.Feature.PROCESS_XSI_NIL`, even though it should be enabled by default\r\n* enabling `FromXmlParser.Feature.EMPTY_ELEMENT_AS_NULL`\r\nBut we still got empty String values as a result.\r\n\r\nTesting showed that with simple String attributes inside a class both null and empty values are correctly handled during deserialization, as expected (see also https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-dataformat-xml/issues/354).\r\n\r\nThe behavior of String values inside collections should be aligned to how String attributes inside objects are handled.\r\n\r\nHere's an example:\r\n```java\r\nXmlMapper xmlMapper = new XmlMapper();\r\nxmlMapper.enable( ToXmlGenerator.Feature.WRITE_NULLS_AS_XSI_NIL );\r\nxmlMapper.enable( FromXmlParser.Feature.PROCESS_XSI_NIL );\r\n\r\nString string = xmlMapper.writeValueAsString( new String[] { \"\", \"test\", null, \"test2\" } );\r\n// string: <Strings><item></item><item>test</item><item xmlns:xsi=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\" xsi:nil=\"true\"/><item>test2</item></Strings>\r\nString[] parsed =  xmlMapper.readValue( string, String[].class );\r\n// parsed: [\"\", \"test\", \"\", \"test2\"]\r\n```","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-dataformat-xml/issues/584/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-dataformat-xml/issues/584/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
