Will also need to add a plethora of constructor to XmlBeanSerializer and BeanSerializer to enable fluent factories.\n- the long clean road: XmlBeanSerializer shouldn't extends BeanSerializer. We should instead have a XmlBeanSerializerBase which extends BeanSerializerBase, and then have both XmlBeanSerializer and UnwrappingXmlBeanSerializer extends that base. This however re-orders the class hierarchy and XmlBeanSerializer would no longer be a sub-class of BeanSerializer, so that might cause problem.\n\nI think the second solution is the way to go. I might try that soon since I might need unwrapping support in Xml.\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-dataformat-xml/issues/comments/30268856/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"pgelinas","id":261076,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MTA3Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/261076?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pgelinas","html_url":"https://github.com/pgelinas","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pgelinas/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pgelinas/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pgelinas/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pgelinas/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pgelinas/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pgelinas/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pgelinas/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pgelinas/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pgelinas/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-dataformat-xml/issues/comments/31210577","html_url":"https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-dataformat-xml/issues/83#issuecomment-31210577","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-dataformat-xml/issues/83","id":31210577,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMxMjEwNTc3","user":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder","html_url":"https://github.com/cowtowncoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2013-12-26T04:00:15Z","updated_at":"2013-12-26T04:00:15Z","body":"Unwrapping is challenging thing to support, but if it can be made to work, great.\n\nI thin @pgelinas is probably right; and the reason for existing inheritance hierarchy is due to `BeanSerializerBase` being introduced via refactoring after XML module was created, and its use not having been retrofitted.
