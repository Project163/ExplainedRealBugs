So I did not change behavior of actual empty Lists, as far as I can see.\nThat would be a flaw.\n\nI am open to discussion for this case, but there is one potential problem with including empty List for null: handling of wrapped vs unwrapped Lists would differ (I think) if null Lists were serialized as empty ones.\n\nAlthough I guess this actually ties to another issue; that of how to express XML null (\"nil\").
