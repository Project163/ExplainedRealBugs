at the problem a bit. So, the underlying trigger is that in passing case `type` id comes first, and thereby polymorphic deserialization finds it and does not have to buffer anything. In second case there is another attribute (`id`) first, requiring buffering of at least that data. This triggers the problem: for some reason logical elements for `param` are seen as empty.\r\n\r\nAn immediate concern is that `TokenBuffer` is format-agnostic and may not be able to retain information from XML. This may or may not be relevant directly. Similarly combining of `TokenBuffer` with streaming source (`JsonParserSequence`) has same challenges.\r\nThe particular concern is that implementation of `isExpectedStartArrayToken()` does not (can not) trigger override handling same way as XML-backed `FromXmlParser`.\r\n\r\nI'll dig a little more to see what exactly causes discrepancy, and perhaps it can be resolved.\r\n\r\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-dataformat-xml/issues/comments/528581148/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder","html_url":"https://github.com/cowtowncoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-dataformat-xml/issues/comments/528619989","html_url":"https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-dataformat-xml/issues/242#issuecomment-528619989","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-dataformat-xml/issues/242","id":528619989,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUyODYxOTk4OQ==","user":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder","html_url":"https://github.com/cowtowncoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-09-05T22:43:20Z","updated_at":"2019-09-05T22:43:20Z","body":"Some more info: `isExpectedStartArrayToken()` itself not problematic, but check by `WrapperHandlingDeserializer` is: due to buffering, parser is `JsonParserDelegate`, not `FromXmlParser`, so `_configureParser()` can not add virtual wrapping.
