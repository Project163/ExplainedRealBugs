I understand there may be a more robust fix on the table as alluded to here (https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-dataformat-xml/pull/604#issuecomment-1770080319), but in the meantime removing this `throw` doesn't appear to break anything, and restores functionality that was lost with the 2.13 release.\r\n\r\nWould you be willing to consider a stopgap PR in which this was addressed in such a manner? If so I'd be happy to put one together.","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-dataformat-xml/issues/comments/2104698113/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"wickstopher","id":1975810,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NzU4MTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1975810?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wickstopher","html_url":"https://github.com/wickstopher","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wickstopher/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wickstopher/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wickstopher/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wickstopher/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wickstopher/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wickstopher/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wickstopher/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wickstopher/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wickstopher/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":12770425852,"node_id":"MEE_lADOABJ3ss5BTxJwzwAAAAL5LTv8","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-dataformat-xml/issues/events/12770425852","actor":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder","html_url":"https://github.com/cowtowncoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2024-05-10T14:21:11Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":12770425868,"node_id":"SE_lADOABJ3ss5BTxJwzwAAAAL5LTwM","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-dataformat-xml/issues/events/12770425868","actor":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder","html_url":"https://github.com/cowtowncoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2024-05-10T14:21:11Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-dataformat-xml/issues/comments/2104779575","html_url":"https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-dataformat-xml/issues/509#issuecomment-2104779575","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-dataformat-xml/issues/509","id":2104779575,"node_id":"IC_kwDOABJ3ss59dGM3","user":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder","html_url":"https://github.com/cowtowncoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url"
