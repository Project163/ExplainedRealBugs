This is unfortunate as it brings in JAXB api dependency which has become a regular cluster-fudge with Javax/Jakarta fiasco.\r\nEven if we solve the problem wrt JAXB (JAKB?) introspector, this likely just doubles the problem as there are now 2 alternative possibilities.\r\n\r\nSo let's figure out a way to remove this particular problem by adding a small shim (\"XML annotation add-ons\" or something) in databind, and let JAXB annotations module  and XML format module interact via that mini API, avoiding direct dependency in either direction.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder","html_url":"https://github.com/cowtowncoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-dataformat-xml/issues/462/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-dataformat-xml/issues/462/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
