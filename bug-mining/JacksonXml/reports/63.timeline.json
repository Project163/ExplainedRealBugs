That ticket explains rationale.\r\n\r\nIf this is due to #374, it would not be considered a bug, but fix to inconsistent/wrong behavior. It is unfortunate if there is existing code that counted on that behavior, however.\r\nI am not sure what would be the best way forward here.\r\n\r\n\r\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-dataformat-xml/issues/comments/907426109/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder","html_url":"https://github.com/cowtowncoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":5220309295,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50NTIyMDMwOTI5NQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-dataformat-xml/issues/events/5220309295","actor":{"login":"marcospassos","id":943036,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk0MzAzNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/943036?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcospassos","html_url":"https://github.com/marcospassos","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcospassos/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcospassos/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcospassos/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcospassos/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcospassos/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcospassos/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcospassos/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcospassos/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcospassos/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-08-27T19:24:48Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":5220309298,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDUyMjAzMDkyOTg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-dataformat-xml/issues/events/5220309298","actor":{"login":"marcospassos","id":943036,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk0MzAzNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/943036?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcospassos","html_url":"https://github.com/marcospassos","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcospassos/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcospassos/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcospassos/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcospassos/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcospassos/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcospassos/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcospassos/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcospassos/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcospassos/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-08-27T19:24:48Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":5220309304,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50NTIyMDMwOTMwNA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-dataformat-xml/issues/events/5220309304","actor":{"login":"ionel-sirbu-crunch","id":68114012,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4MTE0MDEy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/68114012?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ionel-sirbu-crunch","html_url":"https://github.com/ionel-sirbu-crunch","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ionel-sirbu-crunch/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ionel-sirbu-crunch/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ionel-sirbu-crunch/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ionel-sirbu-crunch/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ionel-sirbu-crunch/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ionel-sirbu-crunch/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ionel-sirbu-crunch/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ionel-sirbu-crunch/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ionel-sirbu-crunch/rec
