To error out by default when any key or `@JsonProperty` is provided that can not fit inside a XML tag. As I mentioned, this should ideally happen regardless, since it is always a good idea to fail early.\r\n2. To provide a flag `ToXmlGenerator.Feature` (or something, you probably know better here) to escape *all* invalid XML tag names with attribute strings:\r\n  \r\n   ``` xml\r\n   <!-- Without escaping\r\n   <00 foo <N/A> $$$ bar=\"Hello World!\">oh no</00 foo <N/A> $$$ bar=\"Hello World!\">\r\n   -->\r\n   <!-- With escaping -->\r\n   <complexTag name=\"00 foo <N/A> $$$ bar=&quot;Hello World!&quot;\">works</complexTag>\r\n   <complexTag name=\"complexTag\">Not ideal but what can you do...</complexTag>\r\n   ```\r\n3. Optionally, provide an additional flag to *always* generate maps this way for consistancy.\r\n\r\nThis way, the resulting XML is still always easily readable, the serialization / deserialization process is 100% reversible, and `jackson-dataformat-xml` is 100% backwards compatible by default. However, I don't know how much work this would be to implement since I am not familiar with the code base.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nIf all this is not an option, than maybe instead of name mangling this could be done?\r\n\r\n- Always escape leading `_` as `__`\r\n- If there would be invalid chars in the tag, encode the tag as base32 (or hex, base64 also has probelematic chars) and emit `_GAYCAZTPN4QDYTRPIE7CAJBEEQQGEYLSHUREQZLMNRXSAV3POJWGIIJC` (trailing `=` replaced with `_`)","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-dataformat-xml/issues/comments/1119344286/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"mensinda","id":3407462,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MDc0NjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3407462?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mensinda","html_url":"https://github.com/mensinda","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mensinda/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mensinda/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mensinda/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mensinda/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mensinda/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mensinda/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mensinda/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mensinda/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mensinda/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-dataformat-xml/issues/comments/1119948533","html_url":"https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-dataformat-xml/issues/523#issuecomment-1119948533","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-dataformat-xml/issues/523","id":1119948533,"node_id":"IC_kwDOABJ3ss5CwQ71","user":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder","html_url":"https://github.com/cowtowncoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-05-06T19:29:29Z","updated_at":"2022-05-06T19:29:29Z","body":"Correct: there is no way to make name-mangling reversible. For POJOs this is non-optimal but doable.\r\nBut not so with `Map`s. So the solution would need to be different for `Map`s -- probably changing serialization structure.\r\n\r\nBut while both use logical structure of (JSON) Object for serialization, their handling is very different within `jackson-databind`; and making it possible to (some degree) use different handling.\r\n\r\nAnd this is where the challenge wrt `Map`s comes from: Map serialization/deserialization is handled by `jackson-databind`, in format-agnostic way -- it simply processes streaming level tokens/events, as if all content had logical structure of JSON.\r\nIt is of course possible to override many things by format module adding handlers, including custom (de)serializers (via XmlModule). But that in itself adds complexity.\r\n\r\nIt might be possible to define new `JsonFormat.Shape` option for `Map` handling: `JsonFormat.Shape.ARRAY`. This could perhaps be used to solve the issue, but I think that might already run into trouble wrt XML's not having native Array type (meaning that streaming token handling might become
