issue was originally pointed out by https://github.com/ShijunK in https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-dataformat-xml/issues/64 \n\nI also came across this issue while working with a very complex XML and thought it would be worthwhile raising this on its own. I've re-used ShijunK's example:\n\n```\npublic class UnwrappedTest {\n    @JacksonXmlRootElement(localName = \"root\")    \n    static class Root {\n\n        @JacksonXmlProperty(localName = \"unwrapped\")\n        @JacksonXmlElementWrapper(useWrapping = false)\n        public List<UnwrappedElement> unwrapped;\n\n        @JacksonXmlProperty(localName = \"name\")\n        public String name;\n\n        public static class UnwrappedElement {\n            public UnwrappedElement () {}\n\n            public UnwrappedElement (String id, String type) {\n                this.id = id;\n                this.type = type;\n            }\n\n            @JacksonXmlProperty(isAttribute = true)\n            public String id;\n\n            @JacksonXmlProperty(isAttribute = true)\n            public String type;\n        }\n    }\n\n    protected final static XmlMapper xmlMapper = new XmlMapper();\n    protected final String rootXml = \"<root>\"  + System.lineSeparator() +\n            \"  <unwrapped id=\\\"1\\\" type=\\\"string\\\"/>\"  + System.lineSeparator() +\n            \"  <unwrapped id=\\\"2\\\" type=\\\"string\\\"/>\"  + System.lineSeparator() +\n            \"  <name>text</name>\"  + System.lineSeparator() +\n            \"</root>\";\n\n    protected final Root rootObject = new Root();\n\n    @Before\n    public void setUp() {\n        xmlMapper.enable(SerializationFeature.INDENT_OUTPUT);\n        rootObject.unwrapped = Arrays.asList(\n                new Root.UnwrappedElement(\"1\", \"string\"),\n                new Root.UnwrappedElement(\"2\", \"string\")\n        );\n        rootObject.name = \"text\";\n    }\n\n    @Test\n    public void serializeTest () throws Exception {\n        //SUCCESS\n        assertThat(xmlMapper.writeValueAsString(rootObject)).isEqualTo(rootXml);\n    }\n\n    @Test\n    public void derializeTest () throws Exception {\n        //FAILS with invalid index error\n        assertThat(xmlMapper.readValue(rootXml, Root.class)).isEqualsToByComparingFields(rootObject);\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThe exception is:\n\n```\njava.lang.IllegalArgumentException: Invalid index 0; current element has only 0 attributes\nat com.ctc.wstx.sr.AttributeCollector.throwIndex(AttributeCollector.java:1037)\nat com.ctc.wstx.sr.AttributeCollector.getLocalName(AttributeCollector.java:330)\nat com.ctc.wstx.sr.BasicStreamReader.getAttributeLocalName(BasicStreamReader.java:583)\nat com.fasterxml.jackson.dataformat.xml.deser.XmlTokenStream._next(XmlTokenStream.java:306)\nat com.fasterxml.jackson.dataformat.xml.deser.XmlTokenStream.next(XmlTokenStream.java:162)\nat com.fasterxml.jackson.dataformat.xml.deser.FromXmlParser.nextToken(FromXmlParser.java:451)\nat com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.deser.BeanDeserializer.vanillaDeserialize(BeanDeserializer.java:238)\nat com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.deser.BeanDeserializer.deserialize(BeanDeserializer.java:118)\nat com.fasterxml.jackson.dataformat.xml.deser.WrapperHandlingDeserializer.deserialize(WrapperHandlingDeserializer.java:109)\nat com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.ObjectMapper._readMapAndClose(ObjectMapper.java:2993)\nat com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.ObjectMapper.readValue(ObjectMapper.java:2098)\nat com.mgl.caf.loaniq.api.models.UnwrappedTest.testUnwrappedWithOptionalAttribute(UnwrappedTest.java:44)\n```\n\nI'm using Jackson 2.3.1 with Woodstox 4.2.0. I will attempt to work around this issue by using JAXB in the meanwhile. \n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-dataformat-xml/issues/101/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-dataformat-xml/issues/101/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
