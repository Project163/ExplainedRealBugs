or Jackson expert, so I definitely may have done mistakes or misconfigured my mapper or POJOs, in that case, any hint is appreciated.\r\nTo my surprise, `<wrapper><pojos></pojos></wrapper>` returns a `null` `Pojos` object, while `<wrapper></wrapper>` returns an instance of `Pojos` (as you can see in `testWrapperWithoutPojos` test).\r\nI think this is a bug.\r\n\r\nDependencies to ensure we test in the same conditions:\r\norg.projectlombok:lombok:jar:1.16.14\r\norg.mockito:mockito-core:jar:2.7.9\r\ncom.fasterxml.jackson.dataformat:jackson-dataformat-xml:jar:2.9.0.pr4\r\ncom.fasterxml.jackson.core:jackson-core:jar:2.9.0.pr4\r\ncom.fasterxml.jackson.core:jackson-annotations:jar:2.9.0.pr4\r\ncom.fasterxml.jackson.module:jackson-module-jaxb-annotations:jar:2.9.0.pr4\r\n\r\nNote I also tried with jackson 2.8.9 version (for all Jackson-related libraries obviously) without this line:\r\n```java\r\nmapper.setDefaultSetterInfo(JsonSetter.Value.forContentNulls(Nulls.SKIP));\r\n```\r\nand the problem
