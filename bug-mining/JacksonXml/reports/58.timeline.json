Please describe.**\r\nA clear and concise description of what the problem is. Ex. I'm always frustrated when [...]\r\n\r\nIn an application where the current Threads context class loader is not the main class loader I am unable to load the required stax implementation required by jackson-xml-databind. The one bundled in the JDK is incompatible.\r\n\r\nIn normal situations I would pass by expected classloader down to whatever is doing the classloading, unfortunately jackson-databind-xml doesn't expose a method for that although the [JDK does](https://github.com/AdoptOpenJDK/openjdk-jdk8u/blob/64cc2bc73816f3e0a91776805482fee37fa37bbe/jaxp/src/javax/xml/stream/XMLInputFactory.java#L287),

does provide constructors for an already configured `XmlFactory`, if I could pass that to the `JacksonAdapter` in some way then that would solve my problem, (would be passed to the `builder` instead of it creating one) https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-java/blob/main/sdk/core/azure-core/src/main/java/com/azure/core/util/serializer/JacksonAdapter.java#L137\r\n\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nA supported API for providing either my classloader for loading the `XMLInputFactory` or providing a precreated `XmlFactory`\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\n\r\n* There's work in progress to try hack this by setting the thread context classloader, but it's brittle work and leads to very ugly code, https://github.com/jenkinsci/azure-storage-plugin/pull/195\r\n\r\n* Allowing me to pass a custom classloader would be better all round, I've raised a PR to jackson to see if they'll take that PR:

revert of #5559, which removed `stax-api-1.0.1.jar`, `stax-api-1.0-2.jar`, and `wstx-asl-3.2.9.jar` from the WAR under the premise that StAX was now provided by the Java Platform. While removing the first two JARs caused no problems, removing `wstx-asl-3.2.9.jar` (a StAX implementation, in particular the very old Woodstox 3.2.9) was apparently too aggressive and did cause jenkinsci/azure-storage-plugin#194. As a hotfix, restore the working status quo by re-adding `wstx-asl-3.2.9.jar` to the WAR. I verified that this chases away jenkinsci/azure-storage-plugin#194. In the future, it would be good to rationalize our usage of StAX/Jackson/Woodstox across core and the Jackson 2 API plugin and eliminate this old dependency from core. In particular, we shouldn't need to ship Woodstox in core at all, but rather the Jackson 2 API plugin should provide a modern version of `jackson-databind-xml` and Woodstox to all dependent plugins. That is a bit more work and I couldn't complete it in a few hours. In the meantime the regression in core needs to be fixed ASAP.\r\n\r\n### Proposed changelog entries\r\n\r\nFix a regression in 2.298 where some plugins (including Azure Storage) could not correctly parse streaming XML output.\r\n\r\n### Proposed upgrade guidelines\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n### Submitter checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] (If applicable) Jira issue is well described\r\n- [x] Changelog entries and upgrade guidelines are appropriate for the audience affected by the change (users or developer, depending on the change).
