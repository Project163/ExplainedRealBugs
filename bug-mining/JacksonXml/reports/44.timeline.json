So, this is now implemented, without changing defaults but making it possible to change default to change serialization.\r\n\r\nThere are couple of potential concerns that may need future work:\r\n\r\n* Custom `Base64Variant`s may be passed but can not really be translated, so it further customizations needed, it may be necessary to add XML-specific overrides so users may pass native Stax2 `ByteVariant` to use (instead of Jackson's variants that can only map to pre-defined set)\r\n* Reader side does not use Stax2 typed reads (for a few reasons) and hence actually directly uses Jackson's `BaseVariant` for decoding. If native Stax2 codecs were to be used on writing, reader-side would need some more thought.\r\n* I added tests but noticed that special character encoding of \"MODIFIED-FOR-URL\" is not checked (I don't expect there to be significant issues there, just observation)\r\n\r\nStill, I think this is useful improvement over earlier versions: functionality will be included in 2.12(.0).\r\n\r\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-dataformat-xml/issues/comments/628328811/reactions","total_count":4,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":2,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder","html_url":"https://github.com/cowtowncoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":3729155193,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDM3MjkxNTUxOTM=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-dataformat-xml/issues/events/3729155193","actor":{"login":"alex-bel-apica","id":59914523,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5OTE0NTIz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/59914523?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alex-bel-apica","html_url":"https://github.com/alex-bel-apica","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alex-bel-apica/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alex-bel-apica/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alex-bel-apica/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alex-bel-apica/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alex-bel-apica/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alex-bel-apica/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alex-bel-apica/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alex-bel-apica/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alex-bel-apica/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"656d2b4f3738f7e789432d4baf25f7fd0d62c974","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ApicaSystem/jackson-dataformat-xml/commits/656d2b4f3738f7e789432d4baf25f7fd0d62c974","created_at":"2020-09-04T10:45:25Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
