XML specification does not specify semantics for `xsi:nil` (with appropriate namespace), XML Schema specification does, and so some Java XML libraries (including JAXB) support mapping it into `null`s.\r\n(there is the related question of generation/writing, but this issue covers only read side).\r\n\r\nIt would be good if Jackson did same mapping automatically.\r\n\r\nFor background, see\r\n\r\n* #89 (nil like JAXB)\r\n* #184 (for `BigDecimal` etc values)\r\n* #293 (nil for Collections)\r\n* #353 (nil in
