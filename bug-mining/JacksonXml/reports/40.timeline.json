I have just discovered that for some weird/unknown reason, that\r\n\r\n* \"price\" field (String) must be the first field in the \"class Price\", and even weirder, \r\n* the xml you're trying to deserialise  `<price>123</price>` must be the first tag. \r\n\r\nIn that example, I just had to change:\r\n\r\n`<price><num>123</num><price>123</price></price>` to\r\n`<price><price>123</price><num>123</num></price>`.\r\n\r\nNotice that `<price>` must precede `<num>`. This must also be true in the class Price as well.\r\n\r\nThis is the full example:\r\n\r\n```\r\n    @JacksonXmlRootElement(localName = \"price\")\r\n\t@JsonIgnoreProperties(ignoreUnknown =
