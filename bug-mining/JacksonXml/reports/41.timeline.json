I did observe that replace start and end tags of `Element` with empty `<Element ... />` tag did, for some reason, actually remove the exception (although did not make things work fully as expected).\r\nThis is weird, but maybe would help figure out the underlying problem.\r\n\r\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-dataformat-xml/issues/comments/357084622/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder","html_url":"https://github.com/cowtowncoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"actor":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder","html_url":"https://github.com/cowtowncoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-01-26T06:22:41Z","updated_at":"2018-01-26T06:22:41Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-dataformat-xml/issues/274","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-dataformat-xml","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-dataformat-xml/issues/274/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-dataformat-xml/issues/274/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-dataformat-xml/issues/274/events","html_url":"https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-dataformat-xml/issues/274","id":279563979,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWUyNzk1NjM5Nzk=","number":274,"title":"No

[jackson-databind-2.8.7-2.8.8](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind/compare/jackson-databind-2.8.7...jackson-databind-2.8.8) since there are no notable changes in

From version 2.8.8+ this throws an exception. I can fix this on our end with any of the mentioned fixes just thought I would mention it.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-dataformat-xml/issues/274/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-dataformat-xml/issues/274/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"actor":{"login":"dependabot-preview[bot]","id":27856297,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90Mjc4NTYyOTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/2141?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dependabot-preview%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/dependabot-preview","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dependabot-preview%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dependabot-preview%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dependabot-preview%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dependabot-preview%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dependabot-preview%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dependabot-preview%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dependabot-preview%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dependabot-preview%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dependabot-preview%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-03-21T17:55:22Z","updated_at":"2018-03-21T17:55:22Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/stachu540/HiRezAPI/issues/32","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/stachu540/HiRezAPI","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/stachu540/HiRezAPI/issues/32/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/stachu540/HiRezAPI/issues/32/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/stachu540/HiRezAPI/issues/32/events","html_url":"https://github.com/stachu540/HiRezAPI/pull/32","id":307355402,"node_id":"MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0MTc2NTYxNDk1","number":32,"title":"Bump

I think I know where to look now: chances are this has to do with unwrapped Lists; probably start/end tag matching is not doing case-insensitivity as it should.\r\n\r\nBut the tricky part is, maybe surprisingly, that low-level XML parser (streaming API impl) has no concept of case-insensitivity, yet, all handled (currently) at databind layer.\r\nBut will see if knowledge is necessary or if it'd be possible to just rely on matching of start/end elements
