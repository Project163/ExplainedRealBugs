for 2.12(.0). Couple of limitations:\r\n\r\n1. While ordering of text segments will be retained (wrt each other), since all will be under logical key of \"\"  (empty String), total ordering for all segments is not retained\r\n2. Blank (all-whitespace) text segments are not retained (not even between end-start-element) -- currently they must be skipped to make indentation work for regular content.\r\n\r\nSo it may make sense to introduce something more specific for really accurate XML content (besides above-mentioned issues, element/attribute distinction is not preserved either).\r\nChoices include:\r\n\r\n* Make DOM `Element` bind directly from underlying XML elements (instead of trying to parse textual values\r\n* Create something similar to DOM (JDOM, DOM4j); `XmlNode` for example, make that bind.\r\n\r\nBut work for those need to go under different
