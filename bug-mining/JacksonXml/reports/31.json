Thereby saving some memory by not having to load the entire stream's content into memory all at once.\r\n\r\nHowever, `ToXmlGenerator` does not implement this method. It only implements a writeBinary overload that takes an already existing `byte[]`.\r\n\r\nI first [reported this issue](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/jackson-user/rZ8UwvXtArM) on the jackson-user google group, and @cowtowncoder suggested I open an issue on GitHub.","closed_by":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder","html_url":"https://github.com/cowtowncoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-dataformat-xml/issues/270/reactions","total_count":12,"+1":12,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-dataformat-xml/issues/270/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
