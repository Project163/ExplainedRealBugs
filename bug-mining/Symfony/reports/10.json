Since upgrading to 6.4.5 the behavior of the cache:clear command changed. We now get a \"Warning: is_readable(): open_basedir restriction in effect. File(/proc/mounts) is not within the allowed path(s): ...\" warning. It gets triggered by the isNfs(string $dir) method in Symfony\\Bundle\\FrameworkBundle\\Command\\CacheClearCommand.\r\n\r\nI was able to narrow it down to this commit:\r\n[FrameworkBundle] Prevent silenced warning by checking if /proc/mount…  (https://github.com/symfony/symfony/commit/349b3e70d38d7da2ac499eb594a54877adc1700e)\n\n### How to reproduce\n\nTo reproduce run symfony in an php environment with config\r\nopen_basedir = /var/www/\r\nor likely and run the cache:clear command.\n\n### Possible Solution\n\nSince is_readable() produces meaningful output even when restricted by open_basedir config, changing the if statement from\r\n\r\nif ('/' === \\DIRECTORY_SEPARATOR && is_readable('/proc/mounts') && $files = @file('/proc/mounts')) \r\nto\r\nif ('/' === \\DIRECTORY_SEPARATOR && @is_readable('/proc/mounts') && $files = @file('/proc/mounts')) \r\n\r\nwould suppress the error without having any negative side effects.\n\n### Additional Context\n\n_No response_","closed_by":{"login":"xabbuh","id":1957048,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NTcwNDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1957048?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xabbuh","html_url":"https://github.com/xabbuh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xabbuh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xabbuh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xabbuh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xabbuh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xabbuh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xabbuh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xabbuh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xabbuh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xabbuh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/symfony/symfony/issues/54402/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/symfony/symfony/issues/54402/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
