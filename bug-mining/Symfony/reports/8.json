Because we have multiple 'environments' (pages for clubs, for individual members and for admins) served on sub domains, we have currently extended the Route annotation with a ClubRoute, PersonRoute and AdminRoute, containing the default hostname, a prefix for the routes and some defaults and requirements for the parameters in this route.\r\n\r\nSince the Route attribute is final, extending of the attribute is not possible. Therefore we have to repeat this configuration in a lot of controllers. I understand the choice to make the Route final, but hope for a way to allow us using the preset routes. An alternative for removing the final status would be an option to register custom Route attributes for the routing system, but I haven't found a good extension point to do this.\n\n### Example\n\n_No response_","closed_by":{"login":"xabbuh","id":1957048,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NTcwNDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1957048?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xabbuh","html_url":"https://github.com/xabbuh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xabbuh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xabbuh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xabbuh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xabbuh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xabbuh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xabbuh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xabbuh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xabbuh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xabbuh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/symfony/symfony/issues/53467/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/symfony/symfony/issues/53467/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
