That's precisely why we have the service resetter which is about resetting stateful services for a long-running process.\r\nResetting the container in such place will not work either, as the worker

Q             | A\r\n| ------------- | ---\r\n| Branch?       | 7.1\r\n| Bug fix?      | yes\r\n| New feature?  | no\r\n| Deprecations? | no\r\n| Issues        | Fix #59128\r\n| License       | MIT\r\n\r\n\r\nAs mentioned in #59128 and https://github.com/symfony/symfony/pull/54666#issuecomment-2479860954 (and proceeding comments), EnvVarProcessor isn't tagged with kernel.reset, hence its reset method is never called in ServicesResetter.\r\n\r\nAnother issue was that env vars are cached high up in stack (in Container class) and even if EnvVarProcessor's cached env vars are cleared, env var loaders still won't be called as env var loaders are called only for missing env keys.\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes #59128 by adding the missing tag and also clears \"env cache\" of Container in `EnvVarProcessor::reset()` method (i.e. whenever env vars of EnvVarProcessor are cleared). This is a safe change and won't break existing apps using symfony messenger.\r\n\r\ncc
