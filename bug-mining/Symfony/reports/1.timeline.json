Symfony version(s) affected\n\n6.3\n\n### Description\n\nUserBadge accepts an optional `callable $userLoader` as second argument\r\n\r\nThe phpdoc states the following:\r\n\r\n> Optionally, you may pass a user loader. This callable receives the $userIdentifier as argument and must return a UserInterface object (otherwise an AuthenticationServiceException is thrown). If this is not set, the default user provider will be used with $userIdentifier as username.\r\n\r\nDue to the following change, the default user provider is always used, even when explicitly set as described above:\r\nhttps://github.com/symfony/symfony/pull/48272/files#diff-de9707bb338188f62878f2ebd42e7a7bf9547f6d0bf07a4fcd9c386c263c601b\n\n### How to reproduce\n\nsrc/Security/AccessTokenHandler.php\r\n```php\r\n<?php\r\n\r\nuse Symfony\\Component\\Security\\Core\\User\\InMemoryUser;\r\nuse Symfony\\Component\\Security\\Http\\AccessToken\\AccessTokenHandlerInterface;\r\nuse Symfony\\Component\\Security\\Http\\Authenticator\\Passport\\Badge\\UserBadge;\r\n\r\nclass AccessTokenHandler implements AccessTokenHandlerInterface\r\n{\r\n    public function getUserBadgeFrom(#[\\SensitiveParameter] string $accessToken): UserBadge\r\n    {\r\n        return new UserBadge('test', function (string $id) {\r\n            return new InMemoryUser($id, null, ['ROLE_USER']);\r\n        });\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nconfig/packages/security.yaml\r\n```yaml\r\n#...\r\n    firewalls:\r\n        main:\r\n#...\r\n            access_token:\r\n                token_handler: App\\Security\\AccessTokenHandler\r\n```\n\n### Possible Solution\n\nRevert removal of `null === $userBadge->getUserLoader() &&`\n\n### Additional Context\n\nThere is also a similar check to prevent overriding the custom user loader in UserProviderListener:\r\nhttps://github.com/symfony/symfony/blob/6.3/src/Symfony/Component/Security/Http/EventListener/UserProviderListener.php#L44","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/symfony/symfony/issues/51103/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/symfony/symfony/issues/51103/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"not_planned"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"actor":{"login":"guillaumesmo","id":1309544,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMDk1NDQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1309544?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/guillaumesmo","html_url":"https://github.com/guillaumesmo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guillaumesmo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guillaumesmo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guillaumesmo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guillaumesmo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guillaumesmo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guillaumesmo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guillaumesmo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guillaumesmo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guillaumesmo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2023-07-25T20:07:31Z","updated_at":"2023-07-25T20:07:31Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/symfony/symfony/issues/51104","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/symfony/symfony","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/symfony/symfony/issues/51104/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/symfony/symfony/issues/51104/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/symfony/symfony/issues/51104/events","html_url":"https://github.com/symfony/symfony/pull/51104","id":1821056811,"node_id":"PR_kwDOAAb9Ss5WXzhe","number":51104,"title":"[Security]
