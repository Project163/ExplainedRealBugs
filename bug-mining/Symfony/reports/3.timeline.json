Symfony version(s) affected\r\n\r\n6.x, 5.x\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nEverytime a message is retried, the DoctrineSender adds another `TransportMessageIdStamp` with the new id to the envelope. This id (the latest id) is needed for the `bin/console messenger:failed:show` command.\r\n\r\nIf a message is retried many times, the new id is appended as a new stamp and the stamps get more and more, which leads to a bigger and bigger serialized envelope in the database. Ultimately this can lead to very big binlogs in MySQL.\r\n\r\nThis is especially noticeable, when you need to check a condition every second and therefore use the Messenger component. If that condition is not yet met, the message is retried by throwing a `RecoverableMessageHandlingException` inside a transport with a retry multiplier of 1 (see \"How to reproduce\").\r\n\r\n### How to reproduce\r\n\r\nExample uses Symfony 6.2:\r\n\r\n```YAML\r\n# config/packages/messenger.yaml\r\n\r\nframework:\r\n    messenger:\r\n        transports:\r\n            check:\r\n                dsn: 'doctrine://default?queue_name=check'\r\n                retry_strategy:\r\n                    delay: 1000\r\n                    multiplier: 1\r\n```\r\n\r\n```php\r\n# src/Message/CheckMessage.php\r\n\r\nnamespace App\\Message;\r\n\r\nclass CheckMessage\r\n{\r\n    public function __construct()\r\n    {\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n```php\r\n# src/Handler/CheckHandler.php\r\n\r\nnamespace App\\Handler;\r\n\r\nuse App\\Message\\CheckMessage;\r\nuse Symfony\\Component\\Messenger\\Attribute\\AsMessageHandler;\r\nuse Symfony\\Component\\Messenger\\Exception\\RecoverableMessageHandlingException;\r\n\r\n#[AsMessageHandler]\r\nclass CheckHandler\r\n{\r\n    public function __invoke(CheckMessage $message): never\r\n    {\r\n        throw new RecoverableMessageHandlingException();\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n```php\r\n# src/Command/QueueCommand.php\r\n\r\nnamespace App\\Command;\r\n\r\nuse App\\Message\\CheckMessage;\r\nuse Symfony\\Component\\Console\\Attribute\\AsCommand;\r\nuse Symfony\\Component\\Console\\Command\\Command;\r\nuse Symfony\\Component\\Console\\Input\\InputInterface;\r\nuse Symfony\\Component\\Console\\Output\\OutputInterface;\r\nuse Symfony\\Component\\Messenger\\MessageBusInterface;\r\n\r\n#[AsCommand(name: 'app:check:queue')]\r\nclass QueueCommand extends Command\r\n{\r\n    public function __construct(\r\n        private readonly MessageBusInterface $bus,\r\n    )\r\n    {\r\n        parent::__construct();\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    protected function execute(InputInterface $input, OutputInterface $output): int\r\n    {\r\n        $this->bus->dispatch(new CheckMessage());\r\n\r\n        return Command::SUCCESS;\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n1. Insert a message into the queue: \r\n```\r\nbin/console app:check:queue\r\n```\r\n\r\n2. Handle this message 100 times:\r\n```\r\nbin/console messenger:consume check -l 100\r\n```\r\n\r\n3. Open the `body` of the message from the `messenger_messages` table. You see 100 `TransportMessageIdStamp`s:\r\n```\r\n(...) s:57:\\\"Symfony\\\\Component\\\\Messenger\\\\Stamp\\\\TransportMessageIdStamp\\\";a:100:{i:0;O:57:\\\"Symfony\\\\Component\\\\Messenger\\\\Stamp\\\\TransportMessageIdStamp\\\":1:{s:61:\\\"\\0Symfony\\\\Component\\\\Messenger\\\\Stamp\\\\TransportMessageIdStamp\\0id\\\";i:13311314;}i:1;O:57:\\\"Symfony\\\\Component\\\\Messenger\\\\Stamp\\\\TransportMessageIdStamp\\\":1:{s:61:\\\"\\0Symfony\\\\Component\\\\Messenger\\\\Stamp\\\\TransportMessageIdStamp\\0id\\\";i:13311315;}i:2;O:57:\\\"Symfony\\\\Component\\\\Messenger\\\\Stamp\\\\TransportMessageIdStamp\\\":1:{s:61:\\\"\\0Symfony\\\\Component\\\\Messenger\\\\Stamp\\\\TransportMessageIdStamp\\0id\\\";i:13311316;}i:3;O:57:\\\"Symfony\\\\Component\\\\Messenger\\\\Stamp\\\\TransportMessageIdStamp\\\":1:{s:61:\\\"\\0Symfony\\\\Component\\\\Messenger\\\\Stamp\\\\TransportMessageIdStamp\\0id\\\";i:13311317;}i:4;O:57:\\\"Symfony\\\\Component\\\\Messenger\\\\Stamp\\\\TransportMessageIdStamp\\\":1:{s:61:\\\"\\0Symfony\\\\Component\\\\Messenger\\\\Stamp\\\\TransportMessageIdStamp\\0id\\\";i:13311318;}i:5;O:57:\\\"Symfony\\\\Component\\\\Messenger\\\\Stamp\\\\TransportMessageIdStamp\\\":1:{s:61:\\\"\\0Symfony\\\\Component\\\\Messenger\\\\Stamp\\\\TransportMessageIdStamp\\0id\\\";i:13311319;}i:6;O:57:\\\"Symfony\\\\Component\\\\Messenger\\\\Stamp\\\\TransportMessageIdStamp\\\":1:{s:61:\\\"\\0Symfony\\\\Component\\\\Messenger\\\\Stamp\\\\TransportMessageIdStamp\\0id\\\";i:13311320;}i:7;O:57:\\\"Symfony\\\\Component\\\\Messenger\\\\Stamp\\\\TransportMessageIdStamp\\\":1:{s:61:\\\"\\0Symfony\\\\Component\\\\Messenger\\\\Stamp\\\\TransportMessageIdStamp\\0id\\\";i:13311321;}i:8;O:57:\\\"Symfony\\\\Component\\\\Messenger\\\\Stamp\\\\TransportMessageIdStamp\\\":1:{s:61:\\\"\\0Symfony\\\\Component\\\\Messenger\\\\Stamp\\\\TransportMessageIdStamp\\0id\\\";i:13311322;}i:9;O:57:\\\"Symfony\\\\Component\\\\Messenger\\\\Stamp\\\\TransportMessageIdStamp\\\":1:{s:61:\\\"\\0Symfony\\\\Component\\\\Messenger\\\\Stamp\\\\TransportMessageIdStamp\\0id\\\";i:13311323;}i:10;O:57:\\\"Symfony\\\\Component\\\\Messenger\\\\Stamp\\\\TransportMessageIdStamp\\\":1:{s:61:\\\"\\0Symfony\\\\Component\\\\Messenger\\\\Stamp\\\\TransportMessageIdStamp\\0id\\\";i:13311324;}i:11;O:57:\\\"Symfony\\\\Component\\\\Messenger\\\\Stamp\\\\TransportMessageIdStamp\\\":1:{s:61:\\\"\\0Symfony\\\\Component\\\\Messenger\\\\Stamp\\\\TransportMessageIdStamp\\0id\\\";i:13311325;}(...)\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Possible Solution\r\n\r\nAs far as I can see, the id from the `TransportMessageIdStamp` is only used for the messenger:failed:show/retry/remove commands to be able to show/retry/remove specific messages.\r\n\r\nFor this command, the `DoctrineReceiver` is used and always adds its own `TransportMessageIdStamp` with the current id to the envelope. The stamp from the received message from the database is not used at all.\r\n\r\nIt should be enough to only keep the latest `TransportMessageIdStamp` and remove all previous `TransportMessageIdStamp`s inside the `DoctrineSender` and `DoctrineReceiver`.\r\n\r\n### Additional Context\r\n\r\n_No
