The rule works for foreign (mainly greek) words. This is an irregular case not a standard.\r\n\r\nWe can already see 3 other rules for words ending in -pon, -son and -con. \n\n### How to reproduce\n\n```php\r\n// First, run \"composer require symfony/string\"\r\n// Then, execute this file:\r\n<?php\r\nrequire_once __DIR__.'/vendor/autoload.php';\r\nuse Symfony\\Component\\String\\Inflector\\EnglishInflector;\r\n\r\n// returns \"butta\" instead of \"buttons\"\r\necho (new EnglishInflector())->pluralize('button');\r\n```\n\n### Possible Solution\n\nI'm not an english native-speaker nor an expert of english grammar but I think that it would be better to have a rule dedicated to the foreign word ending in -on, phenomenon and criterion (and maybe others) + a generic rule for words ending in -on.\n\n### Additional Context\n\n_No response_","closed_by":{"login":"fabpot","id":47313,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3MzEz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47313?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fabpot","html_url":"https://github.com/fabpot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fabpot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fabpot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fabpot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fabpot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fabpot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fabpot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fabpot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fabpot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fabpot/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/symfony/symfony/issues/54611/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/symfony/symfony/issues/54611/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
