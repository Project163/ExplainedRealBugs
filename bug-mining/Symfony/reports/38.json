Obviously I can workaround this by redirecting the output but this is not normal behaviour.\n\n### How to reproduce\n\n```sh\nbin/console messenger:failed:show --max 10000 | less\n```\n\nObserve output is written straight out and the pager is empty.\n\n### Possible Solution\n\nWrite the useful output to STDOUT.\n\n### Additional Context\n\nSeems to be a problem with other messenger commands as well:\n\n```\nweb@eb.0:~$ bin/console cache:pool:list | wc -l\n21\nweb@eb.0:~$ bin/console messenger:stats | wc -l\n ----------------------- ------- \n  Transport               Count  \n ----------------------- ------- \n  high                    0      \n  low                     0      \n  failed                  1583   \n ----------------------- ------- \n\n0\n```","closed_by":{"login":"nicolas-grekas","id":243674,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0MzY3NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/243674?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicolas-grekas","html_url":"https://github.com/nicolas-grekas","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicolas-grekas/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicolas-grekas/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicolas-grekas/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicolas-grekas/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicolas-grekas/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicolas-grekas/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicolas-grekas/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicolas-grekas/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicolas-grekas/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/symfony/symfony/issues/60822/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/symfony/symfony/issues/60822/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
