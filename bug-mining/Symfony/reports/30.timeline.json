shows\r\n\r\n```Locale Comparison\r\n=================\r\nComparing `en_US` with `pt_BR`\r\n------------------------------\r\nComparison between Brazilian portuguese and English\r\n---------------------------------------------------\r\nIn` ByteString.php line 444:\r\n  Invalid \"UTF-8\" string.\r\n```  \r\n\r\nSo I added error logging just before the error message to identify the string: `string(59) \"�lido. Escolha um nome diferente, ou clique em 'sugestão'.\"`\r\n\r\nSearching for that string:\r\n` ack 'Escolha um nome diferente' .\r\napp/sprinkles/sprinkle-account/app/locale/pt_BR/messages.php\r\n144:        'NOT_AVAILABLE' => 'Usuário <strong>{{user_name}}</strong> não é válido. Escolha um nome diferente, ou clique em \\'sugestão\\'.',`\r\n\r\nSo the error is coming from `v**á**lido` in the string above.\r\n\r\nRunning a similar comparison using a different language also results in errors, eg `php bakery locale:compare -l en_US -r fr_FR` shows an error for `string(20) \"� la page d'accueil.\"`\n\n### Steps To Reproduce\n\n_No response_","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/userfrosting/UserFrosting/issues/1265/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/userfrosting/UserFrosting/issues/1265/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/symfony/symfony/issues/comments/2354328864","html_url":"https://github.com/symfony/symfony/issues/58286#issuecomment-2354328864","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/symfony/symfony/issues/58286","id":2354328864,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAAb9Ss6MVDUg","user":{"login":"stof","id":439401,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzOTQwMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/439401?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/stof","html_url":"https://github.com/stof","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stof/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stof/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stof/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stof/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stof/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stof/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stof/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stof/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stof/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-09-17T01:30:33Z","updated_at":"2024-09-17T01:30:33Z","body":"Just replacing `substr` with `mb_substr` would break things entirely (even for cases where the current logic is lucky enough to avoid breaking UTF-8 codepoints). `mb_substr` expects an offset computed in codepoints, not in bytes, so the computation of the offset needs to be changed as well","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/symfony/symfony/issues/comments/2354328864/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"stof","id":439401,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzOTQwMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/439401?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/stof","html_url":"https://github.com/stof","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stof/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stof/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stof/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stof/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stof/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stof/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stof/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stof/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stof/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/symfony/symfony/issues/comments/2733146422","html_url":"https://github.com/symfony/symfony/issues/58286#issuecomment-2733146422","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/symfony/symfony/issues/58286","id":2733146422,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAAb9Ss6i6IE2","user":{"login":"carsonbot","id":13338611,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMzM4NjEx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13338611?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/carsonbot","html_url":"https://github.com/carsonbot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/carsonbot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/carsonbot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/carsonbot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/carsonbot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/carsonbot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/carsonbot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/carsonbot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/carsonbot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/carsonbot/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-03-18T13:03:46Z","updated_at":"2025-03-18T13:03:46Z","body":"Hey, thanks for your report!\nThere has not been a lot of activity here for a while.

Bug report\n\nSince I've update to phpstan 2.1.19 I've got a error when analysing my project.\nThe problem is unfortunatly not reproducible on phpstan playground but I reproduced it on debian bullseye (php 7.4.33), ubuntu 24.10 (php 8.3.11) and mageia Cauldron (php 8.4.10) using phar or composer installed phpstan\n\nwhen analysing with phpstan level 7 or above, I'v got the following error:\n```console\n$ ./phpstan-2.1.19.phar analyze --level=7  bug-phpstan-2.1.19.php \n 1/1 [▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓] 100%\n\n\nIn ByteString.php line 370:\n                           \n

and got the same error than with phpstan 2.1.18\n\n```console\n$ ./phpstan-2.1.19.phar analyze --level=7  bug-phpstan-2.1.19.php \n 1/1 [▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓] 100%\n\n ------
