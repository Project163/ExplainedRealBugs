reach out to you following the renaming of `resources` folder to `builtins` in https://github.com/WICG/sanitizer-api/commit/5c473c2c6fdec4f87bf686488bf433da4ff7dc99  and the associated format change in json data.\n\nActually, the Symfony test suite for the HtmlSanitizer component was referencing these files. ([Example of CI run failing following the change](https://github.com/symfony/symfony/actions/runs/12812141426/job/35723104039?pr=59525)). \n\nI'd like to know if the renaming of the `resources` is fully intentional and will stay (thus I would update out test suite) or if maintainers here think that it might change in a near future ? \n\nSame question for the files. I don't see an equivalent of the `resources/baseline-element-allow-list.json` & `resources/baseline-attribute-allow-list.json` in the new version of the repository.\n\nThanks in advance for your answers and have a good day.\n\nping
