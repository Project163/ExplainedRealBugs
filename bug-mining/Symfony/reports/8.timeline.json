use case where the added `@final` annotation creates noise.\r\n\r\nFOSRestBundle has an [extended `Route` attribute](https://github.com/FriendsOfSymfony/FOSRestBundle/blob/3.x/Controller/Annotations/Route.php) that allows defining routes supporting a single HTTP method with an attribute that is a bit easier to consume (instead of `#[Route('/api/v1/posts', methods: ['GET'])]` you can use `#[Get('/api/v1/posts')]` and get the same configuration).\r\n\r\nI know I've seen the argument that attributes can't be extended to add functionality as the loaders wouldn't know what to do with it so they should be treated as final, but the `@final` annotations also effectively make adding extended attributes for repeated configurations like the OP has or for DX shortcuts like FOSRestBundle's pointless as it adds noise to the deprecation logs.","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/symfony/symfony/issues/comments/1883189979/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"mbabker","id":368545,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2ODU0NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/368545?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbabker","html_url":"https://github.com/mbabker","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbabker/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbabker/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbabker/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbabker/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbabker/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbabker/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbabker/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbabker/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbabker/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/symfony/symfony/issues/comments/1883192467","html_url":"https://github.com/symfony/symfony/issues/53467#issuecomment-1883192467","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/symfony/symfony/issues/53467","id":1883192467,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAAb9Ss5wPzyT","user":{"login":"nicolas-grekas","id":243674,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0MzY3NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/243674?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicolas-grekas","html_url":"https://github.com/nicolas-grekas","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicolas-grekas/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicolas-grekas/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicolas-grekas/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicolas-grekas/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicolas-grekas/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicolas-grekas/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicolas-grekas/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicolas-grekas/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicolas-grekas/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-01-09T14:50:39Z","updated_at":"2024-01-09T14:50:39Z","body":"PR
