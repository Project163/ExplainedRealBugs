Even if it does not always cause a DB lock on that table, it makes the query unnecessarily slow.\n\n### Possible Solution\n\nMove the `queue_name` to higher in the where clause.\n\n### Additional Context\n\n_No response_","closed_by":{"login":"fabpot","id":47313,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3MzEz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47313?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fabpot","html_url":"https://github.com/fabpot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fabpot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fabpot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fabpot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fabpot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fabpot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fabpot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fabpot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fabpot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fabpot/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/symfony/symfony/issues/52273/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/symfony/symfony/issues/52273/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
