MIT\r\n\r\nAdd caches to `TypeContextFactory` method to prevent multiple parsing of the same classes by PHPStan property extractor.\r\n\r\n1. Add cache to intermediate `TypeContext` creation from `createFromClassName()` and `createFromReflection()` by adding:\r\n\r\n   - `intermediateTypeContextCache` proprety.\r\n   - `createIntermediateTypeContext()` create the intermediate `TypeContext` if not found in cache.\r\n\r\n2. Add cache to `createFromClassName()` by:\r\n\r\n   - `typeContextCache` proprety.\r\n   - extracting `TypeContext` creation to private `createNewInstanceFromClassName()` method.\r\n   - refactoring `createFromClassName()` to get the `TypeContext` from `$this->typeContextCache`, or creating it by calling `createNewInstanceFromClassName()` method.\r\n\r\n3. Add a test to check that the results are cached.\r\n\r\nThis optimize deserialization and form validation.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/symfony/symfony/issues/61765/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/symfony/symfony/issues/61765/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/symfony/symfony/issues/comments/3296285548","html_url":"https://github.com/symfony/symfony/issues/61725#issuecomment-3296285548","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/symfony/symfony/issues/61725","id":3296285548,"node_id":"IC_kwDOAAb9Ss7EeVNs","user":{"login":"landure","id":1490071,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0OTAwNzE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1490071?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/landure","html_url":"https://github.com/landure","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/landure/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/landure/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/landure/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/landure/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/landure/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/landure/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/landure/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/landure/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/landure/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2025-09-16T07:38:47Z","updated_at":"2025-09-16T07:38:47Z","body":"Hi, I've just created a more refined pull request that implement a result cache.\n\nI believe it should be possible to cache the `createFromReflection()` method results, but I'm not sufficiently aware of how its used to add it to this PR.\n\n`createFromClassName()` is sufficiently predictable to allow caching.","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/symfony/symfony/issues/comments/3296285548/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"landure","id":1490071,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0OTAwNzE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1490071?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/landure","html_url":"https://github.com/landure","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/landure/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/landure/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/landure/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/landure/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/landure/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/landure/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/landure/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/landure/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/landure/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":19719770238,"node_id":"REFE_lADOAAb9Ss7K-zc1zwAAAASXY9B-","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/symfony/symfony/issues/events/19719770238","actor":{"login":"landure","id":1490071,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0OTAwNzE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1490071?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/landure","html_url":"https://github.com/landure","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/landure/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/landure/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/landure/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/landure/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/landure/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/landure/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/landure/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/landure/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/landure/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"8a9f8b58c8443082b890a94f8970d504f825dd8c","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/landure/symfony/commits/8a9f8b58c8443082b890a94f8970d504f825dd8c","created_at":"2025-09-16T08:24:31Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":19719835320,"node_id":"REFE_lADOAAb9Ss7K-zc1zwAAAASXZM64","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/symfony/symfony/issues/events/19719835320","actor":{"login":"landure","id":1490071,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0OTAwNzE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1490071?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/landure","html_url":"https://github.com/landure","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/landure/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/landure/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/landure/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/landure/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/landure/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/landure/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/landure/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/landure/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/landure/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"a29f10ba45633602a9b75b4090779405972542b8","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/landure/symfony/commits/a29f10ba45633602a9b75b4090779405972542b8","created_at":"2025-09-16T08:27:11Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":19719956577,"node_id":"REFE_lADOAAb9Ss7K-zc1zwAAAASXZqhh","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/symfony/symfony/issues/events/19719956577","actor":{"login":"landure","id":1490071,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0OTAwNzE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1490071?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/landure","html_url":"https://github.com/landure","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/landure/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/landure/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/landure/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/landure/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/landure/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/landure/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/landure/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/landure/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/landure/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"defb034cf23fa23656668
