yes, I understand the mechanism pretty well and attempted to summarize above. But I am not sure of the point you are trying to make here?\r\n\r\n My interest is not in figuring out what to blame (I agree that relying on internal parts of another library is not a good idea) but to figure out how to try to contain further version incompatibilities. Since Jackson versions up to 2.9.x will be bound to dependencies of Avro lib 1.8.x, it is not possible to upgrade to later Avro library there; and anything using Jackson 2.9.x Avro module can not use apache Avro 1.9.x or above.\r\nBut there is further problem that if with 2.10 we upgrade dependency here, it will then require upgrade of apache avro library for any mixed use cases.\r\nAlternatively it would be possible keep status quo for Jackson 2.x and not upgrade to apache avro 1.9.x and beyond; and wait for Jackson 3.0 to make the jump.\r\n\r\nNote, too, that Avro module is only relying on Jackson 1.x types because Avro 1.8.x exposes default values using 1.x `JsonNode` values; and internal `JacksonUtils` class seems to have been referenced for necessary conversions (I did not write code in question and failed to notice reference on code review); but even without it, reference to 1.x types is unavoidable before new

I've done a bit of digging, and there's some good news and some bad news:\r\n\r\n1. *Good*: jackson-dataformat-avro can be made binary compatible with both 1.8.X and 1.9.X without too much work. We were leveraging some Avro helper utils to avoid duplicating the code and increase the likelihood of remaining api-compatible as things evolved. These just need to be replaced with fresh code that lives in jackson-dataformat-avro. Slightly increases the risk of api-compatibility (specifically around how default values are encoded and interpreted in schemas), but all of the regression tests still pass with 1.8.X and I expect the use-cases to be limited to a domain of types that shouldn't have compatability issues.\r\n2. *Bad*: Avro changed the way they encode type information in schemas. In 1.8.X, nested classes were encoded as\r\n\r\n        {\"type\":\"record\",\"namespace\":\"package.OuterClass$\",\"name\":\"InnerClass\", ....}\r\n\r\n    Which was really helpful, because you could tell the difference between a nested class and a top-level class, and that made runtime type discovery relatively easy because these could be unambiguously concatenated and then fed into `Class.forName()` to find the type during deserialization. However, with 1.9.X, they've started serializing nested classes sans the trailing `$` in the namespace:\r\n\r\n        {\"type\":\"record\",\"namespace\":\"package.OuterClass\",\"name\":\"InnerClass\", ....}\r\n\r\n    Which we can no longer simply feed into `Class.forName()`, and now have to do a \"Guess and check\" by probing both the non-nested and nested combinations of namespace+name. _This makes 1.9.X not forwards compatible with 1.8.X over the wire._ \r\n\r\nThe unit tests catch this pretty handily (all of the \"Apache(1.9.X) -> Jackson w/ Apache(1.9.X) schema\" round-trip tests start failing, while their counterparts do not), and once fixed reveal a handful of other edge cases that need to be looked at. It appears that most of the other failing unit tests are similarly related to this issue, in the forms of Enums not resolving correctly or Unions not resolving correctly because we had relied upon Avro helpers to resolve these situations in a compatible manner; It looks like they will have to be rewritten and kept in sync instead.\r\n\r\nIn general, I recommend staying away from 1.9.X unless you're prepared to upgrade your whole ecosystem (or at least every consumer) all at once because the schema format is not forwards compatible. I think these can all be worked around/fixed/patched so that Jackson can read from both versions and write from both versions without any major overhauls/work, but we do need to clone&own some pieces we were leveraging from Avro.","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-dataformats-binary/issues/comments/515611912/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"baharclerode","id":9274903,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyNzQ5MDM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9274903?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/baharclerode","html_url":"https://github.com/baharclerode","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baharclerode/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baharclerode/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baharclerode/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baharclerode/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baharclerode/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baharclerode/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baharclerode/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baharclerode/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baharclerode/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-dataformats-binary/issues/comments/515615847","html_url":"https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-dataformats-binary/issues/167#issuecomment-515615847","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-dataformats-binary/issues/167","id":515615847,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUxNTYxNTg0Nw==","user":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder","html_url":"https://github.com/cowtowncoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-07-26T22:17:52Z","updated_at":"2019-07-26T22:17:52Z","body":"@baharclerode Thank you for digging bit deeper!

karaf features](https://karaf.apache.org/manual/latest/provisioning) are used by [Apache karaf](https://karaf.apache.org) to load runtime dependencies.\r\n\r\nWhen using features karaf is very clever at finding and correctly loading run-time dependencies. The startup problems familiar to developers of OSGi applications are a non-issue when using karaf features to load the applications.\r\n\r\nA manually created third party jackson karaf feature exist https://github.com/Code-House/karaf-jackson but that feature isn't actively maintained (last commit was one year ago for jackson 2.8.11). I also have a feature loading some jackson artifacts in my jersey karaf feature https://github.com/steinarb/jersey-karaf-feature (which I will happily abandon if jackson and jersey start providing their own karaf features).\r\n\r\nUsing the [karaf-maven-plugin](https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/karaf/site/production/manual/latest/karaf-maven-plugin.html) it is possible to piggyback the creation of karaf features during the regular build.  I.e. the features would be created and released with jackson.\r\n\r\nThe artifacts created by the karaf-maven-plugin consists of attachments with classifier features and type xml to the jar file/OSGi bundle artifacts.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the feature file attachment of the karaf-maven-plugin, for my own projects, I usually create a semi-manual features.xml file attachment to the top pom, that aggregates all of the feature files of the jar files/OSGi bundle projects.  This means I only need to load a single feature file to have all of the features available.\r\n\r\nIf there is interest in having a jackson karaf feature (or actually: set of features), I can provide a pull request.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/2434/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-databind/issues/2434/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-dataformats-binary/issues/comments/550314540","html_url":"https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-dataformats-binary/issues/167#issuecomment-550314540","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-dataformats-binary/issues/167","id":550314540,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU1MDMxNDU0MA==","user":{"login":"dani-e-l","id":23003886,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMDAzODg2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/23003886?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dani-e-l","html_url":"https://github.com/dani-e-l","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dani-e-l/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dani-e-l/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dani-e-l/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dani-e-l/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dani-e-l/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dani-e-l/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dani-e-l/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dani-e-l/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dani-e-l/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-11-06T13:44:18Z","updated_at":"2019-11-06T13:44:18Z","body":"Hi cowtowncoder\r\nare you working on this?\r\n\r\nAvro 1.8.x has vulnerabilities and we need to update avro or remove jackson-dataformats-binary from our projects.\r\nIs there any possibility to support 1.9.x in short term?\r\n\r\n","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-dataformats-binary/issues/comments/550314540/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"dani-e-l","id":23003886,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMDAzODg2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/23003886?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dani-e-l","html_url":"https://github.com/dani-e-l","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dani-e-l/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dani-e-l/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dani-e-l/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dani-e-l/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dani-e-l/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dani-e-l/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dani-e-l/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dani-e-l/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dani-e-l/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-dataformats-binary/issues/comments/550428874","html_url":"https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-dataformats-binary/issues/167#issuecomment-550428874","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-dataformats-binary/issues/167","id":550428874,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU1MDQyODg3NA==","user":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder","html_url":"https://github.com/cowtowncoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-11-06T17:59:55Z","updated_at":"2020-02-29T00:38:21Z","body":"No, I do not plan to work on this.

A couple of quick points:\r\n\r\n1. Name validation can be turned off in [Schema.Parser](https://github.com/apache/avro/blob/master/lang/java/avro/src/main/java/org/apache/avro/Schema.java#L1331).  It's probably not _great_ to use non-standard names across platforms/languages, but it's possible.\r\n1. The schema can store other metadata. The `java-class` attribute is probably a good bet to store the Java class name!\r\n1. There shouldn't be any problem with forward/backward compatibility strictly \"over-the-wire\" (I sincerely hope!) Binary serialization doesn't include name information at all.  However, it's probably possible for the 1.8.x Java implementation to create an Avro file with a \"bad\" schema, or store it in a registry, etc.\r\n\r\n+1 to helping get this working for
