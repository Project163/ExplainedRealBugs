json, I could always extend an enum (on both sender and receiver ends), consider it a backwards compatible change,  and the receiver could parse both old and new documents equally well.\r\n\r\nWith avro, altering an enum makes the entire schema incompatible, and an updated schema can not be used to read old docs.\r\nFor all my use cases, serialising all enums as string would be a completely acceptable strategy for avoiding this problem, and much preferable to versioned formats,\r\nbut jacksons avro support does not currently seem to offer this.  \r\n\r\nSo I'm hoping for a new feature switch for avro: WRITE_ENUMS_AS_STRINGS or similar.\r\n \r\nIn my case I only really care about serialising, since the receiver is on a completely different platform, but I guess parity on the deserialising side would be natural to include.","closed_by":{"login":"cowtowncoder","id":55065,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55065?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder","html_url":"https://github.com/cowtowncoder","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cowtowncoder/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-dataformats-binary/issues/494/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FasterXML/jackson-dataformats-binary/issues/494/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
