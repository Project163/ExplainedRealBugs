FYI, I implemented support for this but decided to revert it. The point is that `<transition>` should be wrapping the direct node that is being manipulated by `v-show` or `v-if`. When you use `v-show` or `v-if` inside the component, it becomes indirect and imo ends up being harder to reason about.\n\nSo there are two options for the use case:\n1. Use both `<transition>` and `v-show` in the parent scope.\n2. Use both `<transition>` and `v-show` inside the child component. In this case you can also allow the user to pass in props to customize the transition.\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vuejs/vue/issues/comments/239989389/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"yyx990803","id":499550,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5OTU1MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/499550?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yyx990803","html_url":"https://github.com/yyx990803","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yyx990803/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yyx990803/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yyx990803/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yyx990803/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yyx990803/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yyx990803/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yyx990803/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yyx990803/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yyx990803/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":756482237,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50NzU2NDgyMjM3","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vuejs/vue/issues/events/756482237","actor":{"login":"miljan-aleksic","id":513275,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxMzI3NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/513275?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/miljan-aleksic","html_url":"https://github.com/miljan-aleksic","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miljan-aleksic/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miljan-aleksic/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miljan-aleksic/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miljan-aleksic/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miljan-aleksic/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miljan-aleksic/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miljan-aleksic/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miljan-aleksic/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miljan-aleksic/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2016-08-16T03:03:20Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":756482238,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDc1NjQ4MjIzOA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vuejs/vue/issues/events/756482238","actor":{"login":"miljan-aleksic","id":513275,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxMzI3NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/513275?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/miljan-aleksic","html_url":"https://github.com/miljan-aleksic","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miljan-aleksic/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miljan-aleksic/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miljan-aleksic/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miljan-aleksic/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miljan-aleksic/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miljan-aleksic/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miljan-aleksic/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miljan-aleksic/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miljan-aleksic/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2016-08-16T03:03:20Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vuejs/vue/issues/comments/239992649","html_url":"https://github.com/vuejs/vue/issues/3431#issuecomment-239992649","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vuejs/vue/issues/3431","id":239992649,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIzOTk5MjY0OQ==","user":{"login":"miljan-aleksic","id":513275,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxMzI3NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/513275?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/miljan-aleksic","html_url":"https://github.com/miljan-aleksic","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miljan-aleksic/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miljan-aleksic/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miljan-aleksic/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miljan-aleksic/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miljan-aleksic/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miljan-aleksic/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miljan-aleksic/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miljan-aleksic/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miljan-aleksic/rece
