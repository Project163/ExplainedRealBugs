Despite the fact, that it uses `getOwnPropertyDescriptor` to respect user-defined getters and setters. \r\n\r\n---\r\nI faced this problem in a context of lazy-loaded backend entities. I have some redux store selectors, that returns RESTfull models. Some of the models nested properties are wrapped into getters, so I can call them, if needed and trigger a background api request for additional info. Now, all of the getters are invoked immediately and a bunch of requests is sent after initial rendering.\r\n\r\nI can do a pull request, to fix this, but may be I do not understand some concept under this behaviour. \r\n\r\nSorry for bad english. \r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.
