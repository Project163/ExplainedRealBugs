I have 2 functional components in the repro (`Logo.vue` / `LogoWrapper.vue`)\r\n2.) The components are registered globally as async components (doesn't really make sense in this case.. but you should get the point :-)). Check `components/_globals.js`\r\n3.) Using one of the component in the other (Logo inside LogoWrapper) breaks with the errormessage \"Cannot read property '$on' of null\" - this was working prior to 2.6.8\r\n\r\n\r\n### What is expected?\r\nComponents are renderer, no error message.\r\n\r\n### What is actually happening?\r\nTypeError\r\nCannot read property '$on' of null\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.
