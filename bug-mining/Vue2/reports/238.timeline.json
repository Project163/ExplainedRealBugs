Click on the working checkbox. The v-model value updates and the \"updated\" lifecycle event fires a console log.\r\n2. Click on the \"busted\" checkbox, which is the same markup as the working checkbox, but wrapped within a div inside the DynamicWrap component. \r\n\r\nNotice that the checkbox appears checked, but the v-model doesn't update and the \"updated\" lifecycle event of the checkbox never fires.\r\n\r\n\r\n### What is expected?\r\nThe second checkbox's v-model updates correctly\r\n\r\n### What is actually happening?\r\nNo updated lifecycle event fires, the v-model is not updated.\r\n\r\n---\r\nWhat's happening:\r\nThe DynamicWrapper is rerendered after mount when the UnwrappedCheckbox is created inside of its default slot. UnwrappedCheckbox uses provide/inject to update the DynamicWrap component to wrap it with a 'div' instead of a 'label' element. This clones the content inside, but once the Checkbox is nested a layer deeper, it stops behaving as expected.\r\n\r\nSorry for the monster title and complex replication, let me know if there's anything more I can do to clarify. For context, the purpose of this DynamicWrapper is to act as a type of \"FormItem\" component. It wraps any element placed inside of the component (In this case a Checkbox) with a label element unless it's something like a Checkbox or Radio. We have our own Checkbox and Radio, that we'd like to tell the FormItem to unwrap the label if a Checkbox is placed inside it.\r\n\r\nI've also tested in the beta prerelease and the issue remains.\r\n\r\nPossible related previous issues:\r\nhttps://github.com/vuejs/vue/issues/6372\r\nhttps://github.com/vuejs/vue/issues/6915\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.
