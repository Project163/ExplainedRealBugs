Create mixin that sets the `inject` option\r\n2. Create component that uses said mixin\r\n3. Use component in context with a corresponding `provide`\r\n\r\n### What is expected?\r\nThe data provided in the context is correctly injected into the component that uses the mixin with the `inject` option set.\r\n\r\n### What is actually happening?\r\nThe data provided is _not_ injected into the component that uses the mixin, unless the `inject` option is specified directly on the component and not in the mixin.\r\n\r\n---\r\nI use the pattern of specifying `provide` and `inject` options on mixins extensively, as this provides some really useful [mixins for specifying relationships between different components](https://github.com/kasperisager/vue-relation). A component using a `hasOne()` mixin would for example `provide` itself to a child which would then use a `memberOf()` mixin to `inject` the parent. As of Vue 2.4.0 , this however no longer works as the `inject` option of the `memberOf()` mixin is ignored.\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.
