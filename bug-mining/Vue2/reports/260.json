And only `countA` changed.\r\n\r\n### What is actually happening?\r\nWhen I click `Expand is Ture`, nothing happened.\r\nThe `countA` and `countB` changed.\r\nI guess when I click, `expand` changed to `false`, but immediate the click event triggered. It executes another vnode click event. Then expand changed to `true`.\r\n\r\n### And More\r\n\r\n* If I rename the second div to another tag name, such as `p`, `section`, no errors occur.\r\n* If I move click event from `i` tag to parent `div` tag in the first div, no errors occur\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.
