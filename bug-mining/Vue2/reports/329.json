Click Toggle Slide to enable transition, which is currently not working\r\n2. If you remove the scrollTop layout calculations in beforeSlideEnter, the element will slide in smoothly. Now the transition is working.\r\n\r\n### What is expected?\r\nGradual sliding in from right\r\n\r\n### What is actually happening?\r\nWith scrollTop calculations, the entering transition is gone.\r\n\r\n---\r\nI have found that wrapping the child component in an additional div will solve this problem. However, this seems like a hack.\r\n\r\nI apologize if this is not a bug. I have raised this questions in forum, discord and stackoverflow but no one is able to answer. So I have started to think that it might be a bug.\r\n\r\n### Stackoverflow Link\r\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/questions/48420077/beforeenter-hook-on-child-component-transition-cancelled-by-scrolltop-layout-cal\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.
