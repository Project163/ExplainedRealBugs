However, in some mobile browsers, such as iOS Safari、iOS Wechat Webview、Android Chrome，it can not play.\r\n\r\n---\r\nIn Vue 2.4  or below, the `nextTick` function use `microTask`, like `MutationObserver` or `Promise` at first，the click callback and audio play function are in the same tick，so it can play well in all browsers.\r\n\r\nHowerver, in Vue 2.5 ，`macroTask` will be used in DOM action, so  the click callback and audio play function are not in the same tick. If we just use `setTimeout 0`, it will be fine, but actually `MessageChannel` will be firstly used because of the priority, which lead to the audio can not play in some mobile browsers mentioned above.\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.
