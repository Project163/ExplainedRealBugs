Create `<input type=\"checkbox\" :value=\"[1]\" />`\r\n2. Bind it to an array using `v-model`.\r\n\r\n### What is expected?\r\nToggling the checkbox will add/remove the `value` array to the `v-model` array.\r\n\r\n### What is actually happening?\r\nToggling the checkbox adds the contents of the `value` array to the `v-model` array. Checkbox is not toggled and contents are added as many times as clicked.\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.
