This happens because in SSR computed property don't receive component's instance as the first argument, therefore I cannot access `$store` property. I am not sure if this is a bug or not, I think it is because i could not find anything about in vue or vue-ssr docs. I would appreciate if someone could clarify this issue. Thank you :)\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.
