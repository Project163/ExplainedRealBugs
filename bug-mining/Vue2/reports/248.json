Open the http://jsfiddle.net/zjsuzqgu/15/ with IE 11\r\n2. Quickly enter text into the second textarea (maybe you should press 3 buttons at same time)\r\n\r\nWe used a barcode scanner to enter the texts, but its also possible to reproduce it with the keyboard.\r\nWe also recognized that it happens more often on slow machines\r\n\r\n### What is expected?\r\nAll keys are recognized\r\n\r\n### What is actually happening?\r\nSome letters are missing randomly\r\n\r\n---\r\nWe made a video of this behaviour: https://youtu.be/w-IYuPBGdR0\r\n\r\nYou could reproduce this even on the vuejs page https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/forms.html#Text\r\n\r\nI just added a v-on:input to the textarea to see whats logged there. \r\nThe result was \r\nA\r\nA\r\nAC\r\nAC\r\n\r\nThe B was never recognized even in input event\r\n\r\nI also changed the intercharacter delay of the scanner from 1 ms to 25 ms without success\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.
