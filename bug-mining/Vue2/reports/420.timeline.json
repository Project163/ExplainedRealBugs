What problem does this feature solve?\r\nCompiler automatically condense whitespace between elements (to a certain extent, controllable with `whitespace` option).\r\n\r\nIt does not condense spaces inside attributes. This can't be done in general because some whitespaces inside `data-mine` could be significant, but there are two well-known attributes that have non-significant whitespace and could easily be large: `style` and `css` (more could be added to the list).\r\n\r\nHere we use prettier, which formats code in its own way -- and puts attributes on multiple lines when they're too big.\r\nWe also use Tailwind, which means we sometimes end up with a lot of classes on one tag.\r\n\r\nCombine both and this markup is not unheard of in our codebase:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3832820/128224208-d062e195-d235-4d45-8529-1c0cb9b37b24.png)\r\n\r\nSince class whitespace is kept as-is by compiler, our production build contains very noticeable \"holes\" that needlessly contribute to its size:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3832820/128224315-5a9a2b0c-e7b2-4db0-aa02-3482af3d4ec4.png)\r\n\r\nIf you look closely you see two elements whose `css` attribute is ~50% space for ~50% content.\r\n\r\n> **Edge case**: should we pay attention to spaces inside quotes for `style`? I can't come up with a reasonable example where this might be significant, but in theory it might. `content: '   '` could be significant ws, except `content` is only useful in generated content -> not in an inline style.\r\n\r\n### What does the proposed API look like?\r\nNo new API. \r\nThe difference is in build output: `style` and `class` attributes should always have their whitespace condensed.\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.
