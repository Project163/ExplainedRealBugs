do you mean by \"cancel\"? Are you trying to interrupt an ongoing animation and make it snap to the end state, or to \"turn off\" the transition so that it doesn't trigger anymore?\n\nIn either case, setting the bound class to `null` or empty string is the wrong way to do it. There's no way to \"interrupt\" an already triggered transition, but you can revert it by toggling the state controlling the element inside.\n\nAs for \"turning off\", we could probably add a `disabled` prop for transition components.
