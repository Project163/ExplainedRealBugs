Add render() and beforeUpdate() hook to the instance.\r\n2. Trigger data value change by any means\r\n\r\n### What is expected?\r\nPer the API\r\n\r\nhttps://vuejs.org/v2/api/index.html#beforeUpdate\r\n\r\nbeforeUpdate is supposed to be fired before render(), and state changes in this hook should not trigger additional re-renders.\r\n\r\n### What is actually happening?\r\nbeforeUpdate() is actually invoked after render() in current version 2.5.13.\r\n\r\n---\r\nThis could result in infinite update loop, as state changes in beforeUpdate() will trigger another re-rendering.\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.
