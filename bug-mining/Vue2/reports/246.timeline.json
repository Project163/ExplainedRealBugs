the following warning:\r\n\r\n```\r\nThe client-side rendered virtual DOM tree is not matching server-rendered content.

`v-html` directive in a vue template.\r\n\r\nOpened issue on JSX: https://github.com/vuejs/babel-plugin-transform-vue-jsx/issues/90\r\n\r\nCurrent workaround is to check if `body` is a component or

 I ran into a similar issue in a functional component using innerHTML to render the entity `&times;`.  \r\n\r\nThe `&times;` is the default value for a functional component prop (which can be changed to other HTML markup by the user)\r\n\r\nSSR renders the inner HTML as `&times;`, but the browser when using innerHTML converts some entities to actual UTF-8 characters (i.e. `&times;` is converted by the browser, via native innerHTML,  to `×`)\r\n\r\nUltimately this causes rehydration to bail and re-render the component (and spew errors in dev mode)\r\n\r\nA few other HTML entities can also fail hydration when used in innerHTML: `&hellip;`, `&raquo;`, `&laquo;`, etc.\r\n\r\nMinimal markup to recreate SSR hydration bail issue:\r\n```js\r\nexport default {\r\n  functional: true,\r\n  props:
