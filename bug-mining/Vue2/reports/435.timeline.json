Unsure why we are hitting this despite a fix being merged in 2022 (using `\"vue\": \"^3.5.21\"` and `\"vue-tsc\": \"^3.0.7\"`), but I am adding some error output for posterity and to guide other desperate people scouring the web. \n\nThe type mismatches looking slightly different for us (making it harder to find this old low-engagement ticket): \n\n```\n error TS2769: No overload matches this call.\n  Overload 2 of 3, '(setup: (props: Record<string, any>, ctx: { attrs: Data; slots: Readonly<InternalSlot\ns>; emit: (event: string, ...args: any[]) => void; expose: <Exposed extends Record<string, any> = Record<\n...>>(exposed?: Exposed | undefined) => void; }) => RenderFunction | Promise<...>, options?: (Pick<...> &\n { ...; }) | undefined): DefineSetupFnComponent<...>', gave the following error.\n    Object literal may only specify known properties, and 'name' does not exist in type '(props: Record<s\ntring, any>, ctx: { attrs: Data; slots: Readonly<InternalSlots>; emit: (event: string, ...args: any[]) =>\n void; expose: <Exposed extends Record<string, any> = Record<...>>(exposed?: Exposed | undefined) => void\n; }) => RenderFunction | Promise<...>'.\n```\n\nRemoving the `name` prop just changed the error to say `Object literal may only specify known properties, and 'components' does not exist in type '(props: Record<string, any>, ctx: { attrs: Data; slots: Readonly<InternalSlots>; emit: (event: string, ...args: any[]) => void; expose: <Exposed extends Record<string, any> = Record<...>>(exposed?: Exposed | undefined) => void; }) => RenderFunction | Promise<...>'.ts-plugin(2769)`\n\nRemoving `components` changed it to `Object literal may only specify known properties, and 'props' does not exist in type '(props: Record<string, any>, ctx: { attrs: Data; slots: Readonly<InternalSlots>; emit: (event: string, ...args: any[]) => void; expose: <Exposed extends Record<string, any> = Record<...>>(exposed?: Exposed | undefined) => void; }) => RenderFunction | Promise<...>'.ts-plugin(2769)`\n\n…and so on and so forth.\n\n_Edit: It doesn't actually fix the type inference of computed properties. For that, manually overriding the type was required: https://stackoverflow.com/a/70983629/2836299_\n\n~The other manifestation of this issue is that computed variables are incorrectly inferred as `() -> ActualType` instead of `ActualType` resulting in errors like `Argument of type '() => ActualType' is not assignable to parameter of type 'ActualType'` and `error TS2322: Type 'Computed' is not assignable to type ActualType`, `error TS2339: Property 'computedVariableProp' does not exist on type 'Computed'.`, and ` error TS2488: Type 'Computed' must have a '[Symbol.iterator]()' method that returns an iterator.`, which I documented here: https://github.com/vuejs/language-tools/discussions/5629~","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vuejs/vue/issues/comments/3309219603/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"heyakyra","id":740361,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc0MDM2MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/740361?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/heyakyra","html_url":"https://github.com/heyakyra","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/heyakyra/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/heyakyra/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/heyakyra/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/heyakyra/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/heyakyra/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/heyakyra/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/heyakyra/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/heyakyra/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/heyakyra/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}}]
