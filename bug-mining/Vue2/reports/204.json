Open bug reproduction for 2.3.0 and check console.log - you ca see an error\r\n2. Make change in FormErrors component so it will return empty `span` tag  instead of `null` value at the end - no error this time and the example works fine\r\n\r\n### What is expected?\r\ni expect the above example to work as it did in vue@2.2.6\r\n\r\n### What is actually happening?\r\nVue throws an error `Uncaught TypeError: Cannot set property 'isRootInsert' of null` when functional component returns null value instead of vnode.\r\n\r\n// EDIT: Also something I noticed in 2.3.0. If you will return `undefined` instead of `null` at the end of FormErrors, then our example works again.\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.
