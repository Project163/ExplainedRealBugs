reproduce\r\n```\r\n$ vue init webpack-simple .\r\n$ npm install vue@2.0.7 vue-template-compiler@2.0.7\r\n```\r\n\r\n```vue\r\n<template>\r\n<div>\r\n    <section style=\"text-align: center\" v-if=\"loading\">\r\n        Should be centered.\r\n    </section>\r\n    <section style=\"margin-top: 6rem;\" v-if=\"!loading\">\r\n        Should not be centered.\r\n

inline styles from old vnodes.\r\n\r\n### What is actually happening?\r\nDuring the update operation, patched elements will retain styles from vnodes that will no longer exist in the DOM.\r\n\r\nTemporarily solution for end-users: changing inline styles to classes, choosing different tag names or adding a `key` directive will fix the issue. Thanks to @LinusBorg for the latter.\r\n\r\nIt looks like this PR has introduced this regression https://github.com/vuejs/vue/pull/4138.
