In this particular repo (vue hacker news 2.0) it fails the first time, but for some reason, it works for a subsequent request. The same thing works just fine if it's done in the browser (non-ssr).\r\n\r\n### What is expected?\r\nNo errors thrown, correct HTML produced on the server.\r\n\r\n### What is actually happening?\r\nAn error is thrown on the console, HTML not produced at all.\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.
