Vue.js & vue-router.js version\n\n2.0.0-rc.1, 2.0.0-rc.3\n### Reproduction Link\n\nhttp://codepen.io/analog-nico/pen/KrJgqN\n### Steps to reproduce\n1. Check the \"I agree\" checkbox\n2. Click \"Sign Up\"\n3. The router successfully navigates to the second page\n4. Click \"Go back\"\n5. Leave the \"I agree\" checkbox unchecked\n6. Click \"Sign Up\"\n7. An error message above the checkbox is shown\n8. Check the \"I agree\" checkbox\n9. Click \"Sign Up\"\n### What is Expected?\n- Again, the router should successfully navigate to the second page.\n### What is actually happening?\n1. Vue.js is rebuilding the DOM after `this.errorAgreement = false` was set and thus the DOM element for the error message gets removed. All DOM elements below the error message get reinserted.\n2. While the rebuilding takes place `self.$router.push({ path: '/done' })` is executed and - i guess - starts to destroy the page in order to navigate to the second one.\n3. Vue.js produces an error because it wants to insert a node before another node that doesn't exist anymore: \"NotFoundError: DOM Exception 8: An attempt was made to reference a Node in a context where it does not exist.\"\n4. The crash is visible by the two \"Sign Up\" buttons that appeared. The first one was newly inserted. The second one is the original one which would have been removed if Vue.js hadn't crashed.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vuejs/vue-router/issues/610/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vuejs/vue-router/issues/610/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"actor":{"login":"ZakaryCode","id":24262362,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0MjYyMzYy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24262362?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZakaryCode","html_url":"https://github.com/ZakaryCode","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZakaryCode/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZakaryCode/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZakaryCode/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZakaryCode/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZakaryCode/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZakaryCode/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZakaryCode/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZakaryCode/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZakaryCode/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-01-26T07:28:30Z","updated_at":"2022-01-26T07:28:30Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/NervJS/taro/issues/11204","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/NervJS/taro","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/NervJS/taro/issues/11204/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/NervJS/taro/issues/11204/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/NervJS/taro/issues/11204/events","html_url":"https://github.com/NervJS/taro/issues/11204","id":1114612857,"node_id":"I_kwDOB6qnRc5Cb6R5","number":11204,"title":"H5

复现步骤\r\n开发h5碰到的问题有点摸不着头脑，已经尽量简化复现步骤了，希望大佬们能帮忙看看\r\n```\r\n<template>\r\n  <view class=\"c-test\">\r\n    <button @tap=\"activeType = 0\">loading</button>\r\n    <!-- <view> -->\r\n    <view v-if=\"activeType === 0\" class=\"main-contentsdsd\"> 1111111111</view>\r\n    <!-- </view> -->\r\n  </view>\r\n</template>\r\n\r\n<script>\r\nexport default {\r\n  data() {\r\n    return {\r\n      activeType: -1,\r\n    };\r\n  },\r\n};\r\n</script>\r\n```\r\n打开复现链接中项目的首页，点击button控制更新渲染，控制台出现报错并渲染失败\r\n```\r\nUncaught (in promise) DOMException: Failed to execute 'insertBefore' on 'Node': The node before which the new node is to be inserted is not a child of this node.\r\n```\r\n重点好像是v-if的元素被两个html注释快包着就会出现这个问题....\r\n\r\n### 期望结果\r\ndom正常渲染\r\n\r\n### 实际结果\r\n出现报错且dom渲染失败\r\n\r\n###
