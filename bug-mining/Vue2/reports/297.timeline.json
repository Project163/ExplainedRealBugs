Version\r\n2.7.0\r\n\r\n### Reproduction link\r\n[https://codesandbox.io/s/176k2vp03](https://codesandbox.io/s/176k2vp03)\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\n1. Run the codesandbox.io link.\r\n2. Notice that the component isn't rendered.\r\n3. Look at the console to see the unhandled error. \r\n4. In SSR and on the browser, this error isn't propagated to the usual error handler. In SSR I tested with `renderToString`\r\n5. In SSR the error does not use source maps and is very difficult to debug.\r\n\r\n## More info\r\n\r\nWhen using [VUE Router Lazy Loading](https://router.vuejs.org/en/advanced/lazy-loading.html), and there's an error outside of the component, the error is not propagated & the stack trace isn't cleaned up with source maps. Here's the gist of the minimal reproduction (linked):\r\n\r\ne.g.  `MyComponent.vue`\r\n```vue\r\n<script>\r\nthrow new Error('bad_error');\r\n\r\nexport default {\r\n  name: 'MyComponent'\r\n};\r\n</script>\r\n```\r\n\r\n`createRouter.js`\r\n```js\r\nconst MyComponent = () => import('./MyComponent.vue');\r\n\r\nexport default createRouter() {\r\n  return new Router({\r\n    routes: [\r\n      { path: '/', component: MyComponent }\r\n    ]\r\n  });\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nError in the logs:\r\n```\r\n[vue-router] Failed to resolve async component default: Error: bad_error\r\n[vue-router] uncaught error during route navigation:\r\n Error: bad_error\r\n     at Object.exports.modules.Array.concat.Object.defineProperty.value (0.server-bundle.js:12842:7)\r\n     at __webpack_require__ (server-bundle.js:27:30)\r\n    at Object.<anonymous> (0.server-bundle.js:12708:141)\r\n     at __webpack_require__ (server-bundle.js:27:30)\r\n     at Object.exports.modules.Array.concat.Object.de\r\n```\r\n\r\n### What is expected?\r\nI expect the error to be propagated to the `renderToString` err in the callback and the error to be rewritten using the source maps.\r\n\r\n### What is actually happening?\r\nWhen rendered with SSR, the page hangs, as the error is never propagated to `renderToString`'s `err` in the callback.\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.
