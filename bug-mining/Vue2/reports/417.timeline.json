If you look at my example and read my outline, I am talking about root level script tags. I clearly illustrate script tags wrapped in a node do not execute. \r\n\r\n> Root level `<script>` tags should not be executed, that needs a fix, but just for consistent behavior because it doesn't make it any safer. If you are allowing arbitrary injection into your templates, there are a million other XSS attack vectors by using binding expressions with `constructor` hack, or image src, etc. The moment you give up control of your template, your site is insecure. Fixing script execution under that situation is like patching a hole on a ship that is already underwater.\r\n\r\nWhilst again, i do agree that data validation/sanitization is ultimately up to the developer, in this particular situation the vulnerability lies in VUE as by  your own words \"this needs to be fixed for consistency\".  This vulnerability comes from the inconsistency. \r\n\r\n> If you are allowing arbitrary injection into your templates, there are a million other XSS attack vectors by using binding expressions with `constructor` hack, or image src, etc. \r\n\r\nThis only makes me wonder what other undiscovered vulnerabilities may lie in the core code. For example, does this mean escaping must be done on attributes bound to variables? \r\n\r\nAlso, if being unable to \"fully trust\" VUE to properly sanitize markup it generates, then what purpose does v-html actually serve? Why force users to use it at all?","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vuejs/vue/issues/comments/653251454/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"hybridwebdev","id":7633708,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc2MzM3MDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7633708?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hybridwebdev","html_url":"https://github.com/hybridwebdev","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hybridwebdev/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hybridwebdev/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hybridwebdev/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hybridwebdev/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hybridwebdev/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hybridwebdev/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hybridwebdev/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hybridwebdev/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hybridwebdev/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vuejs/vue/issues/comments/653307422","html_url":"https://github.com/vuejs/vue/issues/11483#issuecomment-653307422","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vuejs/vue/issues/11483","id":653307422,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY1MzMwNzQyMg==","user":{"login":"yyx990803","id":499550,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5OTU1MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/499550?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yyx990803","html_url":"https://github.com/yyx990803","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yyx990803/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yyx990803/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yyx990803/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yyx990803/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yyx990803/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yyx990803/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yyx990803/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yyx990803/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yyx990803/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-07-03T02:45:15Z","updated_at":"2020-07-03T03:07:48Z","body":"Similar to how you should not be using user-provided content as your template, we do not recommend using `v-html` to insert user-provided content either.
