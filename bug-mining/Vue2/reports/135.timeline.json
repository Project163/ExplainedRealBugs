Basically, I would expect both `myProp` and `missingProp` in the previous example to be the same.\r\n\r\n### What is actually happening?\r\nWhen the prop is not provided its content is casted to `false`. Also, some other values like `''` are casted to `true` (somewhat related to #4538) but I guess this is intended. I'm using `default: undefined` for now.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vuejs/vue/issues/4792/reactions","total_count":12,"+1":12,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vuejs/vue/issues/4792/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"actor":{"login":"Kingwl","id":6831019,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4MzEwMTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6831019?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kingwl","html_url":"https://github.com/Kingwl","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kingwl/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kingwl/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kingwl/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kingwl/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kingwl/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kingwl/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kingwl/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kingwl/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kingwl/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-06-23T10:47:18Z","updated_at":"2017-06-23T10:47:18Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vuejs/vue/issues/5959","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vuejs/vue","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vuejs/vue/issues/5959/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vuejs/vue/issues/5959/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vuejs/vue/issues/5959/events","html_url":"https://github.com/vuejs/vue/issues/5959","id":238105889,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWUyMzgxMDU4ODk=","number":5959,"title":"Passing empty string into boolean type prop result in true","user":{"login":"jkzing","id":2851517,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4NTE1MTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2851517?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkzing","html_url":"https://github.com/jkzing","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkzing/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkzing/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkzing/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkzing/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkzing/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkzing/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkzing/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkzing/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkzing/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":5,"created_at":"2017-06-23T10:38:27Z","updated_at":"2017-06-23T22:16:50Z","closed_at":"2017-06-23T22:16:50Z","author_association":"MEMBER","type":null,"active_lock_reason":null,"sub_issues_summary":{"total":0,"completed":0,"percent_completed":0},"issue_dependencies_summary":{"blocked_by":0,"total_blocked_by":0,"blocking":0,"total_blocking":0},"repository":{"id":11730342,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMTczMDM0Mg==","name":"vue","full_name":"vuejs/vue","private":false,"owner":{"login":"vuejs","id":6128107,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjYxMjgxMDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6128107?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vuejs","html_url":"https://github.com/vuejs","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vuejs/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vuejs/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vuejs/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vuejs/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vuejs/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vuejs/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vuejs/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vuejs/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vuejs/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/vuejs/vue","description":"This is the repo for Vue 2.
