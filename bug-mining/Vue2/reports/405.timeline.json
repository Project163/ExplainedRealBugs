Running the example unit test should pass successfully.\r\n\r\n### What is actually happening?\r\nThe unit test fails with a reference error from vue.runtime.esm.js. \r\n\r\n---\r\nThis is happening because vue 2.6.9 (which is installed by npm by default even though it is ahead of the latest stable release) references the global performance attribute that should be available in the browser on line 4251 of vue.runtime.esm.js, but it is not available in the globals provided by jsdom-global. I've made a pull request to jsdom-global (here: https://github.com/rstacruz/jsdom-global/pull/49) to fix its unavailability, but that repo doesn't seem to be actively maintained and it's doubtful that the fix will be merged anytime soon. It would probably be wise to use a different package or a fork of this one.  If it helps, you're welcome to use my fork which already has the fix: https://github.com/Cameron637/jsdom-global\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.
