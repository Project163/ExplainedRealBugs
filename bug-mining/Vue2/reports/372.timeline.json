Environment\r\n**Vuetify Version:** 2.1.9\r\n**Vue Version:** 2.6.10\r\n**Browsers:** Chrome 78.0.3904.70\r\n**OS:** Linux x86_64\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\nSet text area to a value of null/undefined and render component using SSR mode.\r\n\r\n### Expected Behavior\r\nWould expect null/undefined values to be not stringified and set as internal value.\r\n\r\n### Actual Behavior\r\nnull/undefined values appear to be stringified and set as initial value in SSR mode.\r\n\r\n### Reproduction Link\r\n<a href=\"https://codesandbox.io/s/codesandbox-nuxt-vdcv8\" target=\"_blank\">https://codesandbox.io/s/codesandbox-nuxt-vdcv8</a>\r\n\r\n### Other comments\r\nThis is limited to how Vue is interacting w/ Nuxt SSR from what I can tell, originally I thought this was a Nuxt issue but they told me it isn't and to file it here instead. (https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt.js/issues/6639)\r\n\r\nIf I wrap the v-textarea component in client-only the problem disappears, definitely a SSR issue.\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vuetify-issue-helper.
