is because the second button click emits a `transitionend` event(*) , and that event bubbles up and is eventually cached by the Vue transtition, which listens for this event in order to catch the end of the main transition.\n\na quick fix would be to stop the propagation on the button:\n\n```\n<button id=\"animated_button\" @click=\"hide\" @transitionend.stop>Transition broken</button>\n```\n\nWe ill look into weither we can fix with, I think about comparing the event's `target` and `currentTarget`\n\n---\n\n(*) why that is even though no CSS attribute of the button is really transitioning in this situation, is beyond me\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vuejs/vue/issues/comments/242025231/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"LinusBorg","id":1444526,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0NDQ1MjY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1444526?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/LinusBorg","html_url":"https://github.com/LinusBorg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LinusBorg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LinusBorg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LinusBorg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LinusBorg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LinusBorg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LinusBorg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LinusBorg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LinusBorg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LinusBorg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":765802005,"node_id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDc2NTgwMjAwNQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vuejs/vue/issues/events/765802005","actor":{"login":"LinusBorg","id":1444526,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0NDQ1MjY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1444526?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/LinusBorg","html_url":"https://github.com/LinusBorg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LinusBorg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LinusBorg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LinusBorg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LinusBorg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LinusBorg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LinusBorg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LinusBorg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LinusBorg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LinusBorg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2016-08-24T10:52:01Z","label":{"name":"bug","color":"fc2929"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vuejs/vue/issues/comments/242053195","html_url":"https://github.com/vuejs/vue/issues/3506#issuecomment-242053195","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vuejs/vue/issues/3506","id":242053195,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI0MjA1MzE5NQ==","user":{"login":"francc","id":885158,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4NTE1OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/885158?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/francc","html_url":"https://github.com/francc","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/francc/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/francc/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/francc/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/francc/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/francc/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/francc/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/francc/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/francc/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/francc/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-08-24T12:56:52Z","updated_at":"2016-08-24T12:56:52Z","body":"Adding
