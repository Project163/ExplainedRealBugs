(it's managed by the popstate event and uses vuex actions to update actively the new state)\r\n\r\n### What is expected\r\nThe checkbox should go on or off depending on the previous action or new current state.\r\n\r\n### What is actually happening?\r\nEverything get's correctly updated (value wise), except the checkbox isn't honored to update (checked true/false). It keeps in a previous state. When selecting multiple after eachother and navigating back and forward is looks like is off a beat and missing the last changed checkbox.\r\n\r\nCode that goes with it:\r\nhttps://github.com/Automotivated/vroom/blob/master/src/views/elements/filters/Multiple.vue\r\nFull github repo:\r\nhttps://github.com/Automotivated/vroom/\r\n\r\nWhile reading the [docs](https://vuex.vuejs.org/en/forms.html) in Vuex, it seems to be best practise to do it like I did. \r\n\r\n### When did it work\r\nIt worked like a charm in 2.1.6. Seems really that fixing this bug triggered this bug to be created.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vuejs/vue/issues/4704/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vuejs/vue/issues/4704/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
