this change, some work I was doing on vue-mdl now won't work. In particular, for things like md-switch which behave like <input type=\"checkbox\"> I would like the exposed properties to match what is expected, e.g.:\n\n```\n<mdl-switch v-model=\"checked\" :value=\"Blue\"></mdl-switch\n```\n\nAnd as I workaround, I was able to do the following:\n\n```\n<mdl-switch type=\"checkbox\" v-model=\"checked\" :value=\"Blue\"></mdl-switch\n```\n\nAnd get the v-model working as expected with \"checked\" on the component, not value. With the change committed, this will no longer work. By all means, if there's some _other_ solution for using v-model with a property other than \"value\", I'm all for it, but right now, there's no way with the last change.\n\nThoughts?\n\nPS: The in
