You can always alias them inside the components options.\r\n\r\nThe real scenario is, when we use a UI collection set. we simply `import` it and `use` it:\r\n```js\r\nimport SomeUI from 'some-ui'\r\nVue.use(SomeUI)\r\n```\r\nWe don't need to care about whether it's registered with kebab-case, camelCase, or TitleCase.\r\n\r\nIf we register a local component , we simply do:\r\n```html\r\n<template>\r\n  <div>\r\n    <tab-pane>something</tab-pane>\r\n  </div>\r\n</template>\r\n\r\n<script>\r\nimport TabPane from './TabPane.vue'\r\nexport default {\r\n  components: {\r\n    TabPane\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n</script>\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut what if SomeUI also has a component named 'tab-pane', and it is registered with:\r\n```js\r\nVue.component('tab-pane', {...})\r\n```\r\nThen the local registered component will never be used.\r\n\r\nWe have to use a longer syntax:\r\n```js\r\nexport default {\r\n  component: {\r\n    'tab-pane': TabPane\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd what you said overriding a thirty UI's local component with a global component is a rare case, it's like a hack.
