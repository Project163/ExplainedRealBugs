It does not work for native ES modules where the flag is not present.\r\n\r\nIf you agree, I could easy put in a PR to remove the check for `comp.__esModule` on line 15 of [resolve-async-component.js]( https://github.com/vuejs/vue/blob/0cd6ef321b3168d6c46c7a870c3d2a53fd9d4bde/src/core/vdom/helpers/resolve-async-component.js), which would solve the issue\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.
