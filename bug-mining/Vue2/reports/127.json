More details in the comments of the fiddle.\r\n\r\n### Vue.js version\r\n2.x (Tested with 2.1.3 and 2.1.4)\r\n\r\n### Reproduction Link\r\nhttp://jsfiddle.net/JosephusPaye/df4Lnuw6/78/\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\n1. Run the fiddle\r\n2. Inspect the rendered elements using devtools to see the problem described\r\n\r\n### What is Expected?\r\n`v-bind` should remove attributes whose values are falsy (`false`, `null`, `undefined`) regardless of the presence of other attributes and the `.prop` modifier.\r\n\r\n### What is actually happening?\r\nAttributes with falsy values are not removed when another attribute with the `.prop` modifier appears first. Instead, these attributes are rendered with the string `\"false\"`, `\"null\"` or `\"undefined\"` as their value.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"yyx990803","id":499550,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5OTU1MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/499550?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yyx990803","html_url":"https://github.com/yyx990803","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yyx990803/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yyx990803/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yyx990803/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yyx990803/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yyx990803/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yyx990803/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yyx990803/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yyx990803/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yyx990803/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vuejs/vue/issues/4432/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vuejs/vue/issues/4432/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
