info about this issue: it turns out that `getCurrentInstance()` is still set during `router.beforeEach()` which I don't know if it's expected.\r\nThe real problem comes from the `inject()` function

disappear.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vuejs/pinia/issues/1436/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vuejs/pinia/issues/1436/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":6976365165,"node_id":"CE_lADOALL9ps5NZ5dkzwAAAAGf0uJt","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vuejs/vue/issues/events/6976365165","actor":{"login":"yyx990803","id":499550,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5OTU1MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/499550?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yyx990803","html_url":"https://github.com/yyx990803","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yyx990803/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yyx990803/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yyx990803/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yyx990803/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yyx990803/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yyx990803/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yyx990803/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yyx990803/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yyx990803/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":"0825d3087f9f39435838329c16adc2a7bfccd51d","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vuejs/vue/commits/0825d3087f9f39435838329c16adc2a7bfccd51d","created_at":"2022-07-12T10:20:09Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vuejs/vue/issues/comments/1286661301","html_url":"https://github.com/vuejs/vue/issues/12636#issuecomment-1286661301","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vuejs/vue/issues/12636","id":1286661301,"node_id":"IC_kwDOALL9ps5MsOS1","user":{"login":"lozinsky","id":15981489,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1OTgxNDg5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15981489?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lozinsky","html_url":"https://github.com/lozinsky","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lozinsky/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lozinsky/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lozinsky/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lozinsky/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lozinsky/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lozinsky/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lozinsky/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lozinsky/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lozinsky/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2022-10-21T08:51:43Z","updated_at":"2022-10-21T08:51:43Z","body":">
