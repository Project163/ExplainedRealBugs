If you go back and forth over that threshold you can make the list flash. It flashes because it is hidden by v-show. But in the CSS i make the list vertical under 1000px. It seems that v-show is firing a too late.\r\n\r\nYou can see the comparison to 2.4.4 here https://codepen.io/ericcirone/pen/Oxoxzr\r\nOn 2.4.4 you can not get the list to flash at the larger size. \r\n\r\n### What is expected?\r\nList should be hidden at < 1000px.\r\n\r\n### What is actually happening?\r\nList flashes vertical for a split second before disappearing.\r\n\r\n---\r\nJust noticed this when updating to 2.5.1. Hopefully its a quick fix. I'm using this behavior on a menu bar and now when you make the screen smaller its very janky.\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.
