However if it's pre-ceded by a valid element, eg: a div the script is blocked from execution by the renderer. You do not have to close said element as shown in examples, simply preceding the script tag with a valid opening tag suffices. I believe this is because the renderer automatically closes elements with missing closures.\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.
