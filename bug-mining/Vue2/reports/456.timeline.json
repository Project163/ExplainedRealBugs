#10733\r\n\r\nSSR render does not execute directives attached to a component, this is happening because during SSR render we're using the component's root element as a source for rendering, thus there's no directive associated with it.\r\n\r\nThis fixes it by copying directives from the Component declaration to the Component's root element, while rendering the root element it references the Component instance vnode to properly render it's modules applying the directives.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nPlease make sure to read the Pull Request

Version\n\n[v2.12.2](https://github.com/nuxt.js/releases/tag/v2.12.2)\n\n### Reproduction link\n\n[https://github.com/Tibon4ik/nuxt-ssr-inherit-attrs](https://github.com/Tibon4ik/nuxt-ssr-inherit-attrs)\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\nClone the repo\n* $ npm install\n* $ npm run dev\n\n### What is expected ?\n\nhtml element with class \"app-card\" should not have attribute \"app-card-prop\"\n![QIP Shot - Screen 009.png](https://cmty.s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/71995937/3c4fdea0-7985-11ea-8a9b-73653e99653f.png)\n\n\n### What is actually happening?\n\nhtml element with class \"app-card\" has attribute \"app-card-prop\"\n![QIP Shot - Screen 010.png](https://cmty.s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/71995937/a6cc4e80-7985-11ea-8a9b-73653e99653f.png)\n\n\n### Additional comments?\n\nThis bug happens when i use component with inheritAttrs: false, which use another component on top level of <template> section or render function.\n\nI want to pass props to inner component with v-bind=\"$attrs\" and inheritAttrs: false. It passes props inside but still adds attributes to html element.\n\nThis issue doesn't occur in \"spa\" mode but in \"universal\" mode it exists in \"dev\" process and stay in \"build\" + \"start\" process.\n\nQuick sample:\nI have AppCard component\nhttps://monosnap.com/file/GGbNVUgCNQmzGFh46JemMxMubAcxls\nAnd i have PlayerCard component which uses AppCard component and pass props with v-bind=\"$attrs\" and inheritAttrs: false\nhttps://monosnap.com/file/paLwmTwxoiEnL4CFHSXMjaFcmJaN4B\nAnd then i use PlayerCard with prop of AppCard component\nhttps://monosnap.com/file/5Xr7JGoMeS130YqOHZzfLF2RfhFTfE\nResulting html element has \"app-card-prop\" html attribute (as in \"What is actually happening?\" section)\n\nI noticed that this bug doesn't occur in next cases:\n* if i set inheritAttrs: false on inner component (AppComponent of \"Quick sample\").\n* if top level of <template> or render function is not another component (e.g. simple \"div\" or \"span\").
