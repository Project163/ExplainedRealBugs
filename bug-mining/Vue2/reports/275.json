Create a Vue instance that has a reference to a large object in its data\r\n1. Render either a component or an element with any event handler\r\n1. Destroy the Vue instance, remove its element, null out its reference\r\n\r\n### What is expected?\r\nThe Vue instance and the references it contains should be freed for garbage collection\r\n\r\n### What is actually happening?\r\nThe `target` variables [here](https://github.com/vuejs/vue/blob/dev/src/platforms/web/runtime/modules/events.js#L29) or [here](https://github.com/vuejs/vue/blob/dev/src/core/instance/events.js#L22) hang onto references and prevent garbage collection\r\n\r\n---\r\nI have a fix ready for this and will be filing a PR shortly\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.
