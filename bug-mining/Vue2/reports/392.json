Once 'Break It' is pressed the application is not updating anything anymore. A runtime exception during render essentially killed it without any good way to handle it.\r\n\r\nWhenever a progress elements value is set to NaN, the Error `TypeError: \"Value being assigned to HTMLProgressElement.value is not a finite floating-point value.\"` is being listed in the console, but somehow instead of just handling this render error (handled by standard component error handler) the component and the entire application is permanently damaged after this.\r\n\r\nOf course the developer should foresee this and write it with the appropriate defensiveness, but runtime errors inside the render function of a component should not invisibly leave the entire application in a non-reactive state. \r\n\r\nEDIT: Updated source of console message\r\n\r\n### What is expected?\r\nHandle this as a standard render exception.\r\n\r\n### What is actually happening?\r\nVue is not reactive anymore. Eg.no button has any effect anymore.\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.
