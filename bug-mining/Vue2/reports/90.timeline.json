So I don't think it is a undeclared props issue.\n\nThere is no problem with the compiler. I print both render functions' text. They are the same.\n\nThe problem is, at runtime, every instance will have an `_update`, where 'style' module will patch the element. `sytle` module will find VNode's element and set style to it, which in this case is the `div.bug`.\n\nBut at server rendering, the render function `h('bug')` will not trigger module code, thus the bug. \n\nIt's quite hard to fix....\n\nWhat about in renderStyle, inspect the parent node, if the parent node has `componentOptions` which indicates it is a component tag, append all styles from parent\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vuejs/vue/issues/comments/257282705/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"HerringtonDarkholme","id":2883231,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4ODMyMzE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2883231?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HerringtonDarkholme","html_url":"https://github.com/HerringtonDarkholme","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HerringtonDarkholme/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HerringtonDarkholme/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HerringtonDarkholme/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HerringtonDarkholme/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HerringtonDarkholme/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HerringtonDarkholme/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HerringtonDarkholme/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HerringtonDarkholme/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HerringtonDarkholme/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":842055500,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDg0MjA1NTUwMA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vuejs/vue/issues/events/842055500","actor":{"login":"HerringtonDarkholme","id":2883231,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4ODMyMzE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2883231?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HerringtonDarkholme","html_url":"https://github.com/HerringtonDarkholme","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HerringtonDarkholme/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HerringtonDarkholme/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HerringtonDarkholme/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HerringtonDarkholme/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HerringtonDarkholme/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HerringtonDarkholme/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HerringtonDarkholme/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HerringtonDarkholme/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HerringtonDarkholme/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"b320ae3b2ada80c3927ac7d0c8a41b73450f7051","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/HerringtonDarkholme/vue/commits/b320ae3b2ada80c3927ac7d0c8a41b73450f7051","created_at":"2016-10-31T15:20:29Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"actor":{"login":"HerringtonDarkholme","id":2883231,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4ODMyMzE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2883231?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HerringtonDarkholme","html_url":"https://github.com/HerringtonDarkholme","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HerringtonDarkholme/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HerringtonDarkholme/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HerringtonDarkholme/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HerringtonDarkholme/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HerringtonDarkholme/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HerringtonDarkholme/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HerringtonDarkholme/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HerringtonDarkholme/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HerringtonDarkholme/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-10-31T15:21:38Z","updated_at":"2016-10-31T15:21:38Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vuejs/vue/issues/4076","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vuejs/vue","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vuejs/vue/issues/4076/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vuejs/vue/issues/4076/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vuejs/vue/issues/4076/events","html_url":"https://github.com/vuejs/vue/pull/4076","id":186311495,"node_id":"MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0OTE2Mjg3Njc=","number":4076,"title":"[RFC]
