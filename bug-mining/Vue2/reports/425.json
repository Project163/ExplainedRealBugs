Using `@vue/composition-api` and vue `^2.6` the watcher would be called when the `mounted` hook is finished. With vue `^2.7` the watcher of the template ref is called immediately upon instantiation, so that `vm.stateChanger` is still undefined!\r\n\r\n```ts\r\n  setup (_, { emit }) {\r\n    const infiniteLoader = ref(null)\r\n\r\n    onMounted(() => {\r\n      // prints object\r\n      console.log(infiniteLoader.value.stateChanger);\r\n    })\r\n\r\n    const unwatch = watch(infiniteLoader, (vm: any) => {\r\n      // prints undefined\r\n      console.log(vm.stateChanger);\r\n      if (!vm) return\r\n      emit('infinite', vm.stateChanger)\r\n      unwatch()\r\n    })\r\n\r\n    return {\r\n      infiniteLoader,\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is how the property gets assigned in the library component I'm using: https://github.com/PeachScript/vue-infinite-loading/blob/master/src/components/InfiniteLoading.vue#L218\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.
