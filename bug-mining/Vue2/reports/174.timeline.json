working on a proof of concept with TypeScript and [vue-class-component](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-class-component) and have an issue with `<style module>` not working.\r\n\r\nBasically the computed `$styles` property never ends up on the exported definition. This only happens when the component has no other computed properties defined. If you add a placeholder it will work:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nget $style() {\r\n  return {};\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nI believe this is just the nature of the beast with the way annotations work. Since the options are wrapped in a closure, if you don't have a reference to the computed object in there from the start then the logic in vue-loader that defines `computed[$style]` puts it in the wrong place.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure that there is a way to fix it (other than the workaround mentioned) but I figured I would put this up for discussion. I made an update to vue-class-component to define a computed object if one is not provided which works, but seems like an edge case that doesn't belong in that
