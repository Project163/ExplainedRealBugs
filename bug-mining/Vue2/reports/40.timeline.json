(https://jsfiddle.net/Linusborg/rwa5cfdm/)  or\nb) use `v-if` on the component itself (https://jsfiddle.net/Linusborg/rwa5cfdm/1/)\n\nif the popup component will have its own controls, i.e. a close button, `$emit()` an event from it and let the parent listen with `@event=\"handler\"` on the component - then the parent can change the state value.\n\nThis has several advantages:\n- the parent knows about weither or not the popup is shown\n- We don't need to use tight coupling to the child components via `$ref` in you JS code.\n- the parent stays in control of when to actually show and hide

Please carefully read the following before opening your issue.\n\n中文用户：请尽量用英文描述你的 issue，这样能够让尽可能多的人帮到你。\n\nGot a question?\n===============\nThe issue list of this repo is **exclusively** for bug reports and feature requests. For simple questions, please use the following resources:\n\n- Read the docs: http://vuejs.org/guide/\n- Watch video tutorials: https://laracasts.com/series/learning-vue-step-by-step\n- Ask in the Gitter chat room: https://gitter.im/vuejs/vue\n- Ask on the forums: http://forum.vuejs.org/\n- Look for/ask questions on stack overflow: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/ask?tags=vue.js\n\nReporting a bug?\n================\n- Try to search for your issue, it may have already been answered or even fixed in the development branch.\n\n- Check if the issue is reproducible with the latest stable version of Vue. If you are using a pre-release, please indicate the specific version you are using.\n\n- It is **required** that you clearly describe the steps necessary to reproduce the issue you are running into. Issues with no clear repro steps will not be triaged. If an issue labeled \"need repro\" receives no further input from the issue author for more than 5 days, it will be closed.\n\n- It is recommended that you make a JSFiddle/JSBin/Codepen to demonstrate your issue. You could start with [this template](http://jsfiddle.net/5sH6A/) that already includes the latest version of Vue.\n\n- For bugs that involves build setups, you can create a reproduction repository with steps in the README.\n\n- If your issue is resolved but still open, don’t hesitate to close it. In case you found a solution by yourself, it could be helpful to explain how you fixed it.\n\nHave a feature request?\n=======================\nRemove the template from below and provide thoughtful commentary *and code samples* on what this feature means for your product. What will it allow you to do that you can't do today? How will it make current work-arounds straightforward? What potential bugs and edge cases does it help to avoid? etc. Please keep it product-centric.\n-->\n\n<!-- BUG REPORT TEMPLATE -->\n### Vue.js version\n\n2.0.0-rc.3\n### Reproduction Link\n\n<!-- A minimal JSBin, JSFiddle, Codepen, or a GitHub repository that can reproduce the bug. -->\n\nhttps://jsfiddle.net/eft0d9qe/\n### Steps to reproduce\n\nClick 'Show Child' button, then 'Close', then 'Show Child' button again, then 'Close' again\n### What is Expected?\n\nThe `Child` component should be hidden for the second time.\n### What is actually happening?\n\n`TypeError: o.fn is not a function` error is throwed in the console, the `closeChild` event handler is not

Click the link \"Open popup using v-show\"\n2. A badly designed popup opens\n3. Click the \"Close\" link\n### What is Expected?\n- The popup closes successfully\n### What is actually happening?\n- Vue fails to call an internal function and throws: `TypeError: o.fn is not a function. (In 'o.fn(ev)', 'o.fn' is an instance of Object)`\n- The `closePopupUsingVShow` function attached to the \"Close\" link's click event never gets called.\n- The popup does not close.\n\nFor reference the codepen contains the exact same implementation of the popup with the only difference that it uses `v-if` instead of `v-show` to show/hide the popup. `v-if` works perfectly.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vuejs/vue/issues/3556/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vuejs/vue/issues/3556/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
