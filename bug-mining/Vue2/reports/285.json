The same thing happens with actual SSR that sets the padding based on window width. \r\n\r\n### What is expected?\r\nThe inline style should be updated when the page hydrates (see the codepen below)\r\n\r\n### What is actually happening?\r\nThe style only updates if the element has a `ref`\r\nSee https://codepen.io/anon/pen/aVyjoM?editors=1010\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.
