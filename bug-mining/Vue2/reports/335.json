Version\r\n2.5.17-beta.0\r\n\r\n### Reproduction link\r\n[https://github.com/vuejs/vue/blob/2efc0446b3ac1f18fff8b59215e7b60d51c41965/src/server/template-renderer/index.js](https://github.com/vuejs/vue/blob/2efc0446b3ac1f18fff8b59215e7b60d51c41965/src/server/template-renderer/index.js)\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\nNo need to repro, it's written in the code.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/vuejs/vue/blob/2efc0446b3ac1f18fff8b59215e7b60d51c41965/src/server/template-renderer/index.js#L107\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/vuejs/vue/blob/2efc0446b3ac1f18fff8b59215e7b60d51c41965/src/server/template-renderer/index.js#L139-L141\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/vuejs/vue/blob/2efc0446b3ac1f18fff8b59215e7b60d51c41965/src/server/template-renderer/index.js#L160\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/vuejs/vue/blob/2efc0446b3ac1f18fff8b59215e7b60d51c41965/src/server/template-renderer/index.js#L184\r\n\r\n```\r\nhref=\"${this.publicPath}/${file}\"\r\nsrc=\"${this.publicPath}/${file}\"\r\n```\r\nThe `publicPath` of `webpackConfig.output` could be empty, and it is resonable.\r\n\r\n### What is expected?\r\n- `publicPath = ''` generates `assets/css/xxx`\r\n- `publicPath = '/'` generates`/assets/css/xxx` \r\n\r\nThey are rather different\r\n\r\n### What is actually happening?\r\n- `publicPath = ''` and `publicPath = '/'` both generate `/assets/css/xxx`\r\n\r\n---\r\nSo we could introduce an extra judgement for `this.publicPath === ''`\r\n\r\nOr we could just use `publicPath` directly.\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.
