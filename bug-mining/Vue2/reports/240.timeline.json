You add some text, DOM looks like (consider that `value` is describing a domProp and not attr here)\r\n```html\r\n<input type=\"text\" domProp-value=\"asdasd\" />\r\n``` \r\nStep 3.

simply change from type `password` to type `text` when using vanilla DOM+JS, then it should be as simple in Vue too, because Vue is(should be) an extension of what people expect from vanilla DOM.\r\n\r\nHonestly this is good enough reason to make this optimization on your end, in this case and any other similar cases, to make it as intuitive as possible for end

It indeed makes sense to change the `type` only when it goes from one text-like input to another. \r\n\r\nVue was never claiming `be interoperable with outside code`. Rather then that, vue guarantees to keep in sync actual dom with virtual dom when using it's reactivity system and it's impossible to predict how it's going to do that since internal API can and will change over time. This is not a bug since it's keeping in sync the actual dom with virtual dom defined by template.
