This worked because the more specific listeners (e.g. `@input=\"$emit('input', $event.target.value)`) were called _after_ the more generic listeners with `v-on=\"$listeners`.\r\n\r\n### What is actually happening?\r\nIn 2.5.1, these higher priority listeners are now triggered first, so that if the listener sets a value, it will set the correct value, _then_ the incorrect value, breaking `v-model`.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThe breaking change was made to solve [another issue](https://github.com/vuejs/vue/issues/6805), so it's probably not ideal to just revert the change. And actually, even the previous behavior was slightly undesirable, as it emitted the same event twice.\r\n\r\nTo fix both issues, **I would actually expect the more specific event binding (e.g. `@input`) to _replace_ the listener of the same name from `v-on` with the object syntax.** The more specific listener would then take responsibility for emitting an event at the correct time. That allows the user full, explicit control over the order in which local handlers and handlers from the parent are called.\r\n\r\nHow does that sound to others?\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.
