vuetify](https://github.com/vuetifyjs/webpack-ssr) project\r\n- copy the https://codepen.io/anon/pen/rJRNrL to the welcome page\r\n- load the app on mdAndUp (> 960px)\r\n- hit F5\r\n\r\n### Expected Behavior\r\nCards should be rendered side by side (row layout).\r\n\r\n### Actual Behavior\r\nWhen hitting F5, cards are rendering one below the other (column layout) - that is the bug.\r\nWhen resize the window, cards are rendering as expected (row layout).\r\nWhen webpack compiles with the page previously opened, cards are rendering as expected (row layout).\r\n\r\n### Reproduction

Developers should not rely on extra inline styles being left untouched.\r\n\r\n**The PR fulfills these requirements:**\r\n\r\n- [x] It's submitted to the `dev` branch for v2.x (or to a previous version branch), _not_ the `master` branch\r\n- [ ] When resolving a specific issue, it's referenced in the PR's title (e.g. `fix #xxx[,#xxx]`, where \"xxx\" is the issue number)\r\n- [x] All tests are passing: https://github.com/vuejs/vue/blob/dev/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#development-setup\r\n- [x] New/updated tests are included\r\n\r\nIf adding a **new feature**, the PR's description includes:\r\n- [ ] A convincing reason for adding this feature (to avoid wasting your time, it's best to open a suggestion issue first and wait for approval before working on it)\r\n\r\n**Other information:**\r\n\r\nThere's currently a somewhat sharp gotcha with SSR where an inline style rendered for an element on the server, but not rendered on the client, will end up stuck on the element, leading to partially broken markup.\r\n\r\nThe styles may differ between the SSR DOM and the client DOM due to practices such as using the screen size as a prop value, which causes a style to be applied on the server which is not applied on the client when loaded on mobile clients. See vuetifyjs/vuetify#10163 for a real-world example of this.\r\n\r\nI tried to keep this PR concise and focused, but it's worth discussing potential side effects of this change. Ideally it would be scoped just to hydration to limit the surface area for side effects, but that wasn't as simple as limiting it to creation, so I opted for the simpler route for the PR.\r\n\r\nSome users may be relying on the current behavior (perhaps without realizing it), so this would break behavior for them. However, considering the current gotcha for otherwise sane looking code, it seems to be a reasonable trade-off to potentially break a tiny amount of code to remove a hard to debug issue which can lead to messed up markup.\r\n\r\nAn argument could be made that much as the DOM structure needing to match when hydrating, perhaps styles should also be required to match, which would avoid this issue. However, it seems like a tall order to ensure all styles are rendered identically between server and client since more style-oriented information is available on the client (screen size, device capabilities, etc). So, that seems like an overly burdensome requirement to put on developers for SSR. However, if that's preferred, this PR could be turned into issuing a warning on style-mismatch instead.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vuejs/vue/issues/10993/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vuejs/vue/issues/10993/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"actor":{"login":"reegodev","id":28622728,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4NjIyNzI4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/28622728?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/reegodev","html_url":"https://github.com/reegodev","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reegodev/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reegodev/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reegodev/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reegodev/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reegodev/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reegodev/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reegodev/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reegodev/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reegodev/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2021-07-18T09:14:24Z","updated_at":"2021-07-18T09:14:24Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nuxt/nuxt/issues/9467","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nuxt/nuxt","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nuxt/nuxt/issues/9467/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nuxt/nuxt/issues/9467/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nuxt/nuxt/issues/9467/events","html_url":"https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt/issues/9467","id":926902679,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU5MjY5MDI2Nzk=","number":9467,"title":"HTML
