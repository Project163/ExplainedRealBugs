However the fix for it only fixes the case when loading is actually async. Synchronous async loading does not call the \"forceRender\" (https://github.com/vuejs/vue/commit/2e472c5e5e559a7a4083b4164ffe0c3911ce0651#diff-293f31f6a318619ad803b971ef0724a3R64) so the contexts array is not cleared.\r\nI can try to fix it and submit a PR if needed.\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.
