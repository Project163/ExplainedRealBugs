In my example, you get an exception in the console and the page does not render\r\n\r\n### What is expected?\r\nPreferably a better error message or warning from Vue rather than an uncaught exception. \r\n\r\nOr for backwards compatibility with Vue 2.1.8, have Vue allow a component to have a computed with no getter.\r\n\r\n### What is actually happening?\r\nReceiving an console error and vue does not render anything.\r\n\r\nUncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'toString' of undefined\r\n    at new Watcher (vue.js:2417)\r\n    at initComputed (vue.js:2743)\r\n    at initState (vue.js:2652)\r\n    at VueComponent.Vue._init (vue.js:3696)\r\n    at new VueComponent (vue.js:3862)\r\n    at createComponentInstanceForVnode (vue.js:3080)\r\n    at init (vue.js:2888)\r\n    at createComponent (vue.js:4579)\r\n    at createElm (vue.js:4522)\r\n    at createChildren (vue.js:4647)\r\n\r\n---\r\nThis did not cause any exceptions in vue 2.1.8 and the component rendered and worked correctly.\r\n\r\nThis is code written by my coworker, and after upgrading vue today, this page was broken. I don't understand why it was written the way it was, and I do not think that the get is ever used, while the set is. It seems nonsensical to me to have code like this, but it exists. The problem is it took quite a while to hunt down why this was happening. \r\n\r\nI can imagine a potential scenario where a developer misspells \"get\" and receives this error without any warning why, and is similarly confused on how to fix it.\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.
