Open fiddle and type anything into the first field marked \"broken\". \r\n2. See in the console the error message \"Error in nextTick: \"TypeError: Cannot read property '_pending' of null\"\r\n3. Notice that Vue has stopped working\r\n4. Refresh the fiddle and type anything into the second field marked \"working\"\r\n5. Notice that everything works as expected\r\n\r\n### What is expected?\r\nWhen the value of the input field is \"foo\" the computed property `bar` will evaluate to true and the \"a\" span will display. \r\n\r\nWhen the user changes the value in the input field from \"foo\" to anything else, the computed property `bar` will evaluate to false and the \"b\" span (rendered using v-html) will display.\r\n\r\n### What is actually happening?\r\nInitially, the value of the input field is \"foo\" and the computed property `bar` is evaluated to true, so the \"a\" span is displaying. \r\n\r\nBut, when the user changes the value in the input field from \"foo\" to anything else, Vue crashes and this error message is displayed: Error in nextTick: \"TypeError: Cannot read property '_pending' of null\"\r\n\r\n---\r\nIt takes this very specific scenario for the error to appear. In the fiddle, I've shown that by removing the `@click=\"show = !show\"` event listener, Vue works as expected with no errors.\r\n\r\nHere are three other changes that, when made individually, result in Vue working as expected:\r\n  - removing the `<transition>` component surrounding the \"a\" span\r\n  - using `<span v-else>{{ b }}</span>` instead of `<span v-else v-html=\"b\"></span>`\r\n  - using `v-show=\"bar\"` and `v-show=\"!bar\"` instead of the `v-if=\"bar\"` and `v-else` directives\r\n\r\nFound via this question on Stack Overflow:\r\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/questions/50400131/cannot-read-property-pending-of-null-when-using-v-html-and-transition#\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.
