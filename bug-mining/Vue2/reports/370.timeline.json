Today I spent half an hour trying to figure out why my `.sync` doesn't work.\r\n\r\nThe problem is that the documentation on [Custom Events: Event Names](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/components-custom-events.html#Event-Names) states:\r\n\r\n> For these reasons, we recommend you always use kebab-case for event names.\r\n\r\nSo it's not always: more like always unless you emit event for `.sync`. You should add a note about that.\r\n\r\nAlso in the documentation [Custom Events: `.sync` modifier](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/components-custom-events.html#sync-Modifier) I would change the example to use a property with multiple word name (now it's a single word `title`, which doesn't help with this problem) and/or add a note about this event name incosistency with previous recommendation (\"always use kebab case\") on the same page.","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vuejs/vue/issues/comments/391655408/reactions","total_count":8,"+1":8,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"robertjk","id":12070821,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMDcwODIx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12070821?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertjk","html_url":"https://github.com/robertjk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertjk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertjk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertjk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertjk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertjk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertjk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertjk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertjk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertjk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vuejs/vue/issues/comments/391673076","html_url":"https://github.com/vuejs/vue/issues/6428#issuecomment-391673076","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vuejs/vue/issues/6428","id":391673076,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM5MTY3MzA3Ng==","user":{"login":"LinusBorg","id":1444526,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0NDQ1MjY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1444526?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/LinusBorg","html_url":"https://github.com/LinusBorg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LinusBorg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LinusBorg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LinusBorg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LinusBorg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LinusBorg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LinusBorg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LinusBorg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LinusBorg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LinusBorg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-05-24T10:56:54Z","updated_at":"2018-05-24T10:56:54Z","body":"Good suggestions to put in an issue in the vuejs.org repository. \r\n\r\nHere they will go unnoticed, the issue is old and closed.

guys,\r\n\r\nThis is my first contribution to Vuetify. Thank you all for your hard work doing this amazing software!\r\n\r\n#  Description\r\nAdds `update:menuListIndex` event for `v-select`/`v-autocomplete` components to inform on any menu index change (using keyboard). This is helpful for example to indicate if an item is selected or not (index `-1`).\r\n\r\n## Motivation and Context\r\n`v-autocomplete` and `v-select` does not provide a clear way to indicate if any item in the menu was selected. This event is triggered when keyboard arrows are used to change the selection.\r\nIt could help reacting on empty \"enter\" keypress.\r\n\r\nFor my case I was doing a search input with suggestions with pretty default logic:\r\n1. When you input some search query, suggestions appear. If you hit enter right away you will be redirected to full-search page.\r\n2. If you use your arrows to navigate through the elements and hit enter, the default behavior (`input`) is triggered.\r\n\r\nThere wasn't any prop or event that could indicate that the selected index is not `-1`. I wasn't able to decide which strategy should be triggered when \"enter\" was hit. With this change I can for example store the index and check it on `@keyup.enter` event.\r\n\r\n## How Has This Been Tested?\r\nI've used playground to test both the `v-autocomplete` and `v-select` for event emission.\r\nI have created one **unit test** that checks if event is fired when navigating on the suggestion items.\r\n\r\n## Markup:\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n\r\n```vue\r\n<template>\r\n  <v-container>\r\n    <v-autocomplete\r\n      ref=\"autocomplete\"\r\n      append-icon=\"\"\r\n      append-outer-icon=\"search\"\r\n      label=\"Search\"\r\n      :items=\"results\"\r\n      :no-filter=\"true\"\r\n      :return-object=\"true\"\r\n      @input=\"selected\"\r\n      @update:list-index=\"setListIndex\"\r\n      @keyup.enter=\"searchPage\"\r\n    >\r\n    </v-autocomplete>\r\n  </v-container>\r\n</template>\r\n\r\n<script>\r\n  export default {\r\n    data: () => ({\r\n      listIndex: -1,\r\n      results: [\r\n        {\r\n          name: 'Search result item 1',\r\n          text: 'result-item-1'\r\n        },\r\n        {\r\n          name: 'Search result item 2',\r\n          text: 'result-item-2',\r\n        }\r\n      ],\r\n    }),\r\n    methods: {\r\n      selected(el) {\r\n        console.log('Redirect directly to selected element', el.name)\r\n      },\r\n      searchPage() {\r\n        if (this.listIndex === -1) {\r\n          console.log('GO TO FULL SEARCH PAGE')\r\n        }\r\n        return;\r\n      },\r\n      setListIndex(index) {\r\n        this.listIndex = index;\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n</script>\r\n```\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n- [ ] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [x] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to not work as expected)\r\n- [ ] Improvement/refactoring (non-breaking change that doesn't add any feature but make things better)\r\n\r\n## Checklist:\r\n- [x] The PR title is no longer than 64 characters.\r\n- [x] The PR is submitted to the correct branch (`master` for bug fixes and documentation updates, `dev` for new features and breaking changes).\r\n- [x] My code follows the code style of this project.\r\n- [x] I've added relevant changes to the documentation (applies to new features and breaking changes in core library) \r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vuetifyjs/vuetify/issues/7828/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vuetifyjs/vuetify/issues/7828/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
