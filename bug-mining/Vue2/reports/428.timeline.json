think it's caused by https://github.com/vuejs/vue/blob/main/packages/compiler-sfc/src/compileScript.ts#L1838\r\n\r\nEvent handler like `$emit('update:a');` is recognized as a TypeScript type annotation syntax and passed to `babelParser.parseExpression`, which caused an error because it's a *statement* not an *expression*.\r\n\r\nA possible fix is #12594 , which strips the strings in the code before detecting type syntax.\r\n\r\nAnd I've found that Vue3 has the same problem. I think the fix can be ported to vuejs/core
