But some pages needs a `SearchBar` and some don't, and layouts may have different levels. \r\n\r\nSo I created a component called `LayoutDefault` as a base for other layouts to use. And because I want to be able to replace the default Toolbar when needed, I put the default Toolbar in `<slot name=\"toolbar\">`, with `Toolbar` as fallback content. \r\n\r\nCode snippet:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n// LayoutDefault.vue\r\n<slot name=\"toolbar\">\r\n  <Toolbar title=\"title from layout-inner\">\r\n    <slot name=\"toolbarSlot\"></slot>\r\n  </Toolbar>\r\n</slot>\r\n```\r\n\r\nI make these kind of components because I want to be able to:\r\n1. Replace the default Toolbar if need.\r\n2. Using the default Toolbar, but pass things to its slot (`\"toolbarSlot\"` in above example)\r\n\r\nAnd then in other layout components, I do this:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n// LayoutLv1.vue\r\n<div class=\"layout\">\r\n  <LayoutDefault>\r\n    <slot name=\"toolbar\" slot=\"toolbar\"></slot>\r\n    <slot name=\"toolbarSlot\" slot=\"toolbarSlot\"></slot>\r\n    <slot>default content from Layout</slot>\r\n  </LayoutDefault>\r\n</div>\r\n```\r\n\r\nAs you can see, to pass components to grandchild's slots, I used this pattern: `<slot name=\"foo\" slot=\"foo\">`.\r\n\r\nFor some reason, components passed using this pattern will be passed to the **default slot** if there's one.\r\n\r\nSee examples 2, 3, and 4 in the reproduction.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### What is expected?\r\nI expect when no nothing is passed to a named slot, the fallback content will be rendered, with it's slots too.\r\n\r\n\r\n### What is actually happening?\r\nIn example 2, the replaced `Toolbar` is rendered in `LayoutDefault`'s default slot.\r\n\r\nIn example 3 and 4, `SearchBar` is passed to `slot=\"toolbarSlot\"`, but not rendered.\r\n\r\n---\r\nIs this the expected behavior?\r\nOr if there's a way for me to make these kind of reusable layouts with each default parts replaceable, and if using the default parts, be able to pass components into their (default parts) slots?\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.
