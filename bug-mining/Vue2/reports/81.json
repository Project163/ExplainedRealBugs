In this application I'm having several selects where each v-model binds to an individual index of an array . This is without problems in Vue 1.x but in version 2 it does not update.  I believe this is a potential bug.\n\nI have reproduced the problem here:\nhttps://jsfiddle.net/peterkorgaard/a7vvz753/18/\n\n<!--\n中文用户请注意：\n\n1. issue 只接受带重现的 bug 报告，请不要用来提问题！不符合要求的 issue 会被直接关闭。\n2. 请尽量用英文描述你的 issue，这样能够让尽可能多的人帮到你。\n\nGot a question?\n===============\nThe issue list of this repo is **exclusively** for bug reports and feature requests.
