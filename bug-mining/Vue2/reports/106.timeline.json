The style attribute should be considered as a v-dom construct.\n\nBy comparison, consider this example. https://jsfiddle.net/gw8g8cos/4/\nThe inner text and class has been updated, the class is not merged, but style is merged.\n\nNote, this issue is different from #4205 , since lifecycle is not managed by virtual dom.\nAnd it is also different from https://github.com/vuejs/vue/issues/4216, since inline-template, speaking in implementation, has a different slot than `render` in vnode representation.\n\ncc @defcc

I'm guessing the improvement to preserve static inline styles with dynamic inline styles as per #4138 is what made this issue apparent now. I'm just wondering if this is the correct behavior. Here it's comparing the old node with the new node and then applying the necessary style changes, but the code seems to be merging them. Reusing the same node is fine; I just think it should keep only the styles for the active node that needs to be represented on the DOM.\n\nEdited the OP in light of the new info\n","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vuejs/vue/issues/comments/261203304/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"ghost","id":10137,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMTM3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10137?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost","html_url":"https://github.com/ghost","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghost/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":862516704,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50ODYyNTE2NzA0","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vuejs/vue/issues/events/862516704","actor":{"login":"LinusBorg","id":1444526,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0NDQ1MjY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1444526?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/LinusBorg","html_url":"https://github.com/LinusBorg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LinusBorg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LinusBorg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LinusBorg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LinusBorg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LinusBorg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LinusBorg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LinusBorg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LinusBorg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LinusBorg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2016-11-17T09:55:09Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
