When there's an error in a lazy-loaded component, `renderToString` is not called with an error, but instead, the error gets logged to the console and (most importantly) source-maps are not used, making the error very difficult to debug.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Repro:\r\n\r\n1. Clone the repo above and `npm install`\r\n2. `npm start`\r\n3. curl -i http://localhost:3000\r\n\r\nIf you look at the `src/entry-server.js`, you'll notice:\r\n\r\n```\r\nimport App from './App.vue';\r\n// const App = () => import('./App.vue');\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### What is expected?\r\nImporting `App` synchronously, and then running `npm start` and the curl, we see the following output:\r\n\r\n**SYNCHRONOUS:**\r\n```\r\n# STDOUT/STDERR\r\n[Vue warn]: Error in data(): \"ReferenceError: a is not defined\"\r\n\r\nfound in\r\n\r\n---> <App> at src/App.vue\r\n       <Root>\r\n\r\n# HTTP OUTPUT\r\nHTTP/1.1 500 Internal Server Error\r\nX-Powered-By: Express\r\nDate: Fri, 13 Oct 2017 13:46:55 GMT\r\nConnection: keep-alive\r\nContent-Length: 797\r\n\r\nReferenceError: a is not defined\r\n    at module.exports.__webpack_exports__.a (src/bad.js:5:0)\r\n    at module.exports.__webpack_exports__.a (src/first.js:4:0)\r\n    at VueComponent.data (src/App.vue:14:0)\r\n    at getData (node_modules/vue/dist/vue.runtime.esm.js:3301:0)\r\n    at initData (node_modules/vue/dist/vue.runtime.esm.js:3260:0)\r\n    at initState (node_modules/vue/dist/vue.runtime.esm.js:3199:0)\r\n    at VueComponent.Vue._init (node_modules/vue/dist/vue.runtime.esm.js:4437:0)\r\n    at new VueComponent (node_modules/vue/dist/vue.runtime.esm.js:4609:0)\r\n    at createComponentInstanceForVnode (/repro-vue-ssr-nomaps/node_modules/vue-server-renderer/build.js:7330:10)\r\n    at renderComponentInner (/repro-vue-ssr-nomaps/node_modules/vue-server-renderer/build.js:7515:40)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is what I expect. Notice that:\r\n  1. The status code is `500` (meaning `renderToString` was called with an `err`)\r\n  2. The stack trace uses source maps to clearly show where the error is coming from\r\n\r\n### What is actually happening?\r\nOn the other hand, importing `App` asynchronously (uncommenting `import('./App.vue')`), and then running `npm start` and the curl, we see the following output:\r\n\r\n\r\n**ASYNC:**\r\n```\r\n# STDOUT/STDERR\r\n[Vue warn]: Error in data(): \"ReferenceError: a is not defined\"\r\n\r\nfound in\r\n\r\n---> <App> at src/App.vue\r\n       <Root>\r\n[vue-server-renderer] error when rendering async component:\r\n\r\nReferenceError: a is not defined\r\n    at exports.modules.__webpack_exports__.a (0.server-bundle.js:195:3)\r\n    at exports.modules.__webpack_exports__.a (0.server-bundle.js:182:71)\r\n    at VueComponent.data (0.server-bundle.js:167:73)\r\n    at getData (server-bundle.js:3422:17)\r\n    at initData (server-bundle.js:3381:7)\r\n    at initState (server-bundle.js:3320:5)\r\n    at VueComponent.Vue._init (server-bundle.js:4558:5)\r\n    at new VueComponent (server-bundle.js:4730:12)\r\n    at createComponentInstanceForVnode (/repro-vue-ssr-nomaps/node_modules/vue-server-renderer/build.js:7330:10)\r\n    at renderComponentInner (/repro-vue-ssr-nomaps/node_modules/vue-server-renderer/build.js:7515:40)\r\n\r\n\r\n# HTTP OUTPUT\r\nHTTP/1.1 200 OK\r\nX-Powered-By: Express\r\nDate: Fri, 13 Oct 2017 13:45:41 GMT\r\nConnection: keep-alive\r\nContent-Length: 7\r\n\r\n<!---->\r\n```\r\n\r\nNotice that:\r\n  1. The status code is `200` (meaning `renderToString` was called *without* an `err`)\r\n  2. The stack trace does not use source maps and is very difficult to debug\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.
