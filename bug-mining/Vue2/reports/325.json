Set the type attribute on the input\r\n`type=\"checkbox\"` \r\n3. Have a v-model on that input.\r\n\r\n### What is expected?\r\nThe inner input still receives type=\"checkbox\"\r\n\r\n### What is actually happening?\r\nNo type attribute is inherited\r\n\r\n---\r\nWe have a custom checkbox component that provides label styling etc, and used to be able to declare the input type as well as inherit attributes from the component. Other attributes that are set on the inner input are passed correctly (ie disabled, :true-value, etc), but not the type attribute, unless you bind it. This was working prior to v2.5.14.\r\n\r\nA temporary fix we've implemented is changing `type=\"checkbox\"` to `:type=\"'checkbox'\"`, or setting v-bind=\"$attrs\" to a computed property that returns an object with Object.assign({ type: 'checkbox'}, this.$attrs);\r\n\r\nRemoving the v-model from the input also fixes it, but we use it to handle multiple checkboxes, bound to the same array\r\n\r\nHere's the same fiddle above, working in 2.5.13\r\nhttps://jsfiddle.net/linnea/onw3Lfm4/4/\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.
