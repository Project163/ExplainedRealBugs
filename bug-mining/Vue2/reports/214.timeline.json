httpVueLoader.load('app/components/component-a.vue', 'component-a'));\r\nVue.component('component-b', httpVueLoader.load('app/components/component-b.vue', 'component-b'));\r\nVue.component('component-c', httpVueLoader.load('app/components/component-c.vue', 'component-c'));`\r\n\r\nIt appears the _out-in_ transition behaves the same as the _in-out_ transition (Component B fades in before/during Component A fade out), but only on the first load of the component.  If switching between previously loaded (cached?) components, transitions behave as expected.  Please see the attached GIF demonstrating the behavior.\r\n\r\nI've been digging into the source in hopes to address this myself through a pull request, but unfortunately I'm very new to Vue and some of this is still a mystery to me.  If there's anything else I can provide, I'm happy to do so.
