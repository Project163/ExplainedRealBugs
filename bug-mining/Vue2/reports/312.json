The element's classes should not change.\r\n\r\n### What is actually happening?\r\n`v-show` triggers the enter transition every time the value changes even though the value remains truthy.\r\n\r\nThis causes the element to momentarily have the `v-enter` and `v-enter-active` classes which triggers the CSS transition very briefly. This is especially noticeable in **Safari**.\r\n\r\n---\r\n`v-show` should check if `!oldValue === !newValue` (or `Boolean(oldValue) === Boolean(newValue)`) instead of `oldValue === newValue` to see if a transition should not occur.\r\n\r\nSee [src/platforms/web/runtime/directives/show.js#L30](https://github.com/vuejs/vue/blob/f2b476d4f4f685d84b4957e6c805740597945cde/src/platforms/web/runtime/directives/show.js#L30).\r\n\r\nA workaround is to bind only boolean values to `v-show`.\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.
