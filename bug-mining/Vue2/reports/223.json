Most trivial solution is to wrap the Child template in another `<div>`, but AFAIK the `<div v-if=\"val\"></div> <div v-else></div>` construct in the root of a template is supported in Vue (there is always a single root element).\r\n\r\nOther solutions are provided in reproduction link.\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.
