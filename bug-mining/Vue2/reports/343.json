Oddly enough, there are some circumstances where it renders properly. In my use-case, I had no issues with the multiple root elements when I put the component inside a `<table>`, but when I wrapped the component with a `<tbody>` I ran into this issue I'm reporting.\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.
