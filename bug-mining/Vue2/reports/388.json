Observe the contents of the `<template>` displayed\r\n2. Change the code from `<template slot=\"content\">` to `<template #content>` or `<template v-slot:content>` and observe the contents stop being displayed\r\n3. Change the render function code from `this.$slots.content` to `this.$scopedSlots.content()` and observe the contents be displayed again\r\n\r\n### What is expected?\r\nContents are displayed all the time; old render functions don't break when used with new syntax\r\n\r\n### What is actually happening?\r\nNew syntax forces slots into being scoped, breaking existing render functions\r\n\r\n---\r\nI'm actually not sure if this is intentional or not, but it breaks Vuetify, and probably other things too. Assuming this _is_ intentional, it makes writing functional components more difficult, as you have to either:\r\n\r\n1. check both `this.$slots` (for Vue pre-2.6) and `this.$scopedSlots` (for Vue post-2.6)\r\n2. only check `this.$scopedSlots` and ask Vue pre-2.6 users to add `slot-scope` everywhere so all slots become scoped\r\n3. only check `this.$slots` and ask Vue post-2.6 users to use the legacy syntax\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.
