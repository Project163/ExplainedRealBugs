try to have different transition between my page with transtition and vue-router\n\n[here the link where i ask for help :)](http://forum.vuejs.org/topic/4942/vue-router-transition-driving-by-component-in-vue-2-0)\n\nWith vue 1.0 with your help i've got it.\nBut we try to update our kickstart to vue 2.0, and keep this logic.\n\nWe really need to get different \"complex\" transition, to be able to create some cool SPA like [noize](http://noizeoriginal.com/home) or [1700 laposte](http://1700laposte.com/jean-pierre-morin/)\nWe've done this website with vue 1.0\n\nIn our transition we need the reference to the current component, to get some data, get $router name etc... \n\nYou can see in noize, the transition is different everytime, if you go to collection from home we have one, if you leave collection detail to return to collection it's a different one.\n\nThe idea it's to let each page component create it's own transition, with that, the component can check the route, get some width, height etc....\n\nThanks again

so I found a couple of ways to make this work. One is using regular selectors at the start of the leave hook. Another is to use an object and set the refs in that object. Something like this:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<template>\r\n  <Transition\r\n    @enter=\"enterAnimationHandler\"\r\n    @leave=\"leaveAnimationHandler\"\r\n    :css=\"false\"\r\n  >\r\n    <div v-if=\"show\">\r\n      <div ref=\"elementOne\"></div>\r\n      <div ref=\"elementTwo\"></div>\r\n    </div>\r\n  </Transition>\r\n</template>\r\n```\r\n```js\r\n<script setup>\r\n  import { ref } from \"vue\";\r\n  import gsap from \"gsap\";\r\n\r\n  const elementOne = ref(null);\r\n  const elementTwo = ref(null);\r\n  const myRef = {};\r\n\r\n  const enterAnimationHandler = (_, done) => {\r\n    document.body.classList.add(\"overflow-hidden\");\r\n    myRef.elementOne = elementOne.value;\r\n    myRef.elementTwo = elementTwo.value;\r\n    gsap\r\n      .timeline({ onComplete: done  })\r\n      .to(elementOne.value, { ... }, 0)\r\n      .to(elementTwo.value, { ... }, 0.05)\r\n      .play();\r\n  };\r\n  function leaveAnimationHandler(_, done) {\r\n    gsap\r\n      .timeline({ onComplete: done  })\r\n      .to(myRef.elementOne, {...})\r\n      .to(myRef.elementTwo, {...})\r\n      .play();\r\n  }\r\n</script>\r\n```\r\nOf course the latter is not a good approach if the elements with the ref attribute are replaced. In my case they're never re-rendered, so it's safe, but if they do change, the best approach is to use a selector to traverse through the parent element inside the transition tag and look for the elements using an id or class selector.","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vuejs/vue/issues/comments/1221253439/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"rhernandog","id":4622323,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ2MjIzMjM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4622323?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rhernandog","html_url":"https://github.com/rhernandog","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rhernandog/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rhernandog/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rhernandog/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rhernandog/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rhernandog/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rhernandog/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rhernandog/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rhernandog/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rhernandog/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}}]
