See here: https://vuejs.org/v2/api/#silent – But I understand that this is probably not what you want, because it will hide ALL warnings.\r\n\r\n**However**, I would also welcome a way to exclusively turn off the warnings about the `value` attribute.\r\n\r\nMy use case is that I generate my HTML code with Python/Flask/WTForms. I only use Vue for some optional nice things, but would like to keep JavaScript as optional as possible. By using the `value` attribute, I can provide default values for *everyone*, not only people with JavaScript activated. I still provide an Object (with the same values) to Vue, so I don't need the warning.","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vuejs/vue/issues/comments/273195486/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"danieldiekmeier","id":2098462,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwOTg0NjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2098462?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/danieldiekmeier","html_url":"https://github.com/danieldiekmeier","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danieldiekmeier/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danieldiekmeier/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danieldiekmeier/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danieldiekmeier/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danieldiekmeier/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danieldiekmeier/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danieldiekmeier/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danieldiekmeier/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danieldiekmeier/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":926912049,"node_id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDkyNjkxMjA0OQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vuejs/vue/issues/events/926912049","actor":{"login":"defcc","id":2603918,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MDM5MTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2603918?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/defcc","html_url":"https://github.com/defcc","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/defcc/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/defcc/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/defcc/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/defcc/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/defcc/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/defcc/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/defcc/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/defcc/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/defcc/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2017-01-18T04:37:05Z","label":{"name":"2.x","color":"c2e0c6"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":932055124,"node_id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDkzMjA1NTEyNA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vuejs/vue/issues/events/932055124","actor":{"login":"yyx990803","id":499550,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5OTU1MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/499550?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yyx990803","html_url":"https://github.com/yyx990803","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yyx990803/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yyx990803/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yyx990803/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yyx990803/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yyx990803/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yyx990803/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yyx990803/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yyx990803/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yyx990803/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"labeled","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2017-01-22T18:01:29Z","label":{"name":"feature
