Make a `<select>` element and give it a `v-model`.\n2. Make an object in `data`, give it a property, and render that property on the page.\n3. Replace the `data` object, and you'll see (by recording and inspecting the timeline) that Vue's `setSelected` function is being called, even though the model and options for that element have not been touched.\n### What is Expected?\n\nNothing should happen. `setSelected` should not be called, since that element's model is untouched.\n### What is actually happening?\n\nIt seems that in some browsers, if _any_ object's property is being rendered to the page (`bar.name` in my fiddle), and that object is _replaced_, `setSelected` will be called, and the `<select>` will be repainted, even if its model is untouched. This causes an open `select` menu to flash. In this example I'm replacing the unrelated `data` object every second:\n\n![repaint](http://i.giphy.com/l0MYI0k4NxtTfidDq.gif)\n\nIf you just change the prop, it doesn't trigger the re-render.\n\nThis issue is present in all `rc` and `beta` versions of Vue 2.0 (for OS X Chrome).\nIt is _not_ present in Vue 1.0.26. http://jsfiddle.net/jingman/og2b6uub/1/\n","closed_by":{"login":"yyx990803","id":499550,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5OTU1MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/499550?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yyx990803","html_url":"https://github.com/yyx990803","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yyx990803/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yyx990803/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yyx990803/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yyx990803/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yyx990803/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yyx990803/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yyx990803/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yyx990803/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yyx990803/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vuejs/vue/issues/3504/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vuejs/vue/issues/3504/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
