We've found it extremely useful as the \"use strict\" of HTML, or a more aggressive \"standards compliance mode\". It eliminates historical idiosyncrasies in HTML (self-closing vs not, tag capitalization, CDATA browser quirks), it prevents certain types of XSS attacks, disallows harmful things like document.write and IE conditional comments, and fails fast on many types of errors.  The extra strictness of the XHTML syntax caught the offending line in this patch that is technically invalid HTML 5.\r\n\r\nHTML and XML syntaxes are both valid in [HTML 5.2](https://www.w3.org/TR/html52/introduction.html#html-vs-xhtml) and [WHATWG HTML](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/xhtml.html#the-xhtml-syntax) specs. XML representation of HTML5 is not deprecated, discouraged, or considered [outdated](https://github.com/vuejs/vue/issues/1036#issuecomment-120634281) by any standards body I'm aware of. [All browsers support XML formulation of HTML](http://caniuse.com/#search=xhtml) documents natively since IE 9. There's a lot of obsolete FUD about XHTML out there because few people understood the difference between content type and doctype and didn't want to serve polyglot documents for IE <=8.  There was also confusion about the relationship of XHTML 1.1 (obsolete) and 2.0 (never finalized) with \"XHTML 5\" (alive and well) that didn't help the situation.\r\n\r\nMaking content compatible with both content types and syntaxes is trivial. We've had tiny patches like this one accepted by Google, Facebook, Akamai, advertising networks, and several open source projects over the years (often after a 'why?' conversation like this one).\r\n\r\nGiven that the rest of Vue seems to be nearly 100% compatible with application/xhtml+xml documents already, we're hoping that you'll accept this patch so we don't have to maintain a fork for a backwards compatible single character change :-) If the self-closing slash really is a problem for ideological reasons, writing that code as `<div a=\"${content}\"></div>` would resolve the issue while being totally standards compliant, too.","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vuejs/vue/issues/comments/308055315/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"dvdckl","id":5014935,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwMTQ5MzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5014935?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dvdckl","html_url":"https://github.com/dvdckl","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dvdckl/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dvdckl/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dvdckl/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dvdckl/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dvdckl/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dvdckl/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dvdckl/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dvdckl/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dvdckl/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":1121123218,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MTEyMTEyMzIxOA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vuejs/vue/issues/events/1121123218","actor":{"login":"yyx990803","id":499550,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5OTU1MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/499550?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yyx990803","html_url":"https://github.com/yyx990803","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yyx990803/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yyx990803/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yyx990803/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yyx990803/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yyx990803/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yyx990803/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yyx990803/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yyx990803/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yyx990803/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":"d3a161be6c14feb7d6867458c1d1e1d4c1fe1bd6","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vuejs/vue/commits/d3a161be6c14feb7d6867458c1d1e1d4c1fe1bd6","created_at":"2017-06-13T10:48:50Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vuejs/vue/issues/comments/308079235","html_url":"https://github.com/vuejs/vue/issues/5852#issuecomment-308079235","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vuejs/vue/issues/5852","id":308079235,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMwODA3OTIzNQ==","user":{"login":"yyx990803","id":499550,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5OTU1MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/499550?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yyx990803","html_url":"https://github.com/yyx990803","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yyx990803/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yyx990803/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yyx990803/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yyx990803/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yyx990803/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yyx990803/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yyx990803/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yyx990803/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yyx990803/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-06-13T10:50:01Z","updated_at":"2017-06-13T10:50:09Z","body":"@dvdckl ha, I was a bit confused and didn't realize the fix was that simple.

won't work when using an XHTML5 container, i.e. one with structure as such:\r\n\r\n    <?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\" ?>\r\n    <!DOCTYPE html>\r\n    <html

I couldn't get a single file example to work at all, but that might be due to a bug somewhere else.  My main project which uses vue-loader and single file components had the problem that the Google Map JS files would never be requested, and an empty div would be displayed.\r\n\r\nNo errors in the JS console, or in the dev server window.  Inspecting elements showed that the div was empty.  Problem goes away when the index page is reconfigured to be regular HTML5.\r\n\r\n![2018-04-06-172042_517x129_scrot](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/883725/38432352-1b1774c6-39bf-11e8-9982-c40017ba3751.png)\r\n\r\nI think that Vue itself is supposed to work with XHTML5, for instance the response to this bug suggests that these are supported use cases: https://github.com/vuejs/vue/issues/5852\r\n\r\nHowever, in any case there's a bug that prevents the upstream Google Maps API from working in an XHTML container anyway: https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/38295566\r\nSo you should probably treat this as low priority.\r\nBut I wanted to help people who may spend a while searching for the issue with this.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/xkjyeah/vue-google-maps/issues/380/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/xkjyeah/vue-google-maps/issues/380/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
