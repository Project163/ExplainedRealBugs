Create custom directive that uses `inserted` hook\r\n2. Apply that directive to element with `v-if` and wrapped in `<transition>`\r\n3. Toggle visibility of that element\r\n\r\n\r\n### What is expected?\r\n`inserted` hook to fire (just like `bind` hook)\r\n\r\n### What is actually happening?\r\n`inserted` hook doesn't fire at all\r\n\r\n---\r\nI've spent like couple of hours debugging this on my custom directive VueBar (https://github.com/DominikSerafin/vuebar/issues/5) because I thought this was issue with my code. Unfortunately I think that's issue with Vue itself.\r\n\r\nThere is a workaround though; just wrap element with directive in another element that will get transitioned (like in 3rd example in the reproduction).\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.
