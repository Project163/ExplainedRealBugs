repo works when downgrading to vue 2.7.5. Vue 2.7.6 to 2.7.8 show this problem. I suspect it's a vue issue related to the typing information as I found similar problems in bug tracker for the latest versions. Just uninstalling the vuelidate typings package solves the problem. So it might be some type of typing conflict with vuelidate.\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.
