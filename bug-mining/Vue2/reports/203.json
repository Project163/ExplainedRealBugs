When the html is within a Vue template it removes all html tags in the script tag. I can't rewrite the whole site so I wanted to leave this part as it is. The same happens if I use v-pre which to my understanding should prevent Vue from doing anything to this part of the DOM.\r\n\r\nI guess there are good reasons for the behavior but I haven't quite figured them out yet...\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.
