fixes a double escaping of attribute values in the SSR optimizing\r\ncompiler, because literal attribute values get escaped early during the\r\ncall to `addAttr` inside `processAttrs` before it is known, if this\r\nattribute will be serialized to an _ssrNode string template.\r\n\r\nLater on the _ssrNode string template gets escaped again to preserve\r\nwhitespace and this causes double escaping of the whitespace inside the\r\nattribute value.\r\n\r\nThis approach fixes the problem by undoing the escaping by parsing the\r\nattribute value JSON in `genAttrSegment`, which is the easiest fix to\r\nthe problem, but probably not the best.\r\n\r\nThis fixes #7223 at least for the cases where I encountered the problem.\r\n\r\nSee #7223 for an in-depth description of the problem and a test-case.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nPlease make sure to read the Pull Request Guidelines:\r\nhttps://github.com/vuejs/vue/blob/dev/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request-guidelines\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<!-- PULL REQUEST
