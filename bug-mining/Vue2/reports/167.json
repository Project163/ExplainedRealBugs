Custom blocks [already do this](https://github.com/vuejs/vue/blob/dev/packages/vue-template-compiler/build.js#L5850), but the previously mentioned three don't. \r\n\r\nThis specifically applies to the [parseComponent](https://github.com/vuejs/vue/blob/dev/packages/vue-template-compiler/build.js#L5810) method. \r\n\r\nIn my use case I'm building a webpack loader to separate out component themes into a separate file.\r\n\r\nCalling parseComponent on a file that contained the following...\r\n\r\n```\r\n<style theme=\"site\" lang=\"stylus\">\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis would allow me to do `processComponent(src).output.styles[0].attrs.theme` in my tool. Without doing this I'm forced to do the parsing myself which seems unnecessary. \r\n\r\nI would use custom blocks for this, but custom blocks don't have syntax highlighting in any editor that supports *.vue files.
