I want to pass slot from the parent to a child.\r\nIn this example I have `v-modal-confirm` and `v-modal`  both can display a `title` thanks to a prop or with slot.\r\n\r\nIn the line 2 of my html demo, I use a `title` prop without slot. This slot seems to be created anyway, because the default behavior to print the title in `v-modal`  is not called.\r\n\r\n### What is expected?\r\nThe default print of the slot in the `v-modal` should be visible\r\n\r\n### What is actually happening?\r\nNothing is printed\r\n\r\n---\r\nIt works with the deprecated syntax.\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.
