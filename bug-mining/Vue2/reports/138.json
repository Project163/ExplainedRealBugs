For simple questions, please use the following resources:\r\n\r\n- Read the docs: https://vuejs.org/guide/\r\n- Watch video tutorials: https://laracasts.com/series/learning-vue-step-by-step\r\n- Ask in the Gitter chat room: https://gitter.im/vuejs/vue\r\n- Ask on the forums: http://forum.vuejs.org/\r\n- Look for/ask questions on stack overflow: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/ask?tags=vue.js\r\n\r\nReporting a bug?\r\n================\r\n- Try to search for your issue, it may have already been answered or even fixed in the development branch.\r\n\r\n- Check if the issue is reproducible with the latest stable version of Vue. If you are using a pre-release, please indicate the specific version you are using.\r\n\r\n- It is **required** that you clearly describe the steps necessary to reproduce the issue you are running into. Issues with no clear repro steps will not be triaged. If an issue labeled \"need repro\" receives no further input from the issue author for more than 5 days, it will be closed.\r\n\r\n- It is recommended that you make a JSFiddle/JSBin/Codepen to demonstrate your issue. You could start with [this template](http://jsfiddle.net/5sH6A/) that already includes the latest version of Vue.\r\n\r\n- For bugs that involves build setups, you can create a reproduction repository with steps in the README.\r\n\r\n- If your issue is resolved but still open, don’t hesitate to close it. In case you found a solution by yourself, it could be helpful to explain how you fixed it.\r\n\r\nHave a feature request?\r\n=======================\r\nRemove the template from below and provide thoughtful commentary *and code samples* on what this feature means for your product. What will it allow you to do that you can't do today? How will it make current work-arounds straightforward? What potential bugs and edge cases does it help to avoid? etc. Please keep it product-centric.\r\n-->\r\nI'm trying to make a custom list component using a scoped slot like the one in the docs, and I would like to expose all of the item properties as props to the template. Unfortunately, the `v-bind=\"obj\"` syntax doesn't seem to be working for me in a scoped slot. Is this deliberate?\r\n\r\nRegular `v-bind:prop=\"obj.prop\"` syntax is working correctly, but it would be great if I could expose everything at once.\r\n\r\nI don't believe I'm making a mistake, but sincere apologies if I am, or if this has been mentioned somewhere else that I missed.\r\n\r\nThank you!\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nEntry point:\r\n```vue\r\n<custom-list :items=\"listItems\">\r\n\t<template scope=\"item\">\r\n\t\t<li>{{ item }}</li>\r\n\t</template>\r\n</custom-list>\r\n```\r\n\r\nCustomList with implicit v-bind object binding:\r\n```vue\r\n<template>\r\n\t<ul>\r\n\t\t<slot v-for=\"item of items\" v-bind=\"item\"></slot>\r\n\t</ul>\r\n</template>\r\n```\r\n\r\nResult:\r\n\r\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/3939997/21364773/cddea38a-c6b7-11e6-8bed-b27cc7db6cf1.png)\r\n\r\n\r\nCustomList with explicit prop binding:\r\n```vue\r\n<template>\r\n\t<ul>\r\n\t\t<slot v-for=\"item of items\" :id=\"item.id\"></slot>\r\n\t</ul>\r\n</template>\r\n```\r\n\r\nResult: \r\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/3939997/21364761/c2423a78-c6b7-11e6-847c-3bfa737f0a73.png)\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"yyx990803","id":499550,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5OTU1MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/499550?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yyx990803","html_url":"https://github.com/yyx990803","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yyx990803/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yyx990803/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yyx990803/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yyx990803/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yyx990803/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yyx990803/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yyx990803/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yyx990803/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yyx990803/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vuejs/vue/issues/4529/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vuejs/vue/issues/4529/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
