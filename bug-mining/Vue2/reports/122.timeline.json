The value is applied BEFORE the type is changed to radio and therefore IE9 does not get the correct value on the newly created element which defaults to \"on\".\r\n\r\nI hope you can follow my explanations.\r\n\r\nKind regards\r\nAndreas","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vuejs/vue/issues/comments/265022516/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"adoerler","id":376589,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3NjU4OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/376589?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/adoerler","html_url":"https://github.com/adoerler","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adoerler/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adoerler/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adoerler/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adoerler/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adoerler/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adoerler/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adoerler/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adoerler/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adoerler/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":887177146,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50ODg3MTc3MTQ2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vuejs/vue/issues/events/887177146","actor":{"login":"yyx990803","id":499550,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5OTU1MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/499550?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yyx990803","html_url":"https://github.com/yyx990803","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yyx990803/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yyx990803/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yyx990803/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yyx990803/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yyx990803/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yyx990803/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yyx990803/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yyx990803/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yyx990803/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":"b48c45eb7ea8d6bdf1ec805fb4ade0576670e59a","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vuejs/vue/commits/b48c45eb7ea8d6bdf1ec805fb4ade0576670e59a","created_at":"2016-12-08T17:12:16Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
