If I revert, it runs fine.\r\n\r\nI trimmed the issue down to `vue-template-compiler`.\r\n\r\nIf I manually **switch back vue-template-compiler folder to version 2.0.3** inside node_modules, and run with everything else exactly the same (VueJS 2.0.4), nothing else changed, it gives me that warning error message telling me to \"bump to latest\"; but if I go further and force it to run with mismatching versions (by changing [this line from vue-template-compiler](https://github.com/vuejs/vue/blob/ae93d2bef8e20402ae3501aa5cdcf14b0ee19c12/packages/vue-template-compiler/index.js#L7) to `if (false) {`), then the build completes.\r\n\r\nIn short: there is an issue at `vue-template-compiler` 2.0.4 freezing the compilation of some template in my project.\r\n\r\nNote: I didn't try to run the compiled result. I believe result is unpredictable. The fact is: same codebase compiles fine with vue-template-compiler 2.0.3, but the build process freezes with vue-template-compiler 2.0.4\r\n\r\nI will try to get more info and eventually something to reproduce.\r\n\r\nThank you.","closed_by":{"login":"yyx990803","id":499550,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5OTU1MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/499550?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yyx990803","html_url":"https://github.com/yyx990803","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yyx990803/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yyx990803/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yyx990803/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yyx990803/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yyx990803/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yyx990803/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yyx990803/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yyx990803/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yyx990803/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vuejs/vue/issues/4127/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vuejs/vue/issues/4127/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
