That means, if we use vue-hot-reload-api or vue-loader, they inject some options into component options object after creating component constructors, then the component is instantiated by using constructor with $createElement and the injected options are dropped in [resolveComponentOptions function](https://github.com/vuejs/vue/blob/dev/src/core/instance/init.js#L69). \r\n\r\nAnd that it is also causing https://github.com/vuejs/vue-class-component/issues/66\r\n\r\nHere is the minimal reproduction of this bug by @ktsn \r\nhttps://jsfiddle.net/vvxLyLvq/2/\r\n\r\nI don't know much about it, I'm just creating the issue here for @ktsn \r\n\r\nIn summary this issue is causing `vue-class-component` hot-reload to not work and also makes using `vue-class-component` with `CSS Modules` impossible.\r\n\r\nThank you!","closed_by":{"login":"yyx990803","id":499550,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5OTU1MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/499550?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yyx990803","html_url":"https://github.com/yyx990803","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yyx990803/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yyx990803/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yyx990803/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yyx990803/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yyx990803/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yyx990803/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yyx990803/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yyx990803/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yyx990803/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vuejs/vue/issues/4976/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vuejs/vue/issues/4976/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
