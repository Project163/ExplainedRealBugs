Instead, `contextmenu` and `auxclick` are fired respectively.\r\n\r\nThis can be confusing so I've implemented a normalization in the compiler that transforms `click.right` and `click.middle` to the respective equivalents. Unfortunately, `auxclick` is not supported universally, so we have to use `mouseup` instead, this is not perfect since it would fire even if the click did not start on the element, but it's close enough and a dragged-middle-click seems an extremely rare operation.","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vuejs/vue/issues/comments/344002024/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"yyx990803","id":499550,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5OTU1MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/499550?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yyx990803","html_url":"https://github.com/yyx990803","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yyx990803/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yyx990803/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yyx990803/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yyx990803/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yyx990803/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yyx990803/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yyx990803/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yyx990803/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yyx990803/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":1339254518,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MTMzOTI1NDUxOA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vuejs/vue/issues/events/1339254518","actor":{"login":"yyx990803","id":499550,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5OTU1MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/499550?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yyx990803","html_url":"https://github.com/yyx990803","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yyx990803/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yyx990803/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yyx990803/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yyx990803/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yyx990803/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yyx990803/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yyx990803/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yyx990803/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yyx990803/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":"daed1e73557d57df244ad8d46c9afff7208c9a2d","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vuejs/vue/commits/daed1e73557d57df244ad8d46c9afff7208c9a2d","created_at":"2017-11-13T17:56:17Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":1452168150,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDE0NTIxNjgxNTA=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vuejs/vue/issues/events/1452168150","actor":{"login":"lovelope","id":17878623,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3ODc4NjIz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17878623?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lovelope","html_url":"https://github.com/lovelope","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lovelope/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lovelope/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lovelope/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lovelope/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lovelope/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lovelope/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lovelope/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lovelope/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lovelope/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"22d9fa56a17330b1256f0f837d694dc2db480ca0","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/lovelope/vue/commits/22d9fa56a17330b1256f0f837d694dc2db480ca0","created_at":"2018-02-01T03:38:18Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"actor":{"login":"paulgv","id":4895885,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4OTU4ODU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4895885?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulgv","html_url":"https://github.com/paulgv","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulgv/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulgv/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulgv/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulgv/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulgv/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulgv/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulgv/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulgv/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulgv/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-08-12T14:48:20Z","updated_at":"2018-08-12T14:48:20Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/nuxt/nuxt/issues/3

Version\r\n2.6.11\r\n\r\n### Reproduction link\r\n[https://codepen.io/feliperuiz/pen/MWJQPaR?editors=1011](https://codepen.io/feliperuiz/pen/MWJQPaR?editors=1011)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\nReproducing this bug requires:\r\n* a mouse with a clickable scroll wheel\r\n* opening the repro link with desktop safari or firefox<68\r\n\r\nWith that said, steps to reproduce are:\r\n* click the \"click me\" text with the primary button of your mouse\r\n* check the console output\r\n* click the \"click me\" text with the middle button of your mouse\r\n* check the console output\r\n\r\n\r\n### What is expected?\r\nThere should be a single entry in the console, for the click performed with the primary button — with text `\"You clicked something with mouse button 0\"`.\r\n\r\n### What is actually happening?\r\nThere are two entries in the console, one for the click performed with the primary button — with text `\"You clicked something with mouse button 0\"` — and another for the middle button — with text `\"You clicked something with mouse button 1\"`.\r\n\r\n---\r\n[The UI events specs](https://w3c.github.io/uievents/#event-type-click) state that:\r\n> The `click` event should only be fired for the primary pointer button (i.e., when `button` value is 0, `buttons` value is 1). Secondary buttons (like the middle or right button on a standard mouse) MUST NOT fire `click` events. See `auxclick` for a corresponding event that is associated with the non-primary buttons.\r\n\r\nSafari, however, does not care about what the specs say and fires the `click` event for secondary buttons, as evidenced by [this bug](https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=22382). Until version 68, Firefox would do the same, as noted in [this bug report](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1379466) and [the release notes for that version](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Firefox/Releases/68#DOM_events).\r\n\r\nI found these two issues [[1](https://github.com/vuejs/vue/issues/5330), [2](https://github.com/vuejs/vue/issues/7020)] on the Vue repo that relate to it, but they're more about normalizing behavior so that `@click.middle` and `@click.right` behave more as one would expect them to, rather than normalizing behavior to account for browser quirks that cause `@click` to behave as one wouldn't expect it to.\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.
