Open https://codesandbox.io/s/239l9qnkxn\r\n2. Immediately (before the async component is resolved within 7 sec) click on the \"Some Page\" link\r\n3. Click on the \"Home\" link (before 7s are elapsed)\r\n\r\n### What is expected?\r\nThe AsyncReady component should render after 7 seconds.\r\n\r\n### What is actually happening?\r\nThe AsyncLoading component is shown forever\r\n\r\n---\r\nThe problem is that the `currentRenderingInstance` is `Home`. After rendering the `SomePage` route, the initial `Home` instance (which is stored as the `owner` of the factory) is destroyed. As soon as the factory calls `forceRender`, triggering `$forceUpdate()` on the owner does nothing because the old `Home` instance already was destroyed and a new one was created when navigating back to `Home`.\r\n\r\nThis is problematic on very slow connections when users click a link before all dynamic components were resolved or in case of automatic redirects which are triggered immediately after a page is loaded (after checking auth for example).\r\n\r\nSee: https://github.com/vuejs/vue/blob/dev/src/core/vdom/helpers/resolve-async-component.js#L58-L74\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.
