The pen consists of a simple Vue instance mounted to `#app` containing a video element with `muted=\"muted\"`. \r\n2. Open the pen in Chrome and notice that the volume icon is set to muted and the video is muted when played.\r\n3. Open the pen in Firefox and notice that the volume icon is set to unmuted and the video is unmuted when played.\r\n\r\n### What is expected?\r\nThat the video plays muted and controls show muted.\r\n\r\n### What is actually happening?\r\nThe video plays unmuted and the controls show unmuted. This is especially an issue with autoplaying videos.\r\n\r\n---\r\nReproduced in Firefox 56.0 and FirefoxDeveloperEdition 57.0b10 on different machines running either macOS Sierra or High Sierra.\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.
