Create a component\r\n2.) specify a foreignObject as the first tag in the component\r\n3.) Look for errors in console output\r\n\r\n### What is Expected?\r\nIt should recognize that it's a valid tag and carry on\r\n\r\n### What is actually happening?\r\nIf you look at the code pen above you'll notice that vue is looking for a component called foreignObject but not finding one and gives a warning about that. Interestingly, with the inline template it still seems to work.\r\n\r\nI was messing around with this in a single file component and it wasn't rendering. Same error spit out in the console as before. I noticed that it was making `foreignObject` all lowercase... same for the `requiredFeatures` attribute. Otherwise I suspect it would work despite the warning. \r\n\r\n```pug\r\n  //- g.HTMLNode\r\n  foreignObject(\r\n    requiredFeatures=\"http://www.w3.org/TR/SVG11/feature#Extensibility\"\r\n    width=\"100\"\r\n    height=\"100\"\r\n  )\r\n    body(xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\")\r\n      p hello world!\r\n</template>\r\n```\r\n\r\nHere's the DOM output:\r\n\r\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/3087225/22413525/b14533d0-e686-11e6-8348-343b669a30eb.png)\r\n\r\nInterestingly if I uncomment the `g` tag in front of the `foreignObject` tag it works. \r\n","closed_by":{"login":"yyx990803","id":499550,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5OTU1MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/499550?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yyx990803","html_url":"https://github.com/yyx990803","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yyx990803/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yyx990803/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yyx990803/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yyx990803/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yyx990803/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yyx990803/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yyx990803/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yyx990803/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yyx990803/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vuejs/vue/issues/4813/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vuejs/vue/issues/4813/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
