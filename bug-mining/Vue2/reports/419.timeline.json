@posva , thanks a lot for your comment! \r\n\r\nAs suggested, I have also tried to use `v-slot` nested inside a `template` tag, something like the below. \r\n```html\r\n<div is=\"test-component\">\r\n  <template v-slot:default=\"slotProps\">\r\n    slotProps: {{slotProps.test}}\r\n  </template>\r\n</div>\r\n```\r\nHowever that produces a warning as well, see fiddle: \r\nhttps://jsfiddle.net/mybeta/bhcoLwu3/\r\n\r\nWhen avoiding the DOM template parsing caveats, it works just fine: \r\n```html\r\n<test-component>\r\n  <template v-slot:default=\"slotProps\">\r\n    slotProps: {{slotProps.test}}\r\n  </template>\r\n</test-component>\r\n```\r\nbut I believe I need to use the caveat, when using the component on a `tr` tag. \r\n\r\nAlso, would you mind explaining

LOL\r\n\r\n---\r\n## Additional Comments\r\n\r\nThere's an inconsistency in the old and new slot syntax.\r\n\r\nThe new syntax caused warning when used with the special `is` attribute. \r\nBoth the HTML below are server rendered by a CMS and is compiled by Vue compiler.\r\n```html\r\n<table>\r\n  <tr is=\"my-tr\">\r\n    <template v-slot:default>\r\n      <td>Test</td>\r\n    </template>\r\n\r\n    <template v-slot:named>\r\n      <td>Test</td>\r\n    </template>\r\n  </tr>\r\n</table>\r\n```\r\nError message:\r\n```\r\n<template v-slot> can only appear at the root level inside the receiving the component\r\n\r\n217|  <table>\r\n218|    <tbody><tr is=\"my-tr\">\r\n219|      <template v-slot:default=\"\">\r\n   |      ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\r\n220|        <td>Test</td>\r\n   |  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\r\n221|      </template>\r\n   |  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nThe old syntax works without error. 👍\r\n```html\r\n<table>\r\n  <tr is=\"my-tr\">\r\n    <template slot=\"default\">\r\n      <td>Test</td>\r\n    </template>\r\n\r\n    <template slot=\"named\">\r\n      <td>Test</td>\r\n    </template>\r\n  </tr>\r\n</table>\r\n```\r\nCan we treat `is` attributed DOM element as vue components like how the old slot syntax works?\r\n\r\nI'd like to point out that the default slot works without errors. But ideally we should be able to use named slots here as well.\r\n```html\r\n<table>\r\n  <tr is=\"my-tr\">\r\n    <td>Test</td>\r\n  </tr>\r\n</table>\r\n```\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.
