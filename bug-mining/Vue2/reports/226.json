The longhand works when the model prop is named something other than `value`.\r\n\r\n### What is expected?\r\n`v-model` should automatically wire up the `value` prop with its expression.\r\n\r\n### What is actually happening?\r\nNo value is being passed to the `value` prop. I'm getting the default value `undefined`, instead.\r\n\r\n---\r\nMy only guess is that `v-model` is binding before the component is mounted.\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.
