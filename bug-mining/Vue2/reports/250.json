SSR renders `v-html: <span>null</span>` while it changes into `<span></span>` on client side. Seems `<span v-html=\"foo\">` is being optimized into `'<span>' + (_vm.foo)`. So we can change it into `(_vm.foo|| '')` to handle this inconsistency during SSR render.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.
