Basically commenting [this line](https://github.com/vuejs/vue/blob/dev/src/platforms/web/server/modules/dom-props.js#L27) solves the problem.\r\n\r\nAnother option is evaluating `innerHTML` before comparing DOM snapshots so you get value from `innerHTML` on static SSR-rendered website without DOM Mismatch.\r\n\r\nThird option is ignoring children in `createElment` if there is `innerHTML` domProp. I think this one is the best.\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.
