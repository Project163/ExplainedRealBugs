But this is a different case.\r\nThe element itself is not manipulated in any way outside of Vue except for relocation. Vue still handles it 100% and from my analysis there is no side-effect. Vue component is still mapped to its element, except the element is in a different location. Virtual DOM works as expected and it really does not care about mapped element location and only about the actual DOM changes within, which is great.\r\n\r\nLet me write an actual use case and the value the proposed change brings us to the table. Writing a tooltip component. You still want to control it from within the context of the element/component you bind it to, but you don't want the actual tooltip content inheriting CSS from parent (imagine complex CSS affecting Tooltip in unexpected ways -- talking from a framework owner perspective). Same for Popovers. There are alternatives to relocating element position for Tooltips/Popovers, but the overhead/boilerplate necessary in app space is just too much. I have some other use cases if necessary to make my case stronger. This is just the starting point.\r\n\r\nAlso, I think the added overhead of that additional \"if\" statement is negligible. Are there some ready-to-run benchmarks I can use to compute the difference?\r\n\r\nThanks.","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vuejs/vue/issues/comments/290351747/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"rstoenescu","id":4665641,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ2NjU2NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4665641?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rstoenescu","html_url":"https://github.com/rstoenescu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rstoenescu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rstoenescu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rstoenescu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rstoenescu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rstoenescu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rstoenescu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rstoenescu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rstoenescu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rstoenescu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vuejs/vue/issues/comments/290751549","html_url":"https://github.com/vuejs/vue/issues/5321#issuecomment-290751549","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vuejs/vue/issues/5321","id":290751549,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI5MDc1MTU0OQ==","user":{"login":"posva","id":664177,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2NDE3Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/664177?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/posva","html_url":"https://github.com/posva","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/posva/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/posva/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/posva/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/posva/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/posva/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/posva/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/posva/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/posva/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/posva/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-03-31T15:52:46Z","updated_at":"2017-03-31T15:52:46Z","body":"No, I don't think there's an impact 🙂 \r\nLooks like an interesting example.
