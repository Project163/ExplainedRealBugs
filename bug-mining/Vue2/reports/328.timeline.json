saw this updated. Do you guys really think it is a good idea that resolving this by just simply revising the wording of the API docs? I don't think so.\r\n\r\nFirst of all, `render` is never the exactly same meaning as `patch` when no target following `render` term, i.e. `render` to the DOM, especially when Vue is using virtual DOM. People coming from React background will always consider `render` as running the `render()` function, by using your terms, as generating virtual DOM nodes. Of course, unless Vue wants to be very unique on this one...\r\n\r\nSecondly, if do decide to take the path that updating the docs to match the current `beforeUpdate()` behavior, not only the API description needs to be revised, but also the lifecycle diagram ([link](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/instance.html#Lifecycle-Diagram)). Since these two places consistently indicate `beforeUpdate()` should not be like current behavior, I don't believe it was deliberately designed that `beforeUpdate()` is called after `render()`, hence it is a functional bug instead of documentary.\r\n\r\nFurther more, if it is not allowed to change/update the states of the component in `beforeUpdate` without triggering additional `re-render`, this lifecycle hook is much less useful from developers point of view, because it is a very common case, for developers not matter coming from React or Angular, that updating states of components per changes to props. You know, the `render()` is called in various cases, like its own state changed, props changed, or even the parent forcing update. In React, it has a few similar but separate hooks to allow developers to detect those changes and even update states **BEFORE** calling `render()` ([link](https://reactjs.org/docs/react-component.html#componentwillupdate)).

But just because the doc and diagram indicate it allows, and I tried then found it led to infinite loop, the calling order matters. By the way, I also tried changing some states at the very beginning of `render` (I know it was wrong operation) to see if it can circumvent the situation, it turned out infinite loop too, so not only does calling order matter, but also ticks. Given I never read Vue source code, correct me here if wrong.\r\n\r\n> So changing state should be your use case.\r\n\r\nI don't think changing state before `render` running is only my use case. React against doing that in `componentWillUpdate`, while still provides `componentWillReceiveProps` to allow such operation, because developers need this. So yes, if you think `beforeUpdate` should keep current behavior, it would be better to have a new lifecycle hook like `componentWillReceiveProps`.\r\n\r\n> Other than the request, you can use watch to perform state change, for now.\r\n\r\nActually, I was curious why I couldn't find any filed bugs regarding `beforeUpdate` weird behavior before I filed, then I guessed, just as you mentioned here, people could use `watch` to achieve the goal in most of cases. However, think about when the component will be re-rendered, it is not just when `props` changed, it could also be when the parent is forcing to update even if `props` are not changed at all. Then the `watch` approach is not sufficient. In addition, one uncommon case, what if there are many `props`, say 30, and I just want to do some state changes no matter which prop has been changed. In the way of `watch`, I have to specify all 30 props to be watched explicitly...\r\n\r\nAnyway, if you think this is not a functional bug, it would be good to have a `componentWillReceiveProps`-like lifecycle.\r\n\r\nThanks again for you guys awesome

Say, \r\n\r\n```ts\r\nfunction dynamicWatch(props, vm, func) { \r\n  for (let key in props) \r\n     vm.$watch(key, func)\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo to summarize the discussion above, can we list these 3 points?\r\n1) whether `beforeUpdate` allow state change\r\n2) should `beforeUpdate` be call before `render`. \r\n3) should Vue provide a `propsUpdate` helper\r\n\r\nDoes this wrap up the thread?","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vuejs/vue/issues/comments/359724829/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"HerringtonDarkholme","id":2883231,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4ODMyMzE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2883231?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HerringtonDarkholme","html_url":"https://github.com/HerringtonDarkholme","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HerringtonDarkholme/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HerringtonDarkholme/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HerringtonDarkholme/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HerringtonDarkholme/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HerringtonDarkholme/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HerringtonDarkholme/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HerringtonDarkholme/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HerringtonDarkholme/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HerringtonDarkholme/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vuejs/vue/issues/comments/360047909","html_url":"https://github.com/vuejs/vue/issues/7481#issuecomment-360047909","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vuejs/vue/issues/7481","id":360047909,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM2MDA0NzkwOQ==","user":{"login":"nobelhuang","id":882936,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4MjkzNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/882936?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nobelhuang","html_url":"https://github.com/nobelhuang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nobelhuang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nobelhuang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nobelhuang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nobelhuang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nobelhuang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nobelhuang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nobelhuang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nobelhuang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nobelhuang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-01-24T07:47:55Z","updated_at":"2018-01-24T07:47:55Z","body":"Okay, it seems that I have to provide a couple of examples. I came up with these examples randomly.\r\n\r\n**Example 1.** [jsfiddle](https://jsfiddle.net/om9r29aj/1/)\r\nImagine a Timer, initially you can set years, months, days, hours, minutes and seconds respectively to count down, these values can also be changed anytime when you want to start a new timer. However, before a new timer starts counting down, there would be a short pause, and there is a signal above the countdown to indicate if it is currently paused or counting down. As you can see, whenever and no matter which time props of Timer is changed, we need to update some states, like `pauseHandle`, `countDownHandle` and `startpoint`, and this could be done easily and efficiently in `beforeUpdate` if state changing is allowed. Of course, we can achieve the same result by using `dynamicWatch`, but the `func` might be invoked 6 times if all time props change at once.\r\n\r\n**Example 2.** [jsfiddle](https://jsfiddle.net/j0t173qw/1/)\r\nImagine a jigsaw puzzle game, we have a board component that can host all puzzle pieces. As pieces are added to the board, the board could show different background color as hint for the player indicating if he/she is approaching the goal. As you can see, there is actually no `props` changes that can be detected for `TheBoard` component, its state change is based the `$slots.default` which is not reactive, and it is the parent that is forcing `TheBoard` to re-rendered. It is convenient to update this state in `beforeUpdate`. Of course, I know we can use a method to work out that value replacing the use of `boardColor`, but if `boardColor` will be used many times in the template, that method would be called many times in one render process, in that case, I know we can write `render` function to alleviate, but don't you think it will be easier to do that in `beforeUpdate`?\r\n\r\nI am feeling I lost my point through this thread. To wrap up, I only want to state that, because both the API doc and the lifecycle diagram consistently indicate you can change states in `beforeUpdate`, I don't think it was initially designed not to allow to do so, hence I think it's a functional bug.","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vuejs/vue/issues/comments/360047909/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"nobelhuang","id":882936,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4MjkzNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/882936?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nobelhuang","html_url":"https://github.com/nobelhuang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nobelhuang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nobelhuang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nobelhuang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nobelhuang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nobelhuang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nobelhuang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nobelhuang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nobelhuang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nobelhuang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":1448857476,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDE0NDg4NTc0NzY=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vuejs/vue/issues/events/1448857476","actor":{"login":"Jinjiang","id":206848,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwNjg0OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/206848?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jinjiang","html_url":"https://github.com/Jinjiang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jinjiang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jinjiang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jinjiang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jinjiang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jinjiang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jinjiang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jinjiang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jinjiang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jinjiang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"af9154bf9d8fdd8f25e85d6d1ef862cd58d69957","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vuejs/v2.cn.vuejs.org/commits/af9154bf9d8fdd8f25e85d6d1ef862cd58d69957","created_at":"2018-01-30T15:56:27Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":1451452777,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDE0NTE0NTI3Nzc=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vuejs/vue/issues/events/1451452777","actor":{"login":"sdras","id":2281088,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyODEwODg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2281088?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sdras","html_url":"https://github.com/sdras","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sdras/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sdras/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sdras/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sdras/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sdras/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sdras/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sdras/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sdras/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sdras/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"813ab53a9c73066f77d8a195b95eee992dfd9f20","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vuejs/v2.vuejs.org/commits/813ab53a9c73066f77d8a195b95eee992dfd9f20","created_at":"2018-01-31T19:04:32Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":1451465235,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDE0NTE0NjUyMzU=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vuejs/vue/issues/events/1451465235","actor":{"login":"vuejs-jp-bot","id":31909778,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxOTA5Nzc4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/31909778?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vuejs-jp-bot","html_url":"https://github.com/vuejs-jp-bot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vuejs-jp-bot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vuejs-jp-bot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vuejs-jp-bot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vuejs-jp-bot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vuejs-jp-bot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vuejs-jp-bot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vuejs-jp-bot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vuejs-jp-bot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vuejs-jp-bot/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site
