For simple questions, please use the following resources:\r\n\r\n- Read the docs: https://vuejs.org/guide/\r\n- Watch video tutorials: https://laracasts.com/series/learning-vue-step-by-step\r\n- Ask in the Gitter chat room: https://gitter.im/vuejs/vue\r\n- Ask on the forums: http://forum.vuejs.org/\r\n- Look for/ask questions on stack overflow: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/ask?tags=vue.js\r\n\r\nReporting a bug?\r\n================\r\n- Try to search for your issue, it may have already been answered or even fixed in the development branch.\r\n\r\n- Check if the issue is reproducible with the latest stable version of Vue. If you are using a pre-release, please indicate the specific version you are using.\r\n\r\n- It is **required** that you clearly describe the steps necessary to reproduce the issue you are running into. Issues with no clear repro steps will not be triaged. If an issue labeled \"need repro\" receives no further input from the issue author for more than 5 days, it will be closed.\r\n\r\n- It is recommended that you make a JSFiddle/JSBin/Codepen to demonstrate your issue.

What potential bugs and edge cases does it help to avoid? etc. Please keep it product-centric.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nHi everyone, i am upgrading a website to Vue 2.x. But i got into an issue and one question/feature request.\r\n\r\nThe website im trying to upgrade is: http://foostudio.mx/\r\n\r\nThe transitions works as follow: each component has its own transition that reacts to the next route. The router is using the keep alive directive, so unnecessary rendering is ommitted. \r\n\r\nBut i been having trouble doing this on Vue 2.x. \r\n\r\n<!-- BUG REPORT TEMPLATE -->\r\n### Vue.js version\r\n2.1.3\r\n\r\n### Reproduction Link\r\n<!-- A minimal JSBin, JSFiddle, Codepen, or a GitHub repository that can reproduce the bug. -->\r\nhttp://jsfiddle.net/Mendieta/j8fLau99/\r\n<!-- You could start with this template: http://jsfiddle.net/df4Lnuw6/ -->\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\nNavigate between the router links.\r\n\r\n### What is Expected?\r\nI was expecting to get the same results as on Vue 1.x, where the components animated using Js hooks with keep alive where render properly. Or maybe I am doing something wrong?\r\n\r\nVue 1.x version: http://jsfiddle.net/Mendieta/fb215702/\r\n\r\n### What is actually happening?\r\nThe components animated using js hooks are only animated once \r\n\r\n\r\nOn a side note, is it possible to use transition-mode in the above example on Vue 2.X? On 1.X it was as easy as adding the directive to the router-view. \r\n\r\nthanks","closed_by":{"login":"yyx990803","id":499550,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5OTU1MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/499550?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yyx990803","html_url":"https://github.com/yyx990803","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yyx990803/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yyx990803/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yyx990803/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yyx990803/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yyx990803/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yyx990803/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yyx990803/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yyx990803/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yyx990803/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vuejs/vue/issues/4339/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vuejs/vue/issues/4339/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
