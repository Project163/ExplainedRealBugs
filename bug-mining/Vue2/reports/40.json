Click the link \"Open popup using v-if\"\n2. A badly designed popup opens\n3. Click the \"Close\" link\n4. For this first time the popup closes successfully\n5. Click the link \"Open popup using v-if\" again\n6. The popup opens again\n7. Click the \"Close\" link\n### What is Expected?\n- Again, the popup closes successfully\n### What is actually happening?\n- Vue fails to call an internal function that got missing.\n- The `closePopupUsingVIf` function attached to the \"Close\" link's click event never gets called.\n- The popup does not close.\n\nFor reference the codepen contains the exact same implementation of the popup with the only difference that it uses `v-show` instead of `v-if` to show/hide the popup. `v-show` works perfectly.\n","closed_by":{"login":"yyx990803","id":499550,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5OTU1MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/499550?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yyx990803","html_url":"https://github.com/yyx990803","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yyx990803/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yyx990803/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yyx990803/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yyx990803/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yyx990803/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yyx990803/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yyx990803/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yyx990803/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yyx990803/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vuejs/vue/issues/3518/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vuejs/vue/issues/3518/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
