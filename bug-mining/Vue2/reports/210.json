Any inputs following the v-for rows get re-created (and lose their value), while inputs above remain as they are. This only seems to happen when the inputs and v-for element are contained in a parent component's slot.\r\n\r\n### What is expected?\r\nAll inputs remain unchanged--regardless of what happens to the sibling v-for element.\r\n\r\n### What is actually happening?\r\nAny input elements following the v-for are re-created--resetting their value.\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.
