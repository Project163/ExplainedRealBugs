a question?\r\n===\r\nThe issue list of this repo is **exclusively** for bug reports and feature requests. For simple questions, please use the following resources:\r\n\r\n- Read the docs: http://quasar-framework.org\r\n- For simple/quick questions ask in the Gitter chat room: https://gitter.im/quasarframework/Lobby\r\n- For complex questions or requiring help, ask on the forum: http://forum.quasar-framework.org/\r\n\r\nReporting a bug?\r\n================\r\n- Are you sure it isn't already reported? Do a search first! It may have already been answered or even fixed in the development branch (`dev`).\r\n\r\n- Are you sure you are reporting to the right repo? If you are not reporting an issue which deals directly with Quasar distributable, then there are [multiple Quasar repos](https://github.com/quasarframework) besides this one:\r\n  -- Quasar CLI: https://github.com/quasarframework/quasar-cli\r\n  -- Quasar Starter Kit (project folder template): https://github.com/quasarframework/quasar-template-default\r\n  -- Electron Wrapper: https://github.com/quasarframework/electron-wrapper\r\n  -- Quasar Play: https://github.com/quasarframework/quasar-play\r\n  -- Documentation Website: https://github.com/quasarframework/quasar-framework.org\r\n\r\n- Check if the issue is reproducible with the latest stable version of Quasar. If you are using a pre-release, please indicate the specific version you are using.\r\n\r\n- It is **required** that you clearly describe the steps necessary to reproduce the issue you are running into. Issues with no clear repro steps will not be triaged. If an issue labeled \"need repro\" receives no further input from the issue author for more than 5 days, it will be closed.\r\n\r\n- If your issue is resolved but still open, don’t hesitate to close it. In case you found a solution by yourself, it could be helpful to explain how you fixed it.\r\n\r\nHave a feature suggestion/request?\r\n=======================\r\nRemove the template from below and provide thoughtful commentary *and code samples* on what this feature means for your product. What will it allow you to do that you can't do today? How will it make current work-arounds straightforward? What potential bugs and edge cases does it help to avoid? etc. Please keep it product-centric.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<!-- BUG REPORT TEMPLATE -->\r\n### Software version\r\n\r\nQuasar: quasarframework/quasar-edge#2e51575\r\nOS: Mac OS X Sierra 10.10.25\r\nNode: 6.10.3 & 8.1.4\r\nNPM: 3.10.10(Node 6) & 5.0.3(Node 8)\r\nBrowsers: Chrome Version 60.0.3112.66 (Official Build) beta (64-bit)\r\niOS:\r\nAndroid:\r\nAny other software related to your bug:\r\n\r\n### What did you get as the error?\r\n```\r\n[Vue warn]: Injection \"__field\" not found\r\n\r\nfound in\r\n\r\n---> <QInputFrame>\r\n       <QUploader>\r\n         <QModal>\r\n           <PageGallery> at /Users/jskrzypek/dev/my-vue-project/src/pages/storage/Gallery.vue\r\n             <QScrollArea>\r\n               <QLayout>\r\n                 <PageStorage> at /Users/jskrzypek/dev/my-vue-project/src/pages/storage/Storage.vue\r\n                   <QLayout>\r\n                     <PageDashboard> at /Users/jskrzypek/dev/my-vue-project/src/pages/dashboard/Dashboard.vue\r\n                       <App> at /Users/jskrzypek/dev/my-vue-project/src/App.vue\r\n                         <Root>\r\n```\r\n### What were you expecting?\r\nNo error\r\n### What steps did you take, to get the error?\r\nThis happens at page load.
