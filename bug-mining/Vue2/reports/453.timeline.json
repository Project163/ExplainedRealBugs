Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\n1. provide a ref value with object/undefined\r\n2. display subcomponent conditionally with (`v-if=\"value\"`) \r\n3. watch some property of the injected value in the subcomponent\r\n4. set the ref to an object with the property, then after some time set the ref to undefined\r\n\r\n### What is expected?\r\n\r\nSince the subcomponent is displayed with v-if=\"value\" then when value changes to undefined the subcomponent should be destroyed and the watcher in the subcomponent shouldn't be triggered (and therefore it shouldn't fail)\r\n\r\n### What is actually happening?\r\n\r\n`Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'bar')`\r\n\r\n### System Info\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Any additional comments?\r\n\r\nSame behaviour can be observed in 2.7 ([demo](https://codepen.io/jkarczm/pen/yLKpzgb)), but not in 2.6  with `@vue/composition-api` ([demo](https://codepen.io/jkarczm/pen/MWVrrRb?editors=0010)) (that's how I discovered the problem)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vuejs/core/issues/6389/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vuejs/core/issues/6389/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"}]
