hmm  I played with this a bit further and turns out the issue is not related to domProps/attrs, because, adding`progress` tag to the

attrs.value !== oldAttrs.value)` then the issue is gone. I am not sure if throwing `isIE || isEdge` is the correct fix though and won't affect other things, so I think i will leave this issue to someone from the core team to fix
