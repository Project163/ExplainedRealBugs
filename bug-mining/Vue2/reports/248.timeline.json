several buttons at the same time fires several input events (one for each button the keyboard sends), that's ok.

前言\r\n`vue.js`的`nextTick`方法, 是非常有用而且也是经常用到的方法, 今天就来探讨一下这个方法实现的细节. 和我们用到setTimeout方法究竟有什么区别?\r\n\r\n### 下面是核心的源码结构\r\n直接奔着主题去, nextTick函数和setTimeout的区别, 主要体现在回调的执行时间.下面的timerFunc则是延迟函数, 有好几个`if-else`, 按照`promise->mutation observer->setImmediate->setTimeout`的顺序安排.\r\n```\r\nlet timerFunc;\r\n\r\nif (typeof Promise !== 'undefined' && isNative(Promise)) {\r\n  // 这直接使用原生的Promise 方法.\r\n} else if (\r\n  !isIE &&\r\n  typeof MutationObserver !== 'undefined' &&\r\n  (isNative(MutationObserver) || MutationObserver.toString() === '[object MutationObserverConstructor]')\r\n) {\r\n  // 使用MutationObserver\r\n} else if (typeof setImmediate !== 'undefined' && isNative(setImmediate)) {\r\n  // setImmediate\r\n} else {\r\n  // setTimeout\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport function nextTick(cb?: Function, ctx?: Object) {\r\n  ...\r\n}\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n详细的代码请移步[vuejs-next-tick,这里](https://github.com/vuejs/vue/blob/dev/src/core/util/next-tick.js)\r\n\r\n# 正文\r\n深入其中的`if-else`, 看到这几个判断, 其实我对以下几个问题, 还是挺好奇的.\r\n带着这几个问题, 去源码或者issue中, 找答案, 加深源码理解.\r\n- `setImmediate`比如`setTimeout`好? 区别在哪里?\r\n- 按照优先使用微任务, 最后使用宏任务的回调顺序, 宏任务的使用具体会出现什么问题? \r\n- 原生的`Promise,isNative`的方法是怎么实现?\r\n- IE 11 也可以用`MutationObserver`, 为什么要把IE排除在外?\r\n,`MutationObserver` 判断, 为什么需要加一个` MutationObserver.toString() === '[object MutationObserverConstructor]'`\r\n\r\n带着以上的疑问去源码项目中找答案.\r\n\r\n### 第一个问题: `setImmediate`比如`setTimeout`好在哪里?\r\n首先`setImmediate`的问题, setImmediate可以直接运行, setTimeout一个不好的地方就在js引擎需要和系统的时钟同步, 这个同步的频率在4ms, 也就是说`setTimeout`的回调, 至少需要4ms, 即使我们这么写`setTimeout(fn,0)`. \r\n\r\n但是`setImmediate`唯一一个不好的地方就是只有IE的浏览器支持, \r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13718019/63651763-2cf2c500-c78b-11e9-8792-e852bc98c722.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n### 第二个问题: 宏任务究竟有啥子不好? \r\n[vue-issue#6813](https://github.com/vuejs/vue/issues/6813), 在这问题中, 很好的揭示了nextTick使用了setTimeout的问题.\r\n[vue.js, v-2.51版本使用了setTimeout, resize下会出现repaint先比执行, 出现页面宽度小于1000px时候, 隐藏导航列表的抖动](https://codepen.io/ericcirone/pen/pWOrMB), \r\n\r\n首先捋一下代码的逻辑和重现的步骤. 代码如下面的截图, 红色的区块是重点部分.\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13718019/63652073-d9827600-c78e-11e9-8db6-080a91d60981.png)\r\n\r\n1. 宽度小于1000px 时, menu列表项以块元素显示, 宽度大于1000px时, 以内联元素显示, 这时所有的列表项都一行显示.\r\n2. 监听了window的resize的方法, 屏幕宽度小于1000px时, 会设置showList:false, 隐藏列表项目显示, 但这时会触发隐藏的样式display:list-item,问题就出现在谁在这2者的竞争上.\r\n\r\n就是出现设置`this.showList=false`, 上面,当缩放屏幕的宽度时,会触发2个事件, 一个是UI渲染(display:inline失效, 渲染display:list-item), 一个`resize`方法,`this.showList=false|true`, \r\n\r\n### resize方法会先比UI渲染先执行吗?为什么?\r\n\r\n假设resize方法先执行, UI渲染后执行, 那么会有什么问题?\r\n\r\n如果resize的方法有dom操作,需要重新UI渲染, 所以如果这一步UI渲染, 是会等待resize方法执行完之后, 执行一次UI渲染? 这样是可以节省开销, \r\n\r\n但是,如果resize方法卡死, 或者需要长时间占据cpu呢? 那么岂不是页面resize出现卡死? 而且resize的触发, 肯定会有防抖或节流的, 不可能resize每一个1px都会触发回调, 不然对cpu的压力过大. 所以有好处, 也会出现问题, 看看chrome的是怎么执行的?\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13718019/63658736-8be22980-c7df-11e9-884c-588c84447cd9.png)\r\n\r\n上面是chrome的performance性能测试, 在下面的Bottom-Up, 可以看到当前帧的具体运行顺序还有运行的时长, \r\n- 首先进行的是重新计算样式, 更新渲染树,\r\n-  再执行Event:resize的方法, 在resize方法的回调里面, 执行getComputedStyle\r\n\r\n但是, 这个顺序并不能说明问题, 因为这不是一个公平的竞争测试, 2个对比最重要的原因还是拖动调整浏览器的可视宽度的时候, 并不是每次都会触发resize的回调. 但是每次拖动调整浏览器的可视宽度, 即使一个像素的差别,都会触发浏览器端layout, repaint重流和重绘.\r\n\r\n但是, 如果我们在resize的代码之中添加\r\n```\r\nwhile(true){\r\n    \r\n}\r\n```\r\n就会发现, 这个时候,即使我们怎么拖动视窗调转大小,都不会渲染, 即使1px的变化, 也不会, 因为这个会浏览器主进程卡死, 后面的渲染进程一直都在队列中, 所以可以知道, 是先执行resize的回调, 再进行渲染操作, 这样可以节省渲染的开销.\r\n\r\n继续我们原来的问题, 我们在resize的回调中, 设置了showList, 这个时候,vuejs是利用nextTick的进行模板依赖的更新合并的. 把同一个事件循环的操作进行合并到下一个nextTick中, 而不必每一个赋值都同步更新依赖. 所以才会resize的抖动的问题, 因为UI渲染已经进入宏任务队列,并且排在下一个位置, 如果在resize的回调里面又再会有宏任务, 那么就会UI渲染的下一位置, 所以才出现的抖动, 先进行了一次UI渲染, showList:true或者false再生效.\r\n```\r\nexport function queueWatcher (watcher: Watcher) {\r\n  const id = watcher.id\r\n  if (has[id] == null) {\r\n    has[id] = true\r\n    if (!flushing) {\r\n      \r\n      queue.push(watcher)\r\n    } else {\r\n      // if already flushing, splice the watcher based on its id\r\n      // if already past its id, it will be run next immediately.\r\n      let i = queue.length - 1\r\n      while (i >= 0 && queue[i].id > watcher.id) {\r\n        i--\r\n      }\r\n      queue.splice(Math.max(i, index) + 1, 0, watcher)\r\n    }\r\n    // queue the flush\r\n    if (!waiting) {\r\n      waiting = true\r\n      nextTick(flushSchedulerQueue) // => here\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n### 第三个问题: 怎么判断一个Promise是不是原生的\r\n```\r\n/* istanbul ignore next */\r\nexport function isNative (Ctor: any): boolean {\r\n  return typeof Ctor === 'function' && /native code/.test(Ctor.toString())\r\n}\r\n```\r\n才留意到, 原来如果一个原生的方法, 我么打印到控制台的时候, 一般都有native code 的这样的字符串信息, 真是一个平时又容易忽略, 但是又实用的方法. 而且可用来判断所有的方法.\r\n\r\n### 第四个问题: IE 的`MutationObserver` 有什么问题? \r\n最后一个疑问是, IE下面的使用会有什么问题? 看到这个疑问是在在next-tick的函数注释中, 该问题略微的提了一下, 使用IE mutationObserver在双向绑定的时候, 有可能会出现多次按钮随机丢失字符的情况\r\n,问题issue在这里[IE11: Keystrokes missing if v-model is used](https://github.com/vuejs/vue/issues/6466), 具体的重现在IE11下请看[这里](http://jsfiddle.net/zjsuzqgu/15/), 有IE11环境的可以重现一下试试, 这个问题环境问题, 我并没有重现出来.\r\n\r\n但是可以在caniuse上面, 就是关于IE11的issue\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13718019/63730220-e7beb800-c89c-11e9-8b1b-4e63bccb70df.png)\r\n\r\n所以在next-tick的函数中, 就避免了使用IE的mutation Observer的方法\r\n```\r\nif (\r\n  !isIE &&\r\n  typeof MutationObserver !== 'undefined' &&\r\n  (isNative(MutationObserver) || MutationObserver.toString() === '[object MutationObserverConstructor]')\r\n){ ... }\r\n```\r\n而对于在 `PhantomJS and iOS 7.x`, `MutationObserver`的判断, 需要用`MutationObserver.toString() === '[object MutationObserverConstructor'`.\r\n\r\n# 小结\r\n看源码和社区博客, github的issue, 各种各样的人发表对问题的深刻见解, 各种思维的碰撞, 真的是一种快捷的进步方式. 所以呼吁更多的人, 如果碰到开源项目的问题,不妨到issue和大家一起讨论, 拥抱开源.\r\n\r\n# 参考\r\n> [IE11: Keystrokes missing if v-model is used](https://github.com/vuejs/vue/issues/6466)\r\n\r\n> [v-show is firing late on
