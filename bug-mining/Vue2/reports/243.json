Create a template using <a> as the root element\r\n\r\n2. Try to use it in an <svg>\r\n\r\n### What is expected?\r\nI either expected vue to understand that the <a> is supposed to be an SVG a tag (and not an xhtml a tag), or a way for me to override vue's decision and give it the proper namespace (e.g. making <svg:a> work ?)\r\n\r\n### What is actually happening?\r\nVue is creating the <a> tag as an xhtml:a tag, and so the browser doesn't render it.\r\n\r\nYou can make it render by wrapping it in an <svg>. This is undesirable however, for many reasons. Having a way to explicitly tell vue the namespace from which to create the element would be nice.\r\n\r\n---\r\nSVG &lt;a&gt; tag : https://developer.mozilla.org/fr/docs/Web/SVG/Element/a\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.
