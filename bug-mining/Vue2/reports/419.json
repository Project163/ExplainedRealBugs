I would like to use it this way:\r\n```html\r\n<tr is=\"custom-row\" v-slot=\"slotProps\">\r\n    slotProps: {{slotProps.test}}\r\n</tr>\r\n```\r\n\r\n### What is expected?\r\nNo warning.\r\n\r\n### What is actually happening?\r\nI get the following warning in the console. \r\n>```\r\n>[Vue warn]: Error compiling template:\r\n>v-slot can only be used on components or <template>.\r\n>```\r\n\r\nThe rest looks like it works as expected.\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.
