Environment\r\n**Vuetify Version:** 2.1.10\r\n**Vue Version:** 2.6.10\r\n**Browsers:** Chrome 78.0.3904.97\r\n**OS:** Windows 10\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\n```\r\n<v-data-table ....... @click:row.ctrl=\"rowCtrlClicked\"> ........ </v-data-table>\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Expected Behavior\r\nEvent handler fires\r\n\r\n### Actual Behavior\r\nEvent handler does not fire\r\n\r\n### Reproduction Link\r\n<a href=\"https://codepen.io/jim55063/pen/PooXgWY?&editable=true&editors=101#anon-signup\" target=\"_blank\">https://codepen.io/jim55063/pen/PooXgWY?&editable=true&editors=101#anon-signup</a>\r\n\r\n### Other comments\r\nI am replacing an existing data table in our application which allows the user to ctrl+click a row in the table and open that item in a new window (tab).\r\n\r\n```@click:row.once``` works, since it doesn't require the event object to be passed to the ```.once``` event modifier. But for the ```.ctrl``` modifier, since you aren't passing the event to the modifier, it can't check to see if the control key is pressed and filters the event out and the handler isn't called.\r\n\r\nAlso, since the event isn't passed to the handler, there is no way to know if the user had the ctrl key held down when the row was clicked.\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vuetify-issue-helper.
