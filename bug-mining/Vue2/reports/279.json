Their order is changed with a v-if condition.\r\n\r\n### What is actually happening?\r\nThe slots do not switch order. The first slot seems to switch, the second slot seems to stay in place. \r\n\r\nInstead of:\r\n1,2 to 2,1 \r\n\r\nThis happens:\r\n1,2 to 2,2\r\n\r\nWe have tried this with more slots and the results are unpredictable.\r\n\r\n---\r\nWe are changing the order of slots for features that change location on small or big screens. Sometimes the structure of a page changes too much so we change the order of slots to manage this. We only noticed the bug when we set the env to production. All works fine in development mode.\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.
