Unsure if it is broken on other old versions of Firefox. \r\n* Click on show button (this is important, click handlers work if they are bound when `currentFlushTimestamp` is 0). \r\n * This will show a second button,  this button will increment the `count` variable every time it is clicked, except Firefox52 ESR\r\n\r\n### What is expected?\r\n`count` variable will increment\r\n\r\n### What is actually happening?\r\nClick handler is not firing. I've done some digging into the vue.js code and it seems due to this part of the code being incorrect, or at least the timestamp Firefox has for the event is incorrect:\r\n\r\n`handler = original._wrapper = function (e) {\r\n        if (e.timeStamp >= attachedTimestamp) {\r\n          return original.apply(this, arguments)\r\n        }\r\n      };`\r\n\r\nOn this version of Firefox,  e.timeStamp is less than attachedTimestamp\r\n\r\n---\r\nOur application is built on vue.js but we have a lot of users who use Firefox 52 ESR for it's compatibility with Silverlight and upgrading is not an option right now.\r\n\r\nSome further things I found when digging: \r\n`document.createEvent('Event').timeStamp` returns `1549471218936000` which means that vue will think that the event time is based on Date.now() rather than performance.now().\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.
