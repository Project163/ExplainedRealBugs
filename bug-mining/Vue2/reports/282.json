For recursive components, make sure to provide the \"name\" option.\r\n\r\n(found in <Root>)\r\n```\r\n\r\n### What is actually happening?\r\nSSR simply renders invalid HTML:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<div data-server-rendered=\"true\"><bing-bang></bing-bang></div>\r\n```\r\n\r\nwithout any warnings.\r\n\r\n---\r\nThis inconsistency makes it hard to refactor big Nuxt.js apps, as missing/unregistered components get silently ignored.\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.
