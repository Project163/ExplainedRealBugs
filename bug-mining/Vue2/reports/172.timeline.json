The handler method should emit the new `v-model` value.\r\n\r\n### What is actually happening?\r\nPossible incompatibility issue with Phantom. An initial click on the checkbox should change the value bound in the `v-model` to `true`. Instead, it reports `false`. The v-model value **is** changing with each click. It appears the handler bound to the `@change` event is being called before the v-model value is being updated. This is only happening with Phantom, but works as expected everywhere else.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vuejs/vue/issues/4896/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vuejs/vue/issues/4896/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vuejs/vue/issues/comments/281529867","html_url":"https://github.com/vuejs/vue/issues/4796#issuecomment-281529867","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vuejs/vue/issues/4796","id":281529867,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI4MTUyOTg2Nw==","user":{"login":"yyx990803","id":499550,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5OTU1MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/499550?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yyx990803","html_url":"https://github.com/yyx990803","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yyx990803/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yyx990803/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yyx990803/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yyx990803/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yyx990803/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yyx990803/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yyx990803/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yyx990803/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yyx990803/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-02-22T00:38:41Z","updated_at":"2017-02-22T00:39:15Z","body":"@jdalton update: it seems PhantomJS and Safari also fire `change` before `click`.\r\n\r\nThe [spec](https://www.w3.org/TR/uievents/#event-flow-default-cancel) states that:\r\n\r\n> Default actions are usually performed after the event dispatch has been completed, but in exceptional cases they may also be performed immediately before the event is dispatched.\r\n\r\nSo technically, `change` doesn't have to be fired after `click`. However, imo it really should because logically, `change` is a result of the default action for `click`. For example, if I do `event.preventDefault()` inside a click listener on a checkbox, it should be able to prevent the `change` event from happening altogether (this is the current behavior in Chrome/FF, but not in Safari/IE/Edge/PhantomJS).","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vuejs/vue/issues/comments/281529867/reactions","total_count":3,"+1":3,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"yyx990803","id":499550,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5OTU1MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/499550?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yyx990803","html_url":"https://github.com/yyx990803","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yyx990803/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yyx990803/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yyx990803/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yyx990803/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yyx990803/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yyx990803/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yyx990803/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yyx990803/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yyx990803/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":971747333,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50OTcxNzQ3MzMz","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vuejs/vue/issues/events/971747333","actor":{"login":"jdalton","id":4303,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzMDM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4303?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdalton","html_url":"https://github.com/jdalton","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdalton/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdalton/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdalton/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdalton/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdalton/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdalton/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdalton/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdalton/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdalton/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2017-02-22T00:38:41Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":971747334,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDk3MTc0NzMzNA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vuejs/vue/issues/events/971747334","actor":{"login":"jdalton","id":4303,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzMDM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4303?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdalton","html_url":"https://github.com/jdalton","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdalton/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdalton/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdalton/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdalton/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdalton/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdalton/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdalton/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdalton/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdalton/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2017-02-22T00:38:41Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vuejs/vue/issues/comments/281530616","html_url":"https://github.com/vuejs/vue/issues/4796#issuecomment-281530616","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vuejs/vue/issues/4796","id":281530616,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI4MTUzMDYxNg==","user":{"login":"jdalton","id":4303,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzMDM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4303?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdalton","html_url":"https://github.com/jdalton","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdalton/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdalton/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdalton/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdalton/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdalton/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdalton/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdalton/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdalton/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdalton/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-02-22T00:42:53Z","updated_at":"2017-02-22T00:42:53Z","body":"Oh
