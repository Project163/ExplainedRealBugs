This exposes a bug (#3846), where the regex fails if the template happens to have \" in \" or \" of \" in its last group. For instance, with the template `for key in [{body: 'Hey in body'}]`, current regex will capture the last group as `body'}]` instead of `[{body: 'Hey in body'}]`. This commit aims to fix this issue by making the first rule lazy instead.\n\nI don't think this really needs a test, but let me know if it does.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vuejs/vue/issues/3859/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vuejs/vue/issues/3859/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":814233686,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDgxNDIzMzY4Ng==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vuejs/vue/issues/events/814233686","actor":{"login":"phanan","id":8056274,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgwNTYyNzQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8056274?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/phanan","html_url":"https://github.com/phanan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phanan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phanan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phanan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phanan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phanan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phanan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phanan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phanan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phanan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"e6dbfb9a213be68808a07cafd6f0fe4dbec0f877","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/phanan-forks/vue/commits/e6dbfb9a213be68808a07cafd6f0fe4dbec0f877","created_at":"2016-10-06T04:40:30Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":816831021,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50ODE2ODMxMDIx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vuejs/vue/issues/events/816831021","actor":{"login":"yyx990803","id":499550,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5OTU1MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/499550?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yyx990803","html_url":"https://github.com/yyx990803","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yyx990803/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yyx990803/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yyx990803/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yyx990803/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yyx990803/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yyx990803/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yyx990803/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yyx990803/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yyx990803/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":"adae5caaeea2c8bd18e21a87d83ed7251b862a67","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vuejs/vue/commits/adae5caaeea2c8bd18e21a87d83ed7251b862a67","created_at":"2016-10-07T21:40:19Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
