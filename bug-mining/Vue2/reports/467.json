Vue 2 diagram does not make any mention of the `setup` function. I would expect that the order of `setup` vs `beforeCreate` would be consistent between 2.7 and 3.x.\r\n\r\nMinimal reproduction repo to observe vue 3 behavior: https://codepen.io/vetruvet/pen/LYmePyN\r\n\r\nWhy a mixin and why `beforeCreate`? This behavior is coming from a third-party library I don't control. The code I need to run in the `setup` function needs to access variables that are only available in the setup function and at the same time needs to run before that 3rd-party code in the `beforeCreate` hook.\r\n\r\nLooking at the where the hooks are called, `beforeCreate` is indeed called before `setup` (https://github.com/vuejs/vue/blob/v2.7.10/src/core/instance/init.ts#L62 and two lines down `initState` calls `initSetup`)\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.
