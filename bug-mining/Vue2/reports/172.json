Open the above fiddle in a Firefox or a Webkit-based browser\r\n2. Check the checkboxes and note the array of selected items being updated correctly\r\n3. Open the above fiddle in IE or Edge\r\n4. Check the checkboxes and note the difference in behaviour to step 2\r\n\r\n### Expected Outcome\r\nThe array of selected items (and the raw output) should be updated as each item is checked.\r\n\r\n### Actual Outcome\r\nIn IE and Edge the raw output is displaying a boolean value and the checked state of the checkboxes is inconsistent.\r\n\r\nThanks!","closed_by":{"login":"yyx990803","id":499550,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5OTU1MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/499550?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yyx990803","html_url":"https://github.com/yyx990803","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yyx990803/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yyx990803/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yyx990803/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yyx990803/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yyx990803/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yyx990803/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yyx990803/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yyx990803/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yyx990803/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vuejs/vue/issues/4796/reactions","total_count":6,"+1":5,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":1,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vuejs/vue/issues/4796/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
