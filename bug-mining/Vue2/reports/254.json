The assembly of the components is for some reason very fragile which makes me think that this is a bug. For example, if I remove the top-most `layout` component that shouldn't affect the code, the warning disappears: http://jsfiddle.net/vjvMp/2020/\r\n\r\n### What is expected?\r\nFor the slot on the Child to be hoisted up to the Parent and rendered above the Child without problem.\r\n\r\n### What is actually happening?\r\nThe Child gets rendered but there is an infinite update loop warning.\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.
