However we need the class structure to invoke functions, access getters, etc.\r\n\r\n### What is actually happening?\r\nWe can't access the class structure of the object that was bind as we're just getting a new Object instance rather than the reference.\r\n\r\n---\r\nThis is related to https://github.com/vuejs/vue/issues/4529 which lets the slot bind to an object. The thing is, I would like to invoke the functions of the object's class that was passed over. With the current situation, it is not doable as it's creating a new Object instance instead of just referencing the object which was bind to the slot.\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.
