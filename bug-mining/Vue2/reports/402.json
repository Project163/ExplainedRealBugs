The QT version used is quite old and so is the included QtWebEngine fork of Chrome. The upgrade from Vue 2.5 to 2.6 broke event bubbling in this older version of chrome, apparently because `event.timeStamp` is a very negative number (such as -518605237).\r\n\r\n```js\r\n/* add$1 */\r\ne.target === e.currentTarget // false since we are clicking children of the div\r\n\r\ne.timeStamp >= attachedTimestamp // false since -518605237 < 0\r\n\r\ne.timeStamp === 0 // false since -518605237 != 0\r\n\r\ne.target.ownerDocument !== document // false since we are the same document\r\n```\r\n\r\nMaybe there is a way to disable the microtask behaviour for this browser?\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.
