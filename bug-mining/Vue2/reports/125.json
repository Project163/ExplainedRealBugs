Create a `<transition>` tag.\r\n2. Set the transition tag to not rely on CSS with `:css=\"false\"`, as well as trigger on `appear`.\r\n3. Add a `v-show` for an element inside the `<transition>` tag.\r\n4. Add an `@enter` callback for the transition, and call `done` inside the callback.\r\n\r\n### What is Expected?\r\nThe element toggled with `v-show` is visually present (i.e. __not__ `display: none`) when in the `@enter` callback—even before the call to `done`—just as it is with `v-if`.\r\n\r\n### What is actually happening?\r\nVue keeps (defers removal of) `display: none`until after `@after-enter`.\r\n\r\nCallbacks for `v-if` and `v-show` are thus not interchangeable.\r\nE.g.: starting an animation on `@enter` that relies on retrieving the global position of an element would work for `v-if`, but fail for `v-show` due to the lack of offsets/offset parents as a result of `display: none`.\r\n\r\nRelevant:  https://github.com/vuejs/vue/blob/ae93d2bef8e20402ae3501aa5cdcf14b0ee19c12/src/platforms/web/runtime/directives/show.js#L31-L32 ?\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"yyx990803","id":499550,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5OTU1MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/499550?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yyx990803","html_url":"https://github.com/yyx990803","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yyx990803/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yyx990803/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yyx990803/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yyx990803/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yyx990803/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yyx990803/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yyx990803/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yyx990803/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yyx990803/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vuejs/vue/issues/4418/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vuejs/vue/issues/4418/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
