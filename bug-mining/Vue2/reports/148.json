Resets `values` to an array of values every one second\r\n2. Each line has two checkboxes, both of which are bound to the same value\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n1. *Click* on the enabled checkbox on any line\r\n\r\nExpected behaviour:\r\n1. After one second, the value should be reset. Both checkboxes should reflect the same value\r\n\r\nActual behaviour (tested on Chrome):\r\n1. The disabled checkbox correctly reflects the value, but the enabled checkbox does not reflect the value. The enabled checkbox will reflect the correct value only after blurring from the checkbox","closed_by":{"login":"yyx990803","id":499550,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5OTU1MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/499550?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yyx990803","html_url":"https://github.com/yyx990803","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yyx990803/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yyx990803/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yyx990803/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yyx990803/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yyx990803/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yyx990803/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yyx990803/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yyx990803/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yyx990803/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vuejs/vue/issues/4620/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vuejs/vue/issues/4620/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
