thanks for filling this issue.\r\n`Good rendering speed` is way too broad, and without a benchmark comparison between other frameworks we cannot settle on a reasonable definition of `Good`.\r\nVue has always been dedicated to improving rendering performance, but unfortunately this issue can't really help us improve anything, since it's more of a complaint rather than constructive ideas on what exactly can be improved, so I'm closing
