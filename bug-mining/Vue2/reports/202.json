Create a component with a `slot` repeated over `v-for` and `name`d with the index, then render the slot elements in the parent component using matching indices. Set the index to be `0..n` integers (i.e. a non-associative array).\r\n\r\n### What is expected?\r\nAll elements that are rendered with `v-for` and slot index should be rendered properly from the parent component data.\r\n\r\n### What is actually happening?\r\nThe very first element defined with `v-for` is somehow skipped when rendering.\r\n\r\n---\r\nI'm building a modular repeater field where you can add and remove items which are synced via basic events. The items are slotted in via item indices which are in sync by setting the slot index inside the custom component when rendered inside the parent.\r\n\r\nCan this be related to 0-based indices or something? When I replace the `slot` `name` with `:name=\"'item' index\"` the rendering works as expected.\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.
