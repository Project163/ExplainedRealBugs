Markup**\r\n`<transition name=\"fade\" mode=\"out-in\">\r\n    <component :is=\"selectedModule\"></component>\r\n</transition>`\r\n\r\n**Components Load**\r\n`Vue.component('component-a', httpVueLoader.load('app/components/component-a.vue', 'component-a'));\r\nVue.component('component-b', httpVueLoader.load('app/components/component-b.vue', 'component-b'));\r\nVue.component('component-c', httpVueLoader.load('app/components/component-c.vue', 'component-c'));`\r\n\r\nIt appears the _out-in_ transition behaves the same as the _in-out_ transition (Component B fades in before/during Component A fade out), but only on the first load of the component.  If switching between previously loaded (cached?) components, transitions behave as expected.  Please see the attached GIF demonstrating the behavior.\r\n\r\nI've been digging into the source in hopes to address this myself through a pull request, but unfortunately I'm very new to Vue and some of this is still a mystery to me.  If there's anything else I can provide, I'm happy to do so.  Thanks!\r\n\r\n**Demo GIF**\r\n![vuetransitionerror_20170524](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/6201067/26434297/a152ca7c-40cd-11e7-8528-4c9ff92e6bf0.gif)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FranckFreiburger/http-vue-loader/issues/6/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/FranckFreiburger/http-vue-loader/issues/6/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":1452165522,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDE0NTIxNjU1MjI=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vuejs/vue/issues/events/1452165522","actor":{"login":"liuliangsir","id":8049878,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgwNDk4Nzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8049878?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuliangsir","html_url":"https://github.com/liuliangsir","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuliangsir/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuliangsir/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuliangsir/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuliangsir/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuliangsir/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuliangsir/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuliangsir/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuliangsir/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuliangsir/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"200b8dfb5bde0ef9bb34bab8ddea1549c6842e2c","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/liuliangsir/vue/commits/200b8dfb5bde0ef9bb34bab8ddea1549c6842e2c","created_at":"2018-02-01T03:35:13Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":1474454796,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDE0NzQ0NTQ3OTY=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vuejs/vue/issues/events/1474454796","actor":{"login":"ztlevi","id":16655096,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NjU1MDk2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16655096?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ztlevi","html_url":"https://github.com/ztlevi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ztlevi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ztlevi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ztlevi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ztlevi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ztlevi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ztlevi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ztlevi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ztlevi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ztlevi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"0d6cbff5fadd1fe8f2dc76aebe041ab0f48d5930","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ztlevi/vue/commits/0d6cbff5fadd1fe8f2dc76aebe041ab0f48d5930","created_at":"2018-02-14T18:49:51Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2096742928,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDIwOTY3NDI5Mjg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vuejs/vue/issues/events/2096742928","actor":{"login":"f2009","id":28625332,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4NjI1MzMy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/28625332?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/f2009","html_url":"https://github.com/f2009","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/f2009/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/f2009/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/f2009/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/f2009/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/f2009/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/f2009/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/f2009/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/f2009/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/f2009/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"51f2139fba8ba04124ab00d31546f085dc92446f","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/f2009/vue/commits/51f2139fba8ba04124ab00d31546f085dc92446f","created_at":"2019-01-25T09:52:50Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
