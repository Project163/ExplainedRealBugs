stumbled on this issue myself. Handling composition events in an MVC way does not seem to be doable with current browser behavior. It is a breaker for a live search/live autocompletion functionality.\r\n\r\nAs of now, the best way for me to handle this was to make a form with input element and re-read it on every compositionupdate event. This seems to be the only hack that works with UC browser. For some reason, UC does update the inputs inside forms on composition, yet it gives undefined as event data...\r\n\r\nIt will be very very good is there will be a standard way set by upstream how to handle that, and proper explanation of bug's nature across browsers in docs.\r\n\r\nFor me, I'm afraid, the cross browser solution will involve hardcoded hack for each major browser

Versions and Environment\r\n**Vuetify:** 1.3.11\r\n**Vue:** 2.5.17\r\n**Browsers:** Maxthon 5.2.5.4000, Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Safari, Microsoft Edge, Internet Explorer, Opera, Other\r\n**OS:** iOS, Mac OSX\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\n1. a v-text-field use v-model bind a computed attribute\r\n```\r\n<v-text-field\r\n    label=\"Chinese input | 中文输入\"\r\n    v-model=\"inputFormatted\"\r\n></v-text-field>\r\n```\r\n2. change input value in set method of computed attribute\r\n```\r\n  data: ()=>({\r\n    inputValue: ''\r\n  }),\r\n  computed: {\r\n    inputFormatted: {\r\n      get(){\r\n        return this.inputValue\r\n      },\r\n      set(val) {\r\n        this.inputValue = val.toUpperCase()\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n3. The code in set method will break the default chinese input method in iOS and macOS, which will prevent you from entering Chinese character\r\n\r\n\r\n### Expected Behavior\r\ntext field wait IME input to end\r\n\r\n### Actual Behavior\r\ntext field interrupts the input of IME and can't input chinese character\r\n\r\n### Reproduction Link\r\n<a href=\"https://codepen.io/lazylz/pen/WYgmBb\" target=\"_blank\">https://codepen.io/lazylz/pen/WYgmBb</a>\r\n\r\n### Other comments\r\nThis problem can also occur in other languages  that require an IME (Japanese, Korean etc.)\r\nthis issue not happened on native input tag，because v-model waits input method input to end (use compositionend event) before it refresh value\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vuetify-issue-helper.
