@seekerlee I think `v-once` should be used in the same element as the `v-for` element because `v-once` is executed before the `v-for` and therefore the `item` variable doesn't exist yet\n\nAs a side note: don't use `v-once` if you don't need it yet 😛

here's my case just for reference:\n\nWe are working on en email app and emails are rendered by VueJS since 1.x version.\nemails in a conversation are stored in an array like below:\n`\ndata:{emails: [{\nread:false,\nstarred:false,\ncontent:'<div> html format data</div>'\n},{\nread:false,\nstarred:true,\ncontent:'<div> html format data2</div>'\n}]}\n`\n\nSince the email html content could be huge, we don't want it be updated since born. And we need to do lots of DOM operation to the html content (I'm using a custom directive to do it when 'inserted'). For example: add ellipsis and hide quoted content, highlight some text, add some link, process mentions by @ symbol etc. We also don't want these operations to be executed more than once.\n\nSo we have the requirement for both v-once and v-for.\nIn 1.x version we use {{{\\* email.content }}}, and it works good. After I spent some time updated VueJS to this version, I found this issue.\n","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vuejs/vue/issues/comments/256000853/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":2,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"seekerlee","id":1234986,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMzQ5ODY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1234986?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/seekerlee","html_url":"https://github.com/seekerlee","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seekerlee/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seekerlee/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seekerlee/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seekerlee/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seekerlee/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seekerlee/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seekerlee/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seekerlee/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/seekerlee/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":835251683,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50ODM1MjUxNjgz","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vuejs/vue/issues/events/835251683","actor":{"login":"posva","id":664177,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2NDE3Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/664177?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/posva","html_url":"https://github.com/posva","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/posva/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/posva/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/posva/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/posva/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/posva/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/posva/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/posva/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/posva/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/posva/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2016-10-25T10:43:19Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":835251684,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDgzNTI1MTY4NA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vuejs/vue/issues/events/835251684","actor":{"login":"posva","id":664177,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2NDE3Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/664177?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/posva","html_url":"https://github.com/posva","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/posva/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/posva/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/posva/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/posva/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/posva/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/posva/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/posva/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/posva/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/posva/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2016-10-25T10:43:19Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vuejs/vue/issues/comments/256589754","html_url":"https://github.com/vuejs/vue/issues/3964#issuecomment-256589754","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vuejs/vue/issues/3964","id":256589754,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI1NjU4OTc1NA==","user":{"login":"posva","id":664177,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2NDE3Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/664177?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/posva","html_url":"https://github.com/posva","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/posva/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/posva/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/posva/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/posva/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/posva/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/posva/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/posva/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/posva/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/posva/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-10-27T09:15:55Z","updated_at":"2016-10-27T09:15:55Z","body":"But
