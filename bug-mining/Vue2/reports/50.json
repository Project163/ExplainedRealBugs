(It also works in both cases if I use Vue v1).\nIn Chrome and Firefox, both versions are working.\n### What is actually happening?\n\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/2098462/18436183/41c68f1a-78f7-11e6-810d-d28fb3106b48.png)\n\n(Here you can see the `#app` div completely missing in the DOM tree.)\n\nWhen using IE (11, in my case) or Edge, the whole root element (`#app`) gets completely thrown out of the DOM as soon as Vue starts rendering. This happens regardless of emulated document mode (Edge, 10, 9 all behave the same).\n\n(I was _not_ able to reproduce this bug in a JSFiddle, even when using exactly this code. But in the examples above, it does happen).
