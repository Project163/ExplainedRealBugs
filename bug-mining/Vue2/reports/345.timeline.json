An error is thrown and caught by both App.vue and the global handler.\r\nClick the method button. An error is thrown but not caught by anything.\r\n\r\n### What is expected?\r\nThe error handler of parents (and the global handler if propagated) should be called for all errors thrown in a child component. I would expect that this would happen no matter where the error is thrown. Of course async/promise code is a reasonable exception as I understand that to be a language limitation.\r\n\r\n### What is actually happening?\r\nThe error is not caught by any handler.\r\n\r\n---\r\nThis is similar to [#8567](https://github.com/vuejs/vue/issues/8567). Is there any documentation on exactly which parts of components you can throw errors in and expect them to be caught by the parent(s)?\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.
