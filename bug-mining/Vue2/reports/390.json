You can see how it behaves on the same code with `vue 2.5.22`. I have deployed same code with downgraded Vue version here: http://slot-updates-vue-25.surge.sh/\r\n\r\n### What is actually happening?\r\nThe item inside v-for in a v-slot is not re-rendered:\r\nhttps://github.com/jedrula/slot-updates-on-vue-2.6/blob/master/src/App.vue#L6\r\n\r\n---\r\nI know that the issue can be resolved by providing proper v-key to the v-for. The confusing part though is that the even without the v-key this line is updated: https://github.com/jedrula/slot-updates-on-vue-2.6/blob/master/src/App.vue#L4 but this line is not: https://github.com/jedrula/slot-updates-on-vue-2.6/blob/master/src/App.vue#L6.\r\n\r\nIf that's not a bug but something I don't understand about scoped slots it might be good to add some information about that in some Vue reactivity gotchas ? I wonder why it bit me given a change from 2.5 -> 2.6 should not be breaking.\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.
