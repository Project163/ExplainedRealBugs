I would expect this to always be one or the other, or to be resolved in order of declaration as when merging objects in JS ({...boundProps, specificProp })\r\n\r\n### What is actually happening?\r\nThe precedence is determined based on whether a prop has multiple words. duplicate keys are set by the object when they are declared in dash-case, and set by the prop/attribute if they are camelCase or a single word.\r\n\r\n---\r\nThis can be made 'consistent' by declaring multiword props using camelcase, but that's against the recommendations in the styleguide which suggest using dash case for multiword props inside templates: https://vuejs.org/v2/style-guide/#Prop-name-casing-strongly-recommended.\r\n\r\nI ran into this when an undefined value bound to a parent was overriding the same value explicitly set in the child, but it wasn't happening consistently depending on what the names of the props were.\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.
