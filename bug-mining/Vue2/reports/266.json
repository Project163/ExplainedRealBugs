Make sure that this property is reactive, either in the data option, or for class-based components, by initializing the property. See: https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/reactivity.html#Declaring-Reactive-Properties.\r\n\r\n(found in <Root>)\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd it won't work if you switch from a normal type like text to a checkbox or radio button (the special types that are in the else branch: https://github.com/vuejs/vue/commit/f3fe012d5499f607656b152ce5fcb506c641f9f4#diff-6eaa1698ef4f51c9112e2e5dd84fcde8R4)\r\n\r\nClick the button (Click me) to switch the input to a checkbox, then try checking and unchecking the box. The model's value will not change.\r\n\r\nCalling the property `type` works, the model's value will change: https://jsfiddle.net/nkovacs/rt9vcrj2/2/\r\n\r\n### What is expected?\r\nDynamic input type should work regardless of the property name.\r\n\r\n### What is actually happening?\r\nDynamic input type only works if the property is called `type`\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.
