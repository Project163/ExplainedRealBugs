Problem to solve\r\nI have some code in a mixin which programatically assigns validation rules to v-input components during the mounted event. This code relies on v-input's $vnode.data.model.expression to get the v-model name used to bind the input. In versions prior to 1.1.1, this code worked great. In version 1.1.1 $vnode.data no longer contains the model property.\r\n\r\n### Proposed solution\r\nBring back $vnode.data.model.expression on v-input or provide an alternative method of determining the  v-model name used to bind an input.\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vuetify-issue-helper.

my solution until this is fixed in vue:\r\n```ts\r\nfunction dedupeModelListeners (data: VNodeData): void {\r\n  if (data.model && data.on && data.on.input) {\r\n    if (Array.isArray(data.on.input)) {\r\n      const i = data.on.input.indexOf(data.model.callback)\r\n      if (i > -1) data.on.input.splice(i, 1)\r\n    } else {\r\n      delete data.on.input\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vuejs/vue/issues/comments/414146631/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"KaelWD","id":16421948,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NDIxOTQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16421948?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/KaelWD","html_url":"https://github.com/KaelWD","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KaelWD/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KaelWD/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KaelWD/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KaelWD/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KaelWD/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KaelWD/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KaelWD/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KaelWD/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KaelWD/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":1996655973,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MTk5NjY1NTk3Mw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vuejs/vue/issues/events/1996655973","actor":{"login":"yyx990803","id":499550,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5OTU1MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/499550?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yyx990803","html_url":"https://github.com/yyx990803","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yyx990803/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yyx990803/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yyx990803/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yyx990803/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yyx990803/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yyx990803/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yyx990803/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yyx990803/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yyx990803/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":"7b7164c11cbb74ed44ee086f0a82acfcc1ff47a2","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vuejs/vue/commits/7b7164c11cbb74ed44ee086f0a82acfcc1ff47a2","created_at":"2018-11-29T23:11:58Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2036501523,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDIwMzY1MDE1MjM=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vuejs/vue/issues/events/2036501523","actor":{"login":"yyx990803","id":499550,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5OTU1MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/499550?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yyx990803","html_url":"https://github.com/yyx990803","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yyx990803/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yyx990803/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yyx990803/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yyx990803/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yyx990803/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yyx990803/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yyx990803/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yyx990803/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yyx990803/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"080dd971f77f7c631650c4e3027d1802f4e804d8","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vuejs/vue/commits/080dd971f77f7c631650c4e3027d1802f4e804d8","created_at":"2018-12-19T19:00:29Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2096743847,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDIwOTY3NDM4NDc=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vuejs/vue/issues/events/2096743847","actor":{"login":"f2009","id":28625332,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4NjI1MzMy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/28625332?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/f2009","html_url":"https://github.com/f2009","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/f2009/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/f2009/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/f2009/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/f2009/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/f2009/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/f2009/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/f2009/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/f2009/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/f2009/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"655d5b3ddf5301
