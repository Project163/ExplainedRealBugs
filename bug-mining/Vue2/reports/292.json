Among listeners, have only listener2 (comment out listener3 and listener1)\r\n\r\nCase 2. Among listeners, have listener3 and listener2 (comment out listener1)\r\n\r\n### What is expected?\r\nCase 1. Talker should be notified back on listener2 resolution\r\n\r\nCase 2. Talker should be notified back on listener2 resolution independently from (asynchronously to) listener3 resolution.\r\n\r\n### What is actually happening?\r\nCase 1. Talker has never notified back on listener2 resolution\r\n\r\nCase 2. Talker has notified back on listener2 resolution simultaneously (synchronously) to listener3 resolution (i.e.  listener2 resolution is delayed until listener 3 timed out)\r\n\r\n---\r\n\"Normal\" combinations are:\r\n\r\n* listener1 and listener3: listener1 resolves asynchronously to listener3\r\n* listener1 and listener2: both resolves (which is kinda surprising since listener2 alone never resolves, see Case 1 above)\r\n* listener3, listener2 and listener1\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.
