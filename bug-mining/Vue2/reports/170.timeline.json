Sorry for the delay. I believe it's a bug because if you wait for the first transition to finish there's no problem with the rest of the animations. It only happens if you add many items on the empty array without waiting for the first transition to finish.

\r\ni think this is the same issue ?\r\n\r\nFirst the problem is move-class is not occuring when i remove an item that is my problem\r\nSecond i dont use the name attribute for doing enter or leave animations\r\ncause i use animate.css for it\r\n\r\nPlease read carefully about this\r\n\r\nI'm also reading the docs and all of it before posting\r\n\r\n### Vue.js version\r\n2.1.10\r\n\r\n### Reproduction Link\r\n  - No Vue Components Used\r\n  https://jsfiddle.net/RalphChristianEclipse/9L8gvuej/5/\r\n  - Vue Material used\r\nhttps://jsfiddle.net/RalphChristianEclipse/9L8gvuej/7/\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\n  #### No Vue Components Used Steps: \r\n- Create transition group with display: flex\r\n- Create an array that will be used as a test\r\n- Assign card-move class to move-class of transition-group\r\n- Create a div element that uses v-for to list down all the test elements in array\r\n- Add a click event handler for removing an item\r\n #### Vue Material Used Steps: \r\n- Create a transtion group with class md-layout\r\n- Create an array for test\r\n- Assign card-move class to move-class of transition-group\r\n- Create another md-layout inside the transition-group with md-flex-{type}=\"33\" \r\n- Add a click.native handler for md-layout that removes items\r\n- create an md-card that uses v-for to list down the elements of the test array\r\n\r\n### What is Expected?\r\n- Smooth moving transition when changing positions\r\n### What is actually happening?\r\n- No Moving Transition happens\r\n\r\nI'm also doing this with an empty array and firebase will push elements in realtime\r\n\r\nThe documentation states when items are in display: flex move-class will be appended when changes in array position happens or
