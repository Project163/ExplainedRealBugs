Transition expects v-show to know when to start and to avoid this kind of code `<modal v-show=\"show\" :show=\"show\" />` the v-show would be set in the component root directly. The final code with transition would be simple as\n\n```\n<transition>\n  <modal show=\"show\" />\n<transition>\n```\n\nBut that would not work as transition expects v-show right there. There is a jsfiddle that illustrate the issue (just ignore the badly implemented transition css...).\n\nI see two ways to solve this:\n1. Make transition be aware of v-show set on the root it self\n2. Make available some event or way to trigger a transition programatically. That way from the compnent it self we could decide when that should happen.\n### Vue.js version\n\n2.0.0-rc1\n### Reproduction Link\n\nhttps://jsfiddle.net/miljan/8Lca03gb/\n### Steps to reproduce\n\nTry opening the modal\n### What is Expected?\n\nTo open with a transition, which does happen if you set v-show again in the component declaration.\n### What is actually happening?\n\nIt opens without a transition.\n","closed_by":{"login":"yyx990803","id":499550,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5OTU1MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/499550?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yyx990803","html_url":"https://github.com/yyx990803","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yyx990803/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yyx990803/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yyx990803/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yyx990803/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yyx990803/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yyx990803/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yyx990803/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yyx990803/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yyx990803/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vuejs/vue/issues/3431/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vuejs/vue/issues/3431/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
