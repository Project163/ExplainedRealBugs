Open reproduction link\n2. Go to /auth/register\n3. Play with step buttons, in console you'll see components are correctly activated/deactivated \n4. Click on the login button, you'll be redirected to home view (`/`) and in console you'll see that Auth/Login/Register components are properly destroyed, except components inside Register component. Their destroyed hook isn't called.\n### What is Expected?\n\nDynamic component inside nested `<keep-alive>` component should be always properly destroyed.\n\nIn my case, after redirecting from `/auth/register` to `/` you should see following logs in the console:\n\nAuth component destroyed\nLogin component destroyed\nRegister component destroyed\ndestroyed step X\n### What is actually happening?\n\nDestroyed hook in Step component is never called, which means that component itself is never destroyed. \n","closed_by":{"login":"yyx990803","id":499550,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5OTU1MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/499550?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yyx990803","html_url":"https://github.com/yyx990803","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yyx990803/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yyx990803/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yyx990803/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yyx990803/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yyx990803/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yyx990803/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yyx990803/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yyx990803/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yyx990803/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vuejs/vue/issues/3882/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vuejs/vue/issues/3882/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
