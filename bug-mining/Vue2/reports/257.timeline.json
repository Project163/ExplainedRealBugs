a little more study about this. It seems that in this demo: https://jsfiddle.net/r5gohw4w/ IE/Edge is correct to W3C HTML spec and Safari/Chrome is wrong.\r\n\r\nAs https://w3c.github.io/html/sec-forms.html#the-progress-element says:\r\n\r\n> if the parsed value was greater than or equal to the maximum value, then the current value of the progress bar is the maximum value of the progress bar.\r\n\r\nSo for `foo` in the demo if we set `50` to `value` first (before setting `100` to `max`), the current value (50) is greater than the maximum value (1.0). So the current value will be set as `1`. And then we set `100` to `max` so at the end the position of the `<progress>` element should be 1/100.\r\n\r\nAnyway it doesn't mean the syntax in Vue template is wrong or correct. Just about browser implementations.\r\n\r\n... and seems that using `if (attrs.value !== oldAttrs.value) { ... }` directly without browser detection matches the spec.\r\n\r\nThanks.","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vuejs/vue/issues/comments/331506523/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"Jinjiang","id":206848,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwNjg0OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/206848?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jinjiang","html_url":"https://github.com/Jinjiang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jinjiang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jinjiang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jinjiang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jinjiang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jinjiang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jinjiang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jinjiang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jinjiang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jinjiang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vuejs/vue/issues/comments/333732478","html_url":"https://github.com/vuejs/vue/issues/6666#issuecomment-333732478","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/vuejs/vue/issues/6666","id":333732478,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMzMzczMjQ3OA==","user":{"login":"yyx990803","id":499550,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5OTU1MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/499550?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yyx990803","html_url":"https://github.com/yyx990803","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yyx990803/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yyx990803/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yyx990803/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yyx990803/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yyx990803/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yyx990803/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yyx990803/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yyx990803/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yyx990803/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-10-03T04:00:55Z","updated_at":"2017-10-03T04:01:18Z","body":"I think this is related to how browsers handle updates.
