Add the following lines to src/main.ts:\r\n\r\n    import VueNativeSock from 'vue-native-websocket'\r\n    Vue.use(VueNativeSock, 'ws://localhost:9090', { store: store, format: 'json' })\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### What is expected?\r\nThat the vue.d.ts definition for the use function reflects the actual functionality.\r\n\r\n### What is actually happening?\r\nThe vue.d.ts definition only allows for the Plugin object or function and an options object. \r\n\r\n---\r\nThe actual function defined in vue/use.js takes in the Plugin object or function and any number of optional parameters, it doesn't actually ask for an options object, that's all up to the Plugin. \r\n\r\nMy suggestion would be to make the following change:\r\nThe vue.d.ts line 101 should be:\r\n\r\n    static use<T>(plugin: PluginObject<T> | PluginFunction<T>, ...additionalParams: any[]): void;\r\n\r\nand not:\r\n\r\n    static use<T>(plugin: PluginObject<T> | PluginFunction<T>, options?: T): void;\r\n  \r\nYou could have both options available, but the way that the function is written in use.js, the definition I've written above should be more correct.\r\n\r\n<!-- generated by vue-issues.
