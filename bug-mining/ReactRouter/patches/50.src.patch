 React Router uses a monorepo to host code for multiple packages. These packages live in the `packages` directory.
 
+React Router uses Lerna to manage the monorepo. Lerna sets up symlinks between the packages, so when you build one package, its changes will be automatically available to the packages that depend on it.

+### Building
+
+Calling `npm run build` from the root directory will build every package. If you want to build a specific package, you should `cd` into that directory.
+```bash
+# build everything
+npm run build
+# build react-router-dom
+cd packages/react-router-dom
+npm run build
+```

 ### Testing
 
 Calling `npm test` from the root directory will run **every** package's tests. If you want to run tests for a specific package, you should `cd` into that directory.

-## Hacking
