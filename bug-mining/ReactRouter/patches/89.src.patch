 React Router is a lightweight, fully-featured routing library for the [React](https://reactjs.org) JavaScript library. React Router runs everywhere that React runs; on the web, on the server (using node.js), and on React Native.
 
-**The current stable release of React Router is version 5, which you can find [on the `v5` branch](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/tree/v5). The current branch you are viewing is for version 6 which is under active development and should be released very soon.**
