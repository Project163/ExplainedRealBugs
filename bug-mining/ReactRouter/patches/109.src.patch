 ## Signature
 
 ```tsx
-useNavigate(): NavigateFunction
+navigate(
+  to: To,
+  options?: {
+    flushSync?: boolean;
+    preventScrollReset?: boolean;
+    relative?: RelativeRoutingType;
+    replace?: boolean;
+    state?: any;
+    viewTransition?: boolean;
+  }
+): void | Promise<void>;
 ```
+
+## Examples
+
+### Navigate to another path:
+
+```tsx
+navigate("/some/route");
+navigate("/some/route?search=param");
+```
+
+### Navigate with a `To` object:
+
+All properties are optional.
+
+```tsx
+navigate({
+  pathname: "/some/route",
+  search: "?search=param",
+  hash: "#hash",
+  state: { some: "state" },
+});
+```
+
+If you use `state`, that will be available on the `location` object on the next page. Access it with `useLocation().state` (see [useLocation](./useLocation)).
+
+### Navigate back or forward in the history stack:
+
+```tsx
+// back
+// often used to close modals
+navigate(-1);
+
+// forward
+// often used in a multi-step wizard workflows
+navigate(1);
+```
+
+Be cautions with `navigate(number)`. If your application can load up to a route that has a button that tries to navigate forward/back, there may not be a history entry to go back or forward to, or it can go somewhere you don't expect (like a different domain).
+
+Only use this if you're sure they will have an entry in the history stack to navigate to.
+
+### Replace the current entry in the history stack:
+
+This will remove the current entry in the history stack, replacing it with a new one, similar to a server side redirect.
+
+```tsx
+navigate("/some/route", { replace: true });
+```
+
+### Prevent Scroll Reset
+
+[modes: framework, data]
+
+To prevent `<ScrollRestoration>` from resetting the scroll position, use the `preventScrollReset` option.
+
+```tsx
+navigate("?some-tab=1", { preventScrollReset: true });
+```
+
+For example, if you have a tab interface connected to search params in the middle of a page and you don't want it to scroll to the top when a tab is clicked.
