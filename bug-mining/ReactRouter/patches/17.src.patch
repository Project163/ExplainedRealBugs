+# context.router {id=context.router}
+
+Every [`<Router>`](#router) puts a `router` object on [`context`](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/context.html). This object opens a channel of communication between e.g. a `<Router>` and its descendant `<Route>`s, `<Link>`s, and `<Prompt>`s, etc.
+
+While this interface is mainly for internal use, it can also occasionally be useful as public API. However, we encourage you to use it only as a last resort. Context itself is an experimental API and may break in a future release of React.
+
+It may be helpful to think of `context.router` as the merging together of two interfaces:
+
+  1. the [history](#history) object and
+  2. the [match](#match) object.
+
+Expressed in code, `context.router` would be
+
+```js
+context.router = {
+  ...history,
+  match
+}
+```
+
+Thus, the `router` object has all methods and properties of its underlying `history` instance (and updates in place the same as the `history` instance) with an additional `match` object that describes how the router matched the URL.
+
+Just as components are nested, `context.router` objects are nested and create a hierarchy. Each time you render a new `<Route>`, it shadows `context.router` to be the point of reference for all its descendants. This lets us express nested routes by simply nesting components.

+# history {id=history}
+
+The term "history" and "`history` object" in this documentation refers to [the `history` package](https://github.com/mjackson/history), which is one of only 2 major dependencies of React Router (besides React itself), and which provides several different implementations for managing session history in JavaScript in various environments.
+
+The following terms are also used:
+
+- "browser history" - A DOM-specific implementation, useful in web browsers that support the HTML5 history API
+- "hash history" - A DOM-specific implementation for legacy web browsers
+- "memory history" - An in-memory history implementation, useful in testing and non-DOM environments like React Native
+
+`history` objects typically have the following properties and methods:
+
+- `length` - (number) The number of entries in the history stack
+- `action` - (string) The current action (`PUSH`, `REPLACE`, or `POP`)
+- `location` - (object) The current location. May have the following properties:
+  - `pathname` - (string) The path of the URL
+  - `search` - (string) The URL query string
+  - `hash` - (string) The URL hash fragment

+# match {id=match}
+
+A `match` object contains information about how a `<Route path>` matched the URL. `match` objects may contain the following properties:
+
+  - `params` - (object) Key/value pairs parsed from the URL corresponding to the dynamic segments of the path
+  - `isExact` - `true` if the entire URL was matched (no trailing characters)
+  - `path` - (string) The path pattern used to match. Useful for building nested `<Route>`s
+  - `url` - (string) The matched portion of the URL. Useful for building nested `<Link>`s
+
+The majority of the time you can get a `match` object as a prop to your [`<Route component>`](#route.component) or in your [`<Route render>`](#route.render) callback, so you shouldn't need to manually generate them.
+
+However, you may find it useful to manually calculate the match if you have a pre-determined route config that you'd like to traverse in order to know which routes match. In that case, we also export our `matchPath` function so you can use it to match just like we do internally.
+
+```js
+import { matchPath } from 'react-router'
+
+const match = matchPath('/the/pathname', '/the/:dynamicId', {
+  exact: true,
+  strict: false
+})
+```
