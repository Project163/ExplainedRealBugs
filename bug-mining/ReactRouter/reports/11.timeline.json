#3889\n<br />\n<br />Previously, using a Link outside of the Router would break the program. The breaking was caused by the inability to find location when outside of the router context. This PR fixes that by checking if the context contains the router, and if not, marking \"isActive\" as false by default. This introduces the assumption that all <Links> outside of the router are not active.\n<br />\n<br />This also adds a warning to indicate that the user is using the <Link> is being used outside of the error. I am not exactly sure what copy to use in the error.\n<br />\n<br />As of right now, since there is no invariant in handleClick, a <Link> can be \"used\" outside of a router. It simply reloads the page based on the href.\n<br />\n<br />This is my first time contributing, so let me know if there is anything else that needs to be changed or added to resolve this issue.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/remix-run/react-router/issues/3896/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/remix-run/react-router/issues/3896/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/remix-run/react-router/issues/comments/247810998","html_url":"https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/issues/3889#issuecomment-247810998","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/remix-run/react-router/issues/3889","id":247810998,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI0NzgxMDk5OA==","user":{"login":"Connorelsea","id":1844458,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NDQ0NTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1844458?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Connorelsea","html_url":"https://github.com/Connorelsea","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Connorelsea/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Connorelsea/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Connorelsea/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Connorelsea/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Connorelsea/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Connorelsea/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Connorelsea/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Connorelsea/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Connorelsea/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-09-17T22:06:56Z","updated_at":"2016-09-17T22:06:56Z","body":"@timdorr I think I've got a good start on it here.

#3986 this is closer to working, but it fails in the `handleTransition` call which still requires a router.\n\nThere are two possible solutions:\n1) Add a check for the existence of `this.context.router` in `handleClick`. If this fails, then `event.preventDefault()` won't be called and the link will navigate naturally.\n2) Add a check for the existence of `this.context.router` in `handleTransition`. If this fails, use `window.location` to set the location to the `this.props.to` value.\n\nOption 1 seems better to me.\n\nWithout access to the router, the `<Link>`'s `to` prop will need to be a
