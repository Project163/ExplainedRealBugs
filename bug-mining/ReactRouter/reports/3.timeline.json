I think the `createElement` hook is what makes the middleware concept useful.\n\nIf you take a look at what I have in react-router-relay, it's a bit fiddly. I need to both set the default value for `createElement` at https://github.com/relay-tools/react-router-relay/blob/v0.11.0/src/RelayRouterContext.js#L22 and then make sure I'm calling into `this.props.createElement` in https://github.com/relay-tools/react-router-relay/blob/v0.11.0/src/RelayRouterContext.js#L46-L66. If I don't do this, then this wrapper won't compose properly.\n\nThere's also another problem with this approach of wrapping `createElement`. If you define things like:\n\n``` js\n<FooRootContainer>\n  <BarRootContainer>\n    <RouterContext />\n  </BarRootContainer>\n</FooRootContainer>\n```\n\nBecause of the way the wrapped `createElement` propagates down, when rendering route handlers, you get:\n\n``` js\n<BarRouteContainer>\n  <FooRouteContainer>\n    <RouteComponent />\n  </FooRouteContainer>\n</BarRouteContainer>\n```\n\nThis might not be a problem in practice, but it's a bit confusing and awkward.\n","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/remix-run/react-router/issues/comments/210163879/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"taion","id":3112159,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxMTIxNTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3112159?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/taion","html_url":"https://github.com/taion","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/taion/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/taion/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/taion/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/taion/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/taion/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/taion/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/taion/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/taion/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/taion/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/remix-run/react-router/issues/comments/210165822","html_url":"https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/issues/3316#issuecomment-210165822","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/remix-run/react-router/issues/3316","id":210165822,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIxMDE2NTgyMg==","user":{"login":"ryanflorence","id":100200,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMDIwMA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/100200?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanflorence","html_url":"https://github.com/ryanflorence","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanflorence/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanflorence/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanflorence/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanflorence/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanflorence/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanflorence/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanflorence/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanflorence/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanflorence/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-04-14T21:45:37Z","updated_at":"2016-04-14T21:53:27Z","body":"To
