We will do this by introducing new APIs before completely removing the old ones...\n\nBut the minor version deprecation notices seem a little funky to me. Why not just keep them to major versions? Everything working without warnings on 2.0 should work on 3.0. I think minor releases with warnings will put too much pressure on end-users.\n\nHere's my reasoning: npm installs with a default caret range, so many users will run into the deprecation warnings when doing an npm upgrade. It's perfectly fine to stick with router 2.0 (or any version) until the end of time if that's what works for you. The warnings are going to push users to upgrade something that is fine as-is. Old versions don't stop working, they just stop getting better. We've gotten critiques about this already.\n\nThat being said, I don't think we're going to have anywhere near as much API churn as we had with 2.0. I wouldn't be surprised if we have nothing to deprecate in near-term major release. So, this all may be moot.\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/remix-run/react-router/issues/comments/186433564/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"timdorr","id":17882,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3ODgy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17882?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/timdorr","html_url":"https://github.com/timdorr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timdorr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timdorr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timdorr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timdorr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timdorr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timdorr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timdorr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timdorr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timdorr/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/remix-run/react-router/issues/comments/186434049","html_url":"https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/issues/3102#issuecomment-186434049","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/remix-run/react-router/issues/3102","id":186434049,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE4NjQzNDA0OQ==","user":{"login":"taion","id":3112159,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxMTIxNTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3112159?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/taion","html_url":"https://github.com/taion","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/taion/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/taion/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/taion/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/taion/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/taion/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/taion/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/taion/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/taion/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/taion/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-02-19T22:26:38Z","updated_at":"2016-02-19T22:26:38Z","body":"If you don't introduce deprecations on minor releases, then you can't make actual breaking changes on actual major versions when needed – you end up being effectively forced to always have backward compat.
