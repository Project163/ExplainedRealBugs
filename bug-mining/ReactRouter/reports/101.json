At some point between version 6.2.1 and 6.9.0, both accepted a [URL object](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/URL/URL).  I found this convenient and assumed it was meant to be this way.\r\n\r\nI just upgraded to `react-router-dom@6.9.0` and was surprised to see that none of my `Link` components worked where I was passing a URL object as the `to` prop.  So I updated all the places this was happening to return a `url.toString()` version of that URL instead.  Then I was surprised to see that my `navigate` calls didn't work.\r\n\r\nMy URL objects previously had an origin, but `navigate` calls didn't try to concatenate that in the path.  For example, previously calling `navigate(url)` where `url.origin` was `https://example.com` didn't try to navigate to `https://example.com/https://example.com/some/path`.  Now, when I call `navigate(url.toString())` with that same URL object, I do see navigation to the unexpected path (`https://example.com/https://example.com/some/path`).\r\n\r\nI see that the [`useNavigate` docs](https://reactrouter.com/en/main/hooks/use-navigate) say that the `To` value is \"the same type as `<Link to>`\".  And then the [type declaration for `Link`](https://reactrouter.com/en/main/components/link) shows that the `To` type is `string | Partial<Path>`.  So this probably isn't really a doc issue and just user error.  But to be honest I don't know what a `Partial<Path>` is and maybe I read that and wrongly assumed that a `URL` object would work (and when it did I was happy).\r\n\r\nMaybe there is nothing to be done here, and I understand if this just gets closed.  If anything, maybe the docs could clarify what a `Partial<Path>` is (or say that a `URL` object cannot be used).\r\n\r\nThanks for your work on react-router and the nice docs.","closed_by":{"login":"timdorr","id":17882,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3ODgy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17882?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/timdorr","html_url":"https://github.com/timdorr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timdorr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timdorr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timdorr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timdorr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timdorr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timdorr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timdorr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timdorr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timdorr/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/remix-run/react-router/issues/10262/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/remix-run/react-router/issues/10262/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
