It renders {id}, type param is lost\r\n\r\n@otakustay This was an intentional breaking change in beta.5. Sorry I forgot to put it in the release notes for beta.5. I just added them.\r\n\r\nThe rationale is that we want to align `useParams()` more closely with the params you see in a given set of `<Routes>`. When you call `useParams()` in any route, you get the params available to that set of `<Routes>`. This should make it easier to predict which params you'll get back from `useParams()` and also makes it easier to avoid param name collisions with ancestor `<Routes>` elements that you (probably) can't see in the same file.\r\n\r\nIf you need the params from a parent set of `<Routes>`, we recommend you pass them along to the components that need them as props. I [forked your codesandbox](https://codesandbox.io/s/clever-wiles-ot549?file=/src/App.js) to show you how this is done.\r\n\r\nYou could also ofc create your own context object and merge all the params for your whole app together using whatever logic you'd like. In this case, it's your responsibility to make sure there are no param name collisions and that you always render your `<Routes>` inside ancestor `<Routes>` that have the params they need.\r\n\r\n```tsx\r\nconst AllParamsContext = React.createContext({});\r\n\r\nfunction AllParamsProvider({ children }) {\r\n  return <AllParamsContext.Provider value={useAllParams()} children={children} />;\r\n}\r\n\r\nfunction useAllParams() {\r\n  return {\r\n    // capture the params from all parent <Routes>\r\n    ...React.useContext(AllParamsContext),\r\n    // capture the params from this <Routes>\r\n    ...useParams()\r\n  };\r\n}\r\n\r\nfunction TopRoutes() {\r\n  return (\r\n    <AllParamsProvider>\r\n      <Routes>\r\n        <Route path=\":type/*\" element={<TypeRoute />} />\r\n      </Routes>\r\n    </AllParamsProvider>\r\n  );\r\n}\r\n\r\nfunction TypeRoute() {\r\n  return (\r\n    <AllParamsProvider>\r\n      <Routes>\r\n        <Route path=\":id\" element={<Page />} />\r\n      </Routes>\r\n    </AllParamsProvider>\r\n  );\r\n}\r\n\r\nfunction Page() {\r\n  let params = useAllParams();\r\n  // ...\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n@Avyiel It sounds like you may have a related problem, but it has to do with splat routes instead of params.
