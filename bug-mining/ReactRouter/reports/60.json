Using `react` `v15.6.2` and `react-router` `v5.1.1`\r\n2. **Production build (minified) with webpack v2 and Uglify** (not sure if pertinent to the issue but part of the setup I am using)\r\n3.

I am not sure exactly why that is the case. Our production build is targeting ES5.\r\n\r\nThis problem does not happen at all when we are on `v5.0.1` which we have been using for months. As a work around we have pinned our RR back to this version but could you please look into this as we would like to stay in sync with your latest releases.","closed_by":{"login":"mjackson","id":92839,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyODM5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/92839?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjackson","html_url":"https://github.com/mjackson","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjackson/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjackson/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjackson/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjackson/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjackson/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjackson/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjackson/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjackson/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjackson/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/remix-run/react-router/issues/6954/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/remix-run/react-router/issues/6954/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
