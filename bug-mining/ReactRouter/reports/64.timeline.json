appears that the compilePath function is at fault:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router/blob/262b45dd8d6cbdc3a984259c5591ffc3de80d600/packages/react-router/index.tsx#L999\r\n\r\n`<Route path=\"/app/*\" ... />` is compiling down to the RegExp match pattern: `^(/app)\\/?(.*)$`\r\n\r\nThis is causing `matchPath('/app/*', '/apples')` to match.\r\n\r\nIncidentally, this also means that `matchPath('/app', '/app?editing=true')` **doesn't** match which makes little sense as search params shouldn't affect whether a route is matched.\r\n\r\nThis seems (possibly??) only to apply to Routes at the \"root\" level and not descendant or nested routes.\r\n\r\nA more useful RegExp pattern for compilePath to resolve to in the case of `/app/*` would be `^(\\/app)(\\/.*|\\?.*)?$`\r\n\r\nI'm not familiar enough with the inner workings of compilePath to submit a PR but perhaps this help to isolate the problem.\r\n\r\nI, for one, am eagerly waiting for this to be fixed.","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/remix-run/react-router/issues/comments/698674552/reactions","total_count":10,"+1":10,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"huttonr","id":10057487,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMDU3NDg3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10057487?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/huttonr","html_url":"https://github.com/huttonr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huttonr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huttonr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huttonr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huttonr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huttonr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huttonr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huttonr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huttonr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huttonr/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"actor":{"login":"huttonr","id":10057487,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMDU3NDg3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10057487?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/huttonr","html_url":"https://github.com/huttonr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huttonr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huttonr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huttonr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huttonr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huttonr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huttonr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huttonr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huttonr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huttonr/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-09-25T18:35:51Z","updated_at":"2020-09-25T18:35:51Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/remix-run/react-router/issues/7517","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/remix-run/react-router","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/remix-run/react-router/issues/7517/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/remix-run/react-router/issues/7517/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/remix-run/react-router/issues/7517/events","html_url":"https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/issues/7517","id":665493378,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU2NjU0OTMzNzg=","number":7517,"title":"[v6]`matchPath`

Otherwise, please use the \"BUG REPORT\" template below.\r\n\r\nHave a feature request?\r\n=======================\r\nRemove the template from below and provide thoughtful commentary *and code samples* on what this feature means for your product. What will it allow you to do that you can't do today? How will it make current work-arounds straightforward? What potential bugs and edge cases does it help to avoid? etc. Please keep it product-centric.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<!-- BUG TEMPLATE -->\r\n\r\n## Version\r\n\r\n6.0.0-beta.0\r\n\r\n## Test Case\r\n\r\nhttps://codesandbox.io/s/react-router-v6-fhefl\r\n\r\n## Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\nIn the sandbox above, click on the `Apple` and `Applet` link.\r\n\r\n## Expected Behavior\r\n\r\nWhen I click on the `Applet` link, I hope it could redirect to `NotFoundPage`, not `ApplePage`.\r\n\r\n## Actual Behavior\r\n\r\nWhen I click on the `Applet` link, it redirects to `ApplePage`.

useMatch (\"/ about\") should be matched when the URL is /about, which works as well as version five, but behaves differently when it is useMatch (\"/ a / *\"). Surprisingly, it matches again!!\r\nI do not know if this is a bug or if useMatch is supposed to behave differently in version 6.\r\n\r\n### Actual Behavior\r\n\r\n Here is code sandbox for more
