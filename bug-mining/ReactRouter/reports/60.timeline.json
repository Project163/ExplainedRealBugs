We screwed up some of the dependency version selection in 4.3.1, which necessitated a major bump. See <a href=\"https://reacttraining.com/blog/react-router-v5/\" rel=\"nofollow\">this blog post</a> for details.</h4>\n<h3><g-emoji class=\"g-emoji\" alias=\"warning\" fallback-src=\"https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/26a0.png\">⚠️</g-emoji> Upgrade Warning <g-emoji class=\"g-emoji\" alias=\"warning\" fallback-src=\"https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/26a0.png\">⚠️</g-emoji></h3>\n<p>Please ensure you have upgraded both <code>react-router</code> and <code>react-router-dom</code> (<code>react-router-native</code> for RN users) to the <em>exact same</em> version.

We screwed up some of the dependency version selection in 4.3.1, which necessitated a major bump. See <a href=\"https://reacttraining.com/blog/react-router-v5/\" rel=\"nofollow\">this blog post</a> for details.</h4>\n<h3><g-emoji class=\"g-emoji\" alias=\"warning\" fallback-src=\"https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/26a0.png\">⚠️</g-emoji> Upgrade Warning <g-emoji class=\"g-emoji\" alias=\"warning\" fallback-src=\"https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/26a0.png\">⚠️</g-emoji></h3>\n<p>Please ensure you have upgraded both <code>react-router</code> and <code>react-router-dom</code> (<code>react-router-native</code> for RN users) to the <em>exact same</em> version. If different versions of those two packages are in your application, you will get errors when using <code>&lt;Link&gt;</code> and other <code>react-router-dom</code>-specific components. You can ensure you have the correct versions of both packages in your app using <code>npm ls react-router react-router-dom</code>.</p>\n<h2>Breaking Changes</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Since the old context API is no longer used, any access to the old context will fail.

We screwed up some of the dependency version selection in 4.3.1, which necessitated a major bump.

If different versions of those two packages are in your application, you will get errors when using <code>&lt;Link&gt;</code> and other <code>react-router-dom</code>-specific components. You can ensure you have the correct versions of both packages in your app using <code>npm ls react-router react-router-dom</code>.</p>\n<h2>Breaking Changes</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Since the old context API is no longer used, any access to the old context will fail.

We screwed up some of the dependency version selection in 4.3.1, which necessitated a major bump. See <a href=\"https://reacttraining.com/blog/react-router-v5/\" rel=\"nofollow\">this blog post</a> for details.</h4>\n<h3><g-emoji class=\"g-emoji\" alias=\"warning\" fallback-src=\"https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/26a0.png\">⚠️</g-emoji> Upgrade Warning <g-emoji class=\"g-emoji\" alias=\"warning\" fallback-src=\"https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/26a0.png\">⚠️</g-emoji></h3>\n<p>Please ensure you have upgraded both <code>react-router</code> and <code>react-router-dom</code> (<code>react-router-native</code> for RN users) to the <em>exact same</em> version. If different versions of those two packages are in your application, you will get errors when using <code>&lt;Link&gt;</code> and other <code>react-router-dom</code>-specific components. You can ensure you have the correct versions of both packages in your app using <code>npm ls react-router react-router-dom</code>.</p>\n<h2>Breaking Changes</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Since the old context API is no longer used, any access to the old context will fail. Use of the react router context is not supported, please use  <code>withRouter()</code> or a <code>&lt;Route/&gt;</code> instead.</li>\n<li>Due to the new context API, mixing of imports will now result in an exception:</li>\n</ul>\n<div class=\"highlight highlight-source-js-jsx\"><pre><span class=\"pl-c\"><span class=\"pl-c\">//</span> Be careful, this won't work anymore!</span>\n<span class=\"pl-k\">import</span> <span class=\"pl-smi\">BrowserRouter</span> <span class=\"pl-k\">from</span> <span class=\"pl-s\"><span class=\"pl-pds\">'</span>react-router-dom/BrowserRouter<span class=\"pl-pds\">'</span></span>;\n<span class=\"pl-k\">import</span> { <span class=\"pl-smi\">Route</span> } <span class=\"pl-k\">from</span> <span class=\"pl-s\"><span class=\"pl-pds\">'</span>react-router-dom<span class=\"pl-pds\">'</span></span>;\n\n&lt;<span class=\"pl-ent\">BrowserRouter</span>&gt;\n  &lt;<span class=\"pl-ent\">Route</span> /&gt;\n&lt;/<span class=\"pl-ent\">BrowserRouter</span>&gt;</pre></div>\n<p>Refactor as follows:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight highlight-source-js\"><pre><span class=\"pl-c\"><span class=\"pl-c\">//</span> These are both from the same build and use the same context object</span>\n<span class=\"pl-c\"><span class=\"pl-c\">//</span> so there won't be a mismatch :)</span>\n<span class=\"pl-k\">import</span> { <span class=\"pl-smi\">BrowserRouter</span>, <span class=\"pl-smi\">Route</span> } <span class=\"pl-k\">from</span> <span class=\"pl-s\"><span class=\"pl-pds\">'</span>react-router-dom<span class=\"pl-pds\">'</span></span>;</pre></div>\n<ul>\n<li>In development mode, we now throw an error when using 2 different builds (see <a class=\"commit-link\" data-hovercard-type=\"commit\" data-hovercard-url=\"https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router/commit/b2c6fa0725b7ff1ed762064d633b26b6293e0140/hovercard\" href=\"https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router/commit/b2c6fa0725b7ff1ed762064d633b26b6293e0140\"><tt>b2c6fa0</tt></a>), i.E. combining CJS imports with ESM imports.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>New Features</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><code>&lt;Route /&gt;</code> now supports an array of paths - <a class=\"issue-link js-issue-link\" data-error-text=\"Failed to load issue title\" data-id=\"290216250\" data-permission-text=\"Issue title is private\" data-url=\"https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router/issues/5889\" data-hovercard-type=\"pull_request\" data-hovercard-url=\"/ReactTraining/react-router/pull/5889/hovercard\" href=\"https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router/pull/5889\">#5889</a> (thanks <a class=\"user-mention\" data-hovercard-type=\"user\" data-hovercard-url=\"/hovercards?user_id=10580994\" data-octo-click=\"hovercard-link-click\" data-octo-dimensions=\"link_type:self\" href=\"https://github.com/baronswindle\">@baronswindle</a>)</li>\n</ul>\n<div class=\"highlight highlight-source-js-jsx\"><pre>&lt;<span class=\"pl-ent\">Route</span> <span class=\"pl-e\">path</span><span class=\"pl-k\">=</span><span class=\"pl-pse\">{</span>[<span class=\"pl-s\"><span class=\"pl-pds\">\"</span>/BigApple<span class=\"pl-pds\">\"</span></span>, <span class=\"pl-s\"><span class=\"pl-pds\">\"</span>/NYC<span class=\"pl-pds\">\"</span></span>, <span class=\"pl-s\"><span class=\"pl-pds\">\"</span>NewYork<span class=\"pl-pds\">\"</span></span>]<span class=\"pl-pse\">}</span> <span class=\"pl-e\">component</span><span class=\"pl-k\">=</span><span class=\"pl-pse\">{</span><span class=\"pl-smi\">NewYork</span><span class=\"pl-pse\">}</span> /&gt;</pre></div>\n<h2><a href=\"https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router/compare/v4.3.1...v5.0.0\">Full Changelog</a></h2>\n<ul>\n<li><code>&lt;Route /&gt;</code> now supports multiple child nodes when using react &gt;= 16.0.</li>\n<li>Migrated to new react context API, with a polyfill for react versions &lt; 16.2</li>\n<li>Removed deprecated lifecycle methods <code>componentWillMount</code> and <code>componentWillReceiveProps</code></li>\n<li>Introduced more warnings in development builds</li>\n<li>Changed build-process to rollup:\n<ul>\n<li>Smaller build size</li>\n<li>Package now includes pre-minified files</li>\n<li>Package now consists of single-file builds that include all modules.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Upgraded to history 4.9.0</li>\n<li>Per file imports are deprecated and will be removed in a future major version.
