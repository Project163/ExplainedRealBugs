Since we're planning on exposing `this.context.router` as a first-class API (as we did in previous versions), I'd like to do a bit more bikeshedding here before we call it good and document it.\r\n\r\nIMO, the best high-level API would be to have the router act exactly like a history object, but with an extra `match` property. So, for example:\r\n\r\n```\r\ncontext.router = {\r\n  ...history,\r\n  match: {\r\n    params: ...,\r\n    isExact: ...,\r\n    path: ...,\r\n    url: ...\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nFrom an implementation perspective, this will be a little tricky because we're using subscriptions to communicate state changes down the hierarchy, so we'll need to update the actual router object in place. But I believe it's possible.","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/remix-run/react-router/issues/comments/274286037/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"mjackson","id":92839,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyODM5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/92839?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjackson","html_url":"https://github.com/mjackson","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjackson/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjackson/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjackson/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjackson/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjackson/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjackson/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjackson/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjackson/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjackson/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"actor":{"login":"pshrmn","id":1127037,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMjcwMzc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1127037?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pshrmn","html_url":"https://github.com/pshrmn","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pshrmn/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pshrmn/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pshrmn/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pshrmn/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pshrmn/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pshrmn/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pshrmn/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pshrmn/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pshrmn/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-01-23T15:23:34Z","updated_at":"2017-01-23T15:23:34Z","source":{"type":"issue","issue":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/remix-run/react-router/issues/4351","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/remix-run/react-router","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/remix-run/react-router/issues/4351/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/remix-run/react-router/issues/4351/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/remix-run/react-router/issues/4351/events","html_url":"https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/issues/4351","id":201677146,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWUyMDE2NzcxNDY=","number":4351,"title":"Animating

with `<Switch>` is a little bit confusing. The goal is to animate the entering and leaving `<Route>`s, but what you have to do is animate the `<Switch>`. Unfortunately, when a `<Switch>` is rendered, it grabs the most current `history.location.pathname`. This means that both entering and exiting `<Switch>`es are choosing which `<Route>` to render based on the current location. I was able to get around that by adding a `pathname` prop to `<Switch>`, which will prefer that over grabbing the current `history.location.pathname`.\r\n\r\n```js\r\nconst Routes = withRouter(({
