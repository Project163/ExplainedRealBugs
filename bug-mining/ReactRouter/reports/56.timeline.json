If I remove the `withRouter` wrapper and use the `Text` component directly, then the component doesn't receive the `match` prop whether or not it's used inside a `<NavLink>`.\r\n\r\n\r\nFor some context around why this is an issue and how I ran into it, the real-world use case is for some internationalization code I'm writing. The code works by wrapping a component with `withRouter` and using the `match.params.locale` to render different text.\r\n\r\n```react\r\n<div>\r\n  <div>\r\n    <I18n t=\"information\" />\r\n  </div>\r\n  <div>\r\n    <I18n t=\"description\" />\r\n  </div>\r\n  <Link to=\"/about\">\r\n    <I18n t=\"about\" />\r\n  </Link>\r\n</div>\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe code was working as expected until I turned the `Link` into `NavLink`:\r\n\r\n```react\r\n<NavLink to=\"/about\">\r\n  <I18n t=\"about\" />\r\n</NavLink>\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen I did this, `match.params.locale` was no longer passed in to the wrapped component (even though it works with a regular `Link`). For my particular use case, the workaround I used was writing my own `NavLink` component from scratch, but I still think this behavior is a bug. I would expect wrapped components to work the same in `NavLink` and `Link`.\r\n","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/remix-run/react-router/issues/comments/469753809/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"zfletch","id":3039310,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwMzkzMTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3039310?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zfletch","html_url":"https://github.com/zfletch","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zfletch/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zfletch/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zfletch/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zfletch/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zfletch/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zfletch/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zfletch/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zfletch/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zfletch/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/remix-run/react-router/issues/comments/469769347","html_url":"https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/issues/6613#issuecomment-469769347","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/remix-run/react-router/issues/6613","id":469769347,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ2OTc2OTM0Nw==","user":{"login":"pshrmn","id":1127037,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMjcwMzc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1127037?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pshrmn","html_url":"https://github.com/pshrmn","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pshrmn/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pshrmn/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pshrmn/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pshrmn/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pshrmn/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pshrmn/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pshrmn/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pshrmn/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pshrmn/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-03-05T17:16:32Z","updated_at":"2019-03-05T17:16:32Z","body":"@zfletch

I originally stumbled on this bit in ```Route```:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nconst match = this.props.computedMatch\r\n  ? this.props.computedMatch // <Switch> already computed the match for us\r\n  : this.props.path\r\n    ? matchPath(location.pathname, this.props)\r\n    : context.match;\r\n```\r\n\r\nHere, match gets reassigned to ```matchPath(location.pathname, this.props)``` and is null afterwards for the rest of the chain.\r\n\r\nThe matchPath call looks like this:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nmatchPath(\"/person/foo\", { path: \\\\/person\\\\/1, exact: undefined, strict: undefined, location: undefined });\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe culprit is NavLink. That component overwrites the path-prop of route with an escaped version of the \"to\"-prop (in this example \"/person/1\").  That re-assigned path-prop then gets passed down the chain and causes the last match provided by withRouter() to be null.","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/remix-run/react-router/issues/comments/472109397/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"StringEpsilon","id":5951778,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5NTE3Nzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5951778?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/StringEpsilon","html_url":"https://github.com/StringEpsilon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StringEpsilon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StringEpsilon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StringEpsilon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StringEpsilon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StringEpsilon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StringEpsilon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StringEpsilon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StringEpsilon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StringEpsilon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/remix-run/react-router/issues/comments/472118323","html_url":"https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/issues/6613#issuecomment-472118323","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/remix-run/react-router/issues/6613","id":472118323,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ3MjExODMyMw==","user":{"login":"StringEpsilon","id":5951778,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5NTE3Nzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5951778?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/StringEpsilon","html_url":"https://github.com/StringEpsilon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StringEpsilon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StringEpsilon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StringEpsilon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StringEpsilon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StringEpsilon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StringEpsilon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StringEpsilon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StringEpsilon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StringEpsilon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2019-03-12T18:08:49Z","updated_at":"2019-03-12T18:09:19Z","body":"A fix would be to forgoe using the match provided by Route in NavLink and instead call matchPath() there directly.\r\n\r\nSomething like this: (Snippet)\r\n\r\n```js\r\n// NavLink render():\r\n<Route\r\n  location={location}\r\n  children={({ location }) => {\r\n    const match = location.pathname && escapedPath ?\r\n      matchPath(location.pathname, { path: escapedPath, exact, strict}):\r\n      null;\r\n    const isActive = !!(isActiveProp\r\n      ? isActiveProp(match, location)\r\n      : match);\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut I'm not entirely sure if that is a viable solution.
