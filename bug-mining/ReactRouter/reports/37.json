Doing a named import instead - `import { createBrowserHistory as createHistory } from 'history';` - seems to work better (though it looks like history doesn't re-export everything RR needs ATM). \r\n\r\nI'm not sure if this is a webpack bug or an RR but figured I'd log it here first.\r\n\r\n## Expected Behavior\r\nShould get just the ESM files in the bundle.\r\n\r\n## Actual Behavior\r\nSee above.","closed_by":{"login":"timdorr","id":17882,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3ODgy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17882?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/timdorr","html_url":"https://github.com/timdorr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timdorr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timdorr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timdorr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timdorr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timdorr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timdorr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timdorr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timdorr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timdorr/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/remix-run/react-router/issues/5576/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/remix-run/react-router/issues/5576/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
