This format is not well-suited for Q&A, and questions here don't have as much visibility as they do elsewhere. Before you ask a question, here are some resources to get help first:\r\n\r\n- Do the tutorial: https://github.com/reactjs/react-router-tutorial\r\n- Read the docs: https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router/tree/latest/docs\r\n- Explore examples: https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router/tree/latest/examples\r\n- Look for/ask questions on stack overflow: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/ask?tags=react-router\r\n- Ask in chat: https://discord.gg/0ZcbPKXt5bYaNQ46\r\n\r\n\r\nThink you found a bug?\r\n======================\r\nThe best bug report is a failing test in the repository as a pull request. Otherwise, please use the \"BUG REPORT\" template below.\r\n\r\n\r\nHave a feature request?\r\n=======================\r\nRemove the template from below and provide thoughtful commentary *and code samples* on what this feature means for your product. What will it allow you to do that you can't do today? How will it make current work-arounds straightforward? What potential bugs and edge cases does it help to avoid? etc. Please keep it product-centric.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<!-- BUG TEMPLATE -->\r\n## Version\r\n3.0.0\r\n\r\n## Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\nuse `withRouter` without a Router ;) (Rendering stuff in styleguidist)\r\n`this.props.router` is used only in action handlers \r\n\r\n## Expected Behavior\r\n\r\nThe component should at least render.\r\n\r\n## Actual Behavior\r\n\r\nGet an error message:\r\n\r\n`TypeError: Cannot read property 'params' of undefined` \r\n\r\nUnfortunately, I am unable to debug in styleguidist quickly, but I think the error is coming from here: \r\nhttps://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router/blob/6eeb7ad358f987520f5b519e48bdd31f725cbade/modules/withRouter.js#L32\r\n\r\nMaybe a quick and dirty fix on Line 31 would be enough:\r\n\r\n`const router = this.props.router || this.context.router || {}`\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"timdorr","id":17882,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3ODgy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17882?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/timdorr","html_url":"https://github.com/timdorr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timdorr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timdorr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timdorr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timdorr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timdorr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timdorr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timdorr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timdorr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timdorr/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/remix-run/react-router/issues/4292/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/remix-run/react-router/issues/4292/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
