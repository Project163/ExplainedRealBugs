miss.</div>\r\n)}>\r\n\r\n<Route path=\"/foo\" render={() => (\r\n  <div>Render only renders if there's a match, null if miss</div>\r\n)}>\r\n```\r\n\r\n## The API isn't instructive\r\n\r\nThe API is not instructive of behavior at all: \"render\" doesn't indicate \"only renders when there's a match\" and children doesn't indicate anything either.\r\n\r\nMaybe we can ditch having two render props

API</div>\r\n)}/>\r\n```\r\n\r\nI'm pretty convinced this is a good way forward. Route has two types of props:\r\n\r\n- How should I match? (`path`, `exact`, `strict`)\r\n- How should I render? (`render`, `children`, `component`)\r\n\r\nIt’s a bit conflated that the distinction between `render` and `children` is how things match!\r\n\r\n## Component prop\r\n\r\nAlso, with this change the `component` prop can participate in use-cases where you want to render even when there's no match. Today you have to use the `children` prop.\r\n\r\n```jsx\r\n<Route children={(props) => <OtherThing {...props} />}/>\r\n// becomes this when the use case for the route changes:\r\n<Route alwaysRender={true} component={OtherThing}/>\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Bikeshedding on the name of the prop\r\n\r\n```jsx\r\n<Route alwaysRender={false} render={() => ()}/>\r\n<Route renderOnMiss={false} render={() => ()}/>\r\n<Route renderOnMatchOnly={true} render={() => ()}/>\r\n<Route renderOn={\"match\" || \"miss\" || \"both\"} render={() => ()}/>\r\n<Route ignoreMatch={false} render={() => ()}/>\r\n```\r\n\r\nThoughts?\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/remix-run/react-router/issues/5583/reactions","total_count":35,"+1":34,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":1,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/remix-run/react-router/issues/5583/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/remix-run/react-router/issues/comments/425789666","html_url":"https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/issues/6362#issuecomment-425789666","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/remix-run/react-router/issues/6362","id":425789666,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQyNTc4OTY2Ng==","user":{"login":"bradwestfall","id":2272118,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNzIxMTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2272118?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bradwestfall","html_url":"https://github.com/bradwestfall","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bradwestfall/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bradwestfall/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bradwestfall/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bradwestfall/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bradwestfall/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bradwestfall/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bradwestfall/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bradwestfall/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bradwestfall/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-10-01T04:58:59Z","updated_at":"2018-10-01T04:58:59Z","body":"If the eventual plan is that `<Route render>` and `<Route children>` are effectively the same and you'll be removing one (because of the smaller API), my vote is to remove `<Route children>` because it's probably the one of the two used the least now (so this will require less updates for people using RR), plus, this is just a personal preference, but I like render props with an actual `render` prop over using children as a render prop.
