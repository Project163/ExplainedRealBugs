This issue gives a more convincing argument for re-adding the `as` prop. I'm still rendering a totally accessible `<a>` link to the DOM, my wrapper component just adds some extra classes to style it. The same applies to the `style`, `target=\"_blank\"`, etc. props.\r\n\r\nIn my case, I cannot directly modify the `Link` component I'm passing to the `as` prop as it's provided by an external library. Yes, I can create _yet another_ Link wrapper that uses `useHref` and `useNavigate`, but imo 1. it's not scalable to large codebases with multiple link styles and 2. relies on react-router users making the Link component accessible when react-router already does a great job at

However, while inspecting https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router/blob/dev-experimental/packages/react-router-dom/index.tsx#L235 I noticed the `handleClick` function. Is passing that function as the `onClick` handler to the built component from `component`/`as` an option? I think that would hide the implementation details (the `CustomLink` doesn't know what the `onClick` function does, only ensures it's passed to the final DOM rendered component). This approach doesn't require passing the `navigate` prop (which may be a downside to some? if so, how?). My rationale is that a `CustomLink` passed as the `component` prop to a `Link` should only modify its aesthetics, not its

PR adds two new APIs that simplify the creation of custom `Link` components:\r\n\r\n- `useLinkClickHandler` for `react-router-dom`\r\n- `useLinkPressHandler` for `react-router-native`\r\n\r\nThe idea is the same for each. There is a lot of logic in our `onClick` handler for the DOM link, and this hook provides a simple wrapper that consumers can use to capture all of that logic while customizing other aspects of rendering.\r\n\r\n```tsx\r\nimport { useHref, useLinkClickHandler } from \"react-router-dom\";\r\nimport { styled } from \"styled-components\"; // could be whatever\r\n\r\nconst StyledLink = styled.a`\r\n  color: fuschia;\r\n`;\r\n\r\nconst Link = React.forwardRef(\r\n  ({ onClick, replace = false, state, target, to, ...rest }, ref) => {\r\n    let href = useHref(to);\r\n    let handleClick = useLinkClickHandler(to, { replace, state, target });\r\n\r\n    return (\r\n      <StyledLink\r\n        {...rest}\r\n        href={href}\r\n        onClick={event => {\r\n          onClick?.(event);\r\n          if (!event.defaultPrevented) {\r\n            handleClick(event);\r\n          }\r\n        }}\r\n        ref={ref}\r\n        target={target}\r\n      />\r\n    );\r\n  }\r\n);\r\n```\r\n\r\nThough the internals of `Link` in `react-router-native` are much simpler, I added the hook there for feature parity between the two packages.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/remix-run/react-router/issues/7998/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/remix-run/react-router/issues/7998/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":5254824091,"node_id":"REFE_lADOAS86yM4pVrHuzwAAAAE5NkCb","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/remix-run/react-router/issues/events/5254824091","actor":{"login":"chaance","id":3082153,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwODIxNTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3082153?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chaance","html_url":"https://github.com/chaance","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chaance/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chaance/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chaance/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chaance/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chaance/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chaance/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chaance/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chaance/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chaance/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"a5583ba41517c09a7beae78c037e1c5d8e2a8fef","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/remix-run/react-router/commits/a5583ba41517c09a7beae78c037e1c5d8e2a8fef","created_at":"2021-09-03T17:51:33Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":5254825924,"node_id":"CE_lADOAS86yM4pVrHuzwAAAAE5NkfE","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/remix-run/react-router/issues/events/5254825924","actor":{"login":"chaance","id":3082153,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwODIxNTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3082153?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chaance","html_url":"https://github.com/chaance","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chaance/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chaance/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chaance/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chaance/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chaance/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chaance/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chaance/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chaance/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chaance/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-09-03T17:52:01Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}]
