Second, I personally think that absolute URLs are easier to maintain and are much clearer when reading the code.

Which by default is false, resulting in the behavior as you described. But if you know what you are doing and you have a more complex routing setup the `path` can be treated as an absolute path like it worked in previous versions. That way you don't have to deal with certain \"meanings\" in the path prop like a `/` or a `.` and it's easier to see what's going on.","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/remix-run/react-router/issues/comments/640185204/reactions","total_count":7,"+1":7,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"robertvansteen","id":14931924,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0OTMxOTI0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14931924?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertvansteen","html_url":"https://github.com/robertvansteen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertvansteen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertvansteen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertvansteen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertvansteen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertvansteen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertvansteen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertvansteen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertvansteen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robertvansteen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/remix-run/react-router/issues/comments/640267090","html_url":"https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/issues/7335#issuecomment-640267090","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/remix-run/react-router/issues/7335","id":640267090,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY0MDI2NzA5MA==","user":{"login":"smashercosmo","id":273283,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3MzI4Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/273283?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/smashercosmo","html_url":"https://github.com/smashercosmo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smashercosmo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smashercosmo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smashercosmo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smashercosmo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smashercosmo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smashercosmo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smashercosmo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smashercosmo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smashercosmo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-06-07T19:24:32Z","updated_at":"2020-06-07T19:25:22Z","body":"> One case that I think will be very confusing for people is with path=\"/\" for \"index\" routes.

Path, that starts with forward slash, always indicates that this is a root path.

I agree. At least how I'm thinking about it is that the trailing `/`, similar to `*`, is just a react-router specific configuration expression. \r\n\r\nI therefore don't try to configure my 'root' components with actual paths from my `paths` constant, I just hard code them into the Routes like `<Route path=\"/\" ...`, just as I hard code `*` chars like `<Route path={paths.something.base + '/*'}...` - I want to keep these 'special characters' out of my actual path definitions, only using them in the react-router Route definitions.\r\n\r\nWhat's confusing is that, unlike `*`, `/` looks like a legit part of an actual path and appears inconsistent. I.e. why does the root path have a leading `/` but no other sub paths do?\r\n\r\nI agree that a good way to solve this might be to make this 'root' special char something different, something more obviously a special char, like `.` as you suggest.\r\n\r\nWeirdly though, to sidestep this completely, playing around I've noticed that in fact both leaving `path` out and setting `path=\"\"` also seem to work for a root - [see here](https://codesandbox.io/s/elastic-wave-zos64) - @mjackson I'm not sure if this is intended behaviour but if so these could also work as pretty decent
