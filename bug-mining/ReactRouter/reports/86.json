It seems anyway that a `<Navigate>` element can't be used directly inside a `<Routes>` element—whereas a similar behaviour was possible in V5 using `<Switch>`/`<Redirect>`.\r\n\r\nIs the code below the recommended way to go to mimic the old behaviour?\r\n```\r\n<Route element={<Navigate to=\"/dashboard\" />} index /> // index can be replaced with path=\"/anything\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf yes, it'd be worth mentioning that in the v5-to-v6 migration doc. I can prepare a PR if needed.","closed_by":{"login":"mjackson","id":92839,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyODM5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/92839?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjackson","html_url":"https://github.com/mjackson","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjackson/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjackson/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjackson/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjackson/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjackson/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjackson/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjackson/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjackson/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjackson/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/remix-run/react-router/issues/8181/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/remix-run/react-router/issues/8181/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
