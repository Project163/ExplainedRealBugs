Version\r\n\r\nv5.1.1\r\n\r\n## Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\n1. Using `react` `v15.6.2` and `react-router` `v5.1.1`\r\n2. **Production build (minified) with webpack v2 and Uglify** (not sure if pertinent to the issue but part of the setup I am using)\r\n3. Create a component that renders with:\r\n\r\n```\r\n<div>\r\n  <Link to={`/watch=${someVar}`}>Direct Link{</Link>\r\n</div>\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Expected Behavior\r\n\r\nNo errors.\r\n\r\n## Actual Behavior\r\n\r\nConsole will show:\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1777724/65884167-58f2fe80-e366-11e9-991a-d5d5542b0384.png)\r\n\r\nhttps://reactjs.org/docs/error-decoder.html/?invariant=119\r\n\r\nNote, the problem doesn't seem to happen when we are doing a development build where nothing is minified. I am not sure exactly why that is the case. Our production build is targeting ES5.\r\n\r\nThis problem does not happen at all when we are on `v5.0.1` which we have been using for months. As a work around we have pinned our RR back to this version but could you please look into this as we would like to stay in sync with your latest
