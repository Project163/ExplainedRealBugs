The following code works on 6.0.0-beta.4, but not 6.0.0-beta.5.\r\n\r\n```JSX\r\nimport React from 'react'\r\nimport ReactDOM from 'react-dom'\r\nimport { BrowserRouter, Routes, Route, Navigate, Outlet } from 'react-router-dom'\r\n\r\nconst ContentRoutes = (): JSX.Element => (\r\n  <Routes>\r\n    <Route index element={<Navigate to='%2F' replace />} />\r\n    <Route path=':id' element={<h3>got a match!</h3>} />\r\n  </Routes>\r\n)\r\n\r\nconst App = (): JSX.Element => (\r\n  <BrowserRouter>\r\n    <Routes>\r\n      <Route path='/' element={<><h1>App Layout</h1><Outlet /></>}>\r\n        <Route index element={<Navigate to='content' replace />} />\r\n        <Route path='content/*' element={<ContentRoutes />} />\r\n        <Route path='*' element={<h2>Not Found</h2>} />\r\n      </Route>\r\n    </Routes>\r\n  </BrowserRouter>\r\n)\r\n\r\nReactDOM.render(\r\n  <React.StrictMode>\r\n    <App />\r\n  </React.StrictMode>,\r\n  document.getElementById('root')\r\n)\r\n\r\n```\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nUpon load, the page should redirect to `/content` and then `/content/%2F`, and then display the text `<h3>got a match!</h3>`. This works under 6.0.0-beta.4.\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nOn 6.0.0-beta.5, the redirects work but the text `<h3>got a match!</h3>` is not displayed.","closed_by":{"login":"mjackson","id":92839,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyODM5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/92839?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjackson","html_url":"https://github.com/mjackson","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjackson/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjackson/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjackson/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjackson/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjackson/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjackson/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjackson/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjackson/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjackson/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/remix-run/react-router/issues/8072/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/remix-run/react-router/issues/8072/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
