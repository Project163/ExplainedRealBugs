The goal is to animate the entering and leaving `<Route>`s, but what you have to do is animate the `<Switch>`. Unfortunately, when a `<Switch>` is rendered, it grabs the most current `history.location.pathname`. This means that both entering and exiting `<Switch>`es are choosing which `<Route>` to render based on the current location. I was able to get around that by adding a `pathname` prop to `<Switch>`, which will prefer that over grabbing the current `history.location.pathname`.\r\n\r\n```js\r\nconst Routes = withRouter(({ history }) => (\r\n  <CSSTransitionGroup\r\n    transitionName='fade'\r\n    transitionEnterTimeout={500}\r\n    transitionLeaveTimeout={500}\r\n    >\r\n    <Switch key={history.location.pathname} pathname={history.location.pathname}>\r\n      <Route path=\"/red\" render={Red} />\r\n      <Route path=\"/green\" render={Green} />\r\n      <Route path=\"/blue\" render={Blue} />\r\n    </Switch>\r\n  </CSSTransitionGroup>\r\n))\r\n```","closed_by":{"login":"ryanflorence","id":100200,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMDIwMA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/100200?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanflorence","html_url":"https://github.com/ryanflorence","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanflorence/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanflorence/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanflorence/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanflorence/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanflorence/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanflorence/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanflorence/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanflorence/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanflorence/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/remix-run/react-router/issues/4351/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/remix-run/react-router/issues/4351/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
