reduces the size of `common.js` from 797 kB to 791 kB by using the ES module builds of `react-router-dom` and `history`.\r\n\r\nI tested, and there is no benefit to deep-linking `react-router-dom` because it exports a `\"module\"`, which appears to do tree-shaking correctly in Webpack. Plus, to deep-link the ES modules as opposed to the CJS modules, we would need to import e.g. `'react-router-dom/es/Route'` instead of `'react-router-dom/Route'`. So I use `import { Route } from 'react-router-dom'` which is terser and has the same effect.\r\n\r\nOTOH there is a bug currently in `react-router-dom` where it double-imports `history`'s CJS and ES build (https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router/issues/5576). So to work around that, we can just use `NormalModuleReplacementPlugin` for now.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mastodon/mastodon/issues/5264/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mastodon/mastodon/issues/5264/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/remix-run/react-router/issues/comments/338150863","html_url":"https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/issues/5576#issuecomment-338150863","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/remix-run/react-router/issues/5576","id":338150863,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDMzODE1MDg2Mw==","user":{"login":"nikarh","id":5517011,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MTcwMTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5517011?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nikarh","html_url":"https://github.com/nikarh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nikarh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nikarh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nikarh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nikarh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nikarh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nikarh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nikarh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nikarh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nikarh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-10-20T09:08:34Z","updated_at":"2017-10-20T09:17:17Z","body":"As far as I can tell, `react-router` imports history in two ways, first one:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nimport { createLocation, locationsAreEqual } from 'history';\r\n```\r\nSince `history` module has a `\"module\": \"es/index.js\"` key in `package.json` webpack resolves it to `history/es/index.js`.\r\n\r\nThe second is\r\n```js\r\nimport createHistory from 'history/createMemoryHistory';\r\n```\r\nAccording to the [modules proposal](https://github.com/dherman/defense-of-dot-js/blob/master/proposal.md), `history` package doesn't have a `\"modules.root\"` key in package.json, thus webpack doesn't translate this import to `history/es/createMemoryHistory`.\r\n\r\nI think the most obvious solution here would be a PR to a `history` project with `modules.root`,\r\nbut for now you can alias specific imports used by `react-router` in webpack config:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nresolve: {\r\n    alias: {\r\n      'history/createMemoryHistory':\r\n        path.resolve(__dirname, 'node_modules/history/es/createMemoryHistory'),\r\n      'history/createHashHistory':\r\n        path.resolve(__dirname, 'node_modules/history/es/createHashHistory'),\r\n      'history/createBrowserHistory':\r\n        path.resolve(__dirname, 'node_modules/history/es/createBrowserHistory'),\r\n      'history/PathUtils':\r\n        path.resolve(__dirname,

different ways that things are being imported from history:\r\n\r\n* Deep imports like `require('history/createBrowserHistory')`\r\n* Direct imports like `require('history')`\r\n\r\nThe former type of import is bringing in JS modules in the root of `node_modules/history`, but the latter type is causing `node_modules/es/index.js` and its dependencies to be brought in due to the `\"main\"` entry point in its package.json.\r\n\r\nIn theory changing the imports to be consistent will avoid bundling all the files in both `node_modules/history` and `node_modules/history/es`.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/remix-run/react-router/issues/5971/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/remix-run/react-router/issues/5971/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/remix-run/react-router/issues/comments/368606105","html_url":"https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/issues/5576#issuecomment-368606105","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/remix-run/react-router/issues/5576","id":368606105,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDM2ODYwNjEwNQ==","user":{"login":"DullReferenceException","id":4923668,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5MjM2Njg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4923668?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/DullReferenceException","html_url":"https://github.com/DullReferenceException","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DullReferenceException/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DullReferenceException/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DullReferenceException/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DullReferenceException/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DullReferenceException/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DullReferenceException/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DullReferenceException/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DullReferenceException/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DullReferenceException/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2018-02-26T18:47:34Z","updated_at":"2018-02-26T18:47:34Z","body":"I
