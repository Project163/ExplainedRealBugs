Just spent the last few hours toying around and converting a few things. Made so many things so much easier!\r\n\r\nTwo things as I was messing around and looking through the code:\r\n\r\n1. The <Link> component's \"to\" prop seems different? Instead passing an object like this\r\n`props={pathname:  '/home', state: {cool: true}} <Link to={props}>Link</Link>`\r\nI have to do this:\r\n         `props={to:  '/home', state: {cool: true}} <Link {...props}>Link</Link>`\r\n\r\n2. It seems like the \"location\" prop from the Switch component is gone with Routes. If so, how would I implement a pattern like this?\r\nhttps://reacttraining.com/react-router/web/example/modal-gallery","closed_by":{"login":"chaance","id":3082153,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwODIxNTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3082153?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chaance","html_url":"https://github.com/chaance","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chaance/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chaance/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chaance/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chaance/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chaance/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chaance/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chaance/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chaance/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chaance/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/remix-run/react-router/issues/7117/reactions","total_count":14,"+1":14,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/remix-run/react-router/issues/7117/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
