a side note**, I had a lot of errors while trying to run the website locally. seems like most of the paths to the modules in `react-router-dom` are off. \r\nThey are targeting to the root of `react-router-dom` instead to `react-router-dom/modules`\r\n\r\nJust to name a few: [ReactRouterDOMShim](https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router/blob/master/website/modules/ReactRouterDOMShim.js#L16), [generatePath](https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router/blob/master/packages/react-router-dom/modules/generatePath.js#L2), [MemoryRouter](https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router/blob/master/packages/react-router-dom/modules/MemoryRouter.js#L2) and the list goes on...\r\n\r\nI guess this should be on a different issue then.\r\n\r\nHope I helped :wink:

created an un-minified webpack build to try and figure out what is going on here (see attached) 🕵️\r\n\r\nIt looks like our bundle includes a `process` shim which is preventing `process.env.NODE_ENV` from being evaluated properly at build time, so the debugging code with the `_debugID` isn't being stripped out.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"687\" alt=\"screen shot 2018-04-24 at 9 25 36 am\"

the Animated code isn't an actual dependency (it's just copied over from an older version of the library) 🙃\r\n\r\nFor example, you can see here that entry # 463 in the outer bundle actually exports a webpack bundle of the Animated library:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"639\" alt=\"screen shot 2018-04-24 at 9 28 06 am\"

out of it so the webpack `DefinePlugin` can do its job and replace all the `process.env.NODE_ENV` references or b) figure out which commit (`git bisect`, anyone?) caused this weird behavior and undo the regression.\r\n\r\nI've uploaded my build here in case anyone would like to go poking

there! This is my first pull request to your repository. It updates the Animated component library in the website directory to the newest version (as seen here: https://github.com/animatedjs/animated), in order to fix an error on the mobile browser. \r\n\r\nThe Animated library was using some undocumented internals of React that appear to have been changed in the new version, causing weird exceptions deep in the Animated code. I would recommend testing this solution as I was unable to find any test files for the website, and I also had to make some local modifications to get the app running on my Windows machine (not committed!).\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\ntdurtschi","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/remix-run/react-router/issues/6369/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/remix-run/react-router/issues/6369/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":1894084572,"node_id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MTg5NDA4NDU3Mg==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/remix-run/react-router/issues/events/1894084572","actor":{"login":"mjackson","id":92839,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyODM5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/92839?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjackson","html_url":"https://github.com/mjackson","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjackson/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjackson/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjackson/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjackson/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjackson/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjackson/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjackson/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjackson/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjackson/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"closed","commit_id":"5345a820818c8d43ac923558670538a479ac2234","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/remix-run/react-router/commits/5345a820818c8d43ac923558670538a479ac2234","created_at":"2018-10-09T22:10:08Z","state_reason":null,"performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":2014162283,"node_id":"MDExOkxvY2tlZEV2ZW50MjAxNDE2MjI4Mw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/remix-run/react-router/issues/events/2014162283","actor":{"login":"lock[bot]","id":33595554,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90MzM1OTU1NTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/6672?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lock%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/lock","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lock%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lock%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lock%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lock%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lock%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lock%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lock%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lock%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lock%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"locked","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2018-12-08T22:26:16Z","lock_reason":"resolved","performed_via_github_app":null}]
