@smkamranqadri \r\n\r\nFor question 2, when you say \r\n\r\n> You have to use hook for location which is useLocation.\r\n\r\nThe example, https://reacttraining.com/react-router/web/example/modal-gallery , already uses useLocation. The problem seems to be that you need to show two routes at the same time if the \"location\" prop is a certain location but we no longer have a \"location\" prop\r\n\r\nCould you maybe elaborate a bit more on how to achieve

guys! \r\nWe're very excited about this new version of react-router! We've been doing some testing on a few existing projects runing previous versions of react-router and found a problem with animated transitions. \r\n\r\nIn previous versions of react-router the **`location`** prop on the **`<Switch>`** component was a key element for creating animated route transitions like the one on the React Router documentation example: https://reacttraining.com/react-router/web/example/animated-transitions.\r\n\r\nNow, with the new **`<Routes>`** component the **`location`** prop is gone, and all our transitions don't work as expected. \r\n\r\nThis problem can be seen on the following link, it's the documentation example migrated to react-router 6:  [https://codesandbox.io/s/react-router-animated-transitions-2zovw](https://codesandbox.io/s/react-router-animated-transitions-2zovw)\r\n\r\nIs there any workaround to fix this behaviour on this upcoming version?\r\n\r\nThanks!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/remix-run/react-router/issues/7280/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/remix-run/react-router/issues/7280/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/remix-run/react-router/issues/comments/618887716","html_url":"https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/issues/7117#issuecomment-618887716","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/remix-run/react-router/issues/7117","id":618887716,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYxODg4NzcxNg==","user":{"login":"MeiKatz","id":1072475,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNzI0NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1072475?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MeiKatz","html_url":"https://github.com/MeiKatz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MeiKatz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MeiKatz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MeiKatz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MeiKatz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MeiKatz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MeiKatz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MeiKatz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MeiKatz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MeiKatz/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-04-24T08:48:13Z","updated_at":"2020-04-24T08:48:13Z","body":"@ajsmth I tried to find the episode you mentioned but couldn't find it.
