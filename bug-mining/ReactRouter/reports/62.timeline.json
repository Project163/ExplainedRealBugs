have a somewhat valid use case - we have this outdated library that uses homemade Portals (react-toolbox, that we forked a while back for accessibility) to make Dialogs and pop-up components.

@ajsmth Can you please say more about why you want to build your own `useRoutes`?\r\n> \r\n> @delucis It sounds like a simple hook that returns a boolean would work in your case?

Sometimes in a native application we would want to hold onto previously rendered routes to preserve there implicit UI (things like scroll position), I'm not sure how I would do that without modifying / customizing useRoutes\r\n\r\nIt would also let people customize their API if they aren't a fan of the element prop and would prefer using children.","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/remix-run/react-router/issues/comments/618577625/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"ajsmth","id":40680668,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwNjgwNjY4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/40680668?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajsmth","html_url":"https://github.com/ajsmth","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajsmth/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajsmth/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajsmth/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajsmth/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajsmth/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajsmth/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajsmth/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajsmth/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ajsmth/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":3266328005,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MzI2NjMyODAwNQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/remix-run/react-router/issues/events/3266328005","actor":{"login":"mjackson","id":92839,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyODM5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/92839?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjackson","html_url":"https://github.com/mjackson","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjackson/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjackson/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjackson/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjackson/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjackson/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjackson/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjackson/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjackson/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjackson/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2020-04-23T18:34:58Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
