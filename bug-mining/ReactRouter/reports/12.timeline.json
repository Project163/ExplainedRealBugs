(node_modules/react-router/Route.js:66:22) is\r\n``` javascript\r\n  Route.prototype.computeMatch = function computeMatch(_ref, _ref2) {\r\n    var computedMatch = _ref.computedMatch,\r\n        location = _ref.location,\r\n        path = _ref.path,\r\n        strict = _ref.strict,\r\n        exact = _ref.exact;\r\n    var route = _ref2.route; // _ref2 is undefined\r\n```\r\n\r\nPassing `{ withRef: true }` to `withRouter` has no effect.\r\n\r\nThis makes it hard to unit test any component that renders as one of its children a component wrapped in `withRouter`. \r\n\r\nCan be worked-around by inserting a `Router`.\r\n``` javascript\r\nimport { MemoryRouter as Router, withRouter } from 'react-router-dom' // 4.0.0\r\n\r\nit('will pass', () => {\r\n  expect(\r\n    renderer.create(<Router><WrappedComponent /></Router>)\r\n    .toJSON()\r\n  ).toEqual({children: null, props: {}, type: 'div'})\r\n})\r\n```\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\npossibly related bugfix here
