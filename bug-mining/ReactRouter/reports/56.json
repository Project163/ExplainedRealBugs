Apologies if I missed it.\r\n\r\nThe issue is that when I try to use a component wrapped with `withRouter` inside a `NavLink`, I don't get the correct `match` prop. Weirdly, this is only an issue with `NavLink`. Everything works correctly within a regular `Link`. \r\n\r\n## Version\r\n\r\nReact Router Dom 4.3.1\r\n\r\n## Test Case\r\n\r\nhttps://gist.github.com/zfletch/28bbaa330756607d40e4c2acf7d980b2\r\n\r\n(Uncomment the `NavLink` code and click on the `person 2` to see it break).\r\n\r\n## Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\n1. Create a component using `withRouter`\r\n2. Use `this.props.match.params` in that component\r\n3. Place that component in a `<NavLink>` tag\r\n\r\n## Expected Behavior\r\n\r\nIt should work like in any other component (including `<Link>`). The `match` and `params` should be present.\r\n\r\n## Actual Behavior\r\n\r\n`match` is `null` in some cases and `{}` in other cases. This causes incorrect behavior and errors when one of these components is used inside `<NavLink>`.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"timdorr","id":17882,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3ODgy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17882?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/timdorr","html_url":"https://github.com/timdorr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timdorr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timdorr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timdorr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timdorr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timdorr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timdorr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timdorr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timdorr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timdorr/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/remix-run/react-router/issues/6613/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/remix-run/react-router/issues/6613/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
