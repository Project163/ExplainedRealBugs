I was confused why they were broken, until I stumbled upon issue #8350 and realized that there was an undocumented change making index routes behave differently.\r\n\r\nThe documentation should be changed to reflect this behavior.","closed_by":{"login":"ryanflorence","id":100200,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMDIwMA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/100200?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanflorence","html_url":"https://github.com/ryanflorence","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanflorence/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanflorence/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanflorence/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanflorence/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanflorence/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanflorence/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanflorence/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanflorence/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanflorence/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/remix-run/react-router/issues/12122/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/remix-run/react-router/issues/12122/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
