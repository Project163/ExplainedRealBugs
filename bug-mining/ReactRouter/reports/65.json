Version\r\n\r\n`v6.0.0-beta.0`\r\n\r\n## Test Case\r\n\r\nhttps://codesandbox.io/s/react-router-600-beta0-2n4ut\r\n\r\n## Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/50610/107079246-90c15000-67bd-11eb-96bd-3596a9ca135d.mov\r\n\r\n## Expected Behavior\r\n\r\n`+` is a valid character (not an encoding) for pathname of URL, as referenced here: https://stackoverflow.com/a/1006074 and by Michael Jackson for past versions of this library here: https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router/issues/716#issuecomment-71346876\r\n\r\n## Actual Behavior\r\n\r\n`+` character in pathname is turned into ` ` (space character)\r\n\r\nThis is breaking our existing valid URLs that have a + in the pathname of the URL such as `/brand/abraham+ivy/` (the brand's actual name is \"abraham+ivy\").\r\n\r\n## Reference\r\n\r\nSome context that might be illuminating:\r\n\r\nThe code seems to be doing this intentionally but looks like it have have been inspired by code from an old version of this library that itself later had this behavior removed due to it being a bug:\r\n- https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router/commit/fbc109c0218508a301caae36469c8fc5d70de5fa\r\n-
