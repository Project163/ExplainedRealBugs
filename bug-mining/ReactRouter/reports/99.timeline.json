But its a bug in Chrome. `react-router-dom` and `react-router-redux` are using `history` which eventually uses `window.history.pushState` which on Chrome causes an unnecessary network request.\r\nThis is a pretty bad bug since it causes massive unnecessary traffic.\r\nYou can easily observe this in all your `react-router` based projects - just check the devtools or see the increase in traffic to your servers.\r\nCheers\r\nBernd","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/remix-run/react-router/issues/comments/290248906/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"BerndWessels","id":1776695,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NzY2OTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1776695?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BerndWessels","html_url":"https://github.com/BerndWessels","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BerndWessels/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BerndWessels/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BerndWessels/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BerndWessels/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BerndWessels/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BerndWessels/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BerndWessels/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BerndWessels/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BerndWessels/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":1021356510,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50MTAyMTM1NjUxMA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/remix-run/react-router/issues/events/1021356510","actor":{"login":"timdorr","id":17882,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3ODgy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17882?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/timdorr","html_url":"https://github.com/timdorr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timdorr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timdorr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timdorr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timdorr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timdorr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timdorr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timdorr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timdorr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timdorr/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2017-03-29T22:43:52Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":1021356511,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDEwMjEzNTY1MTE=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/remix-run/react-router/issues/events/1021356511","actor":{"login":"timdorr","id":17882,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3ODgy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17882?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/timdorr","html_url":"https://github.com/timdorr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timdorr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timdorr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timdorr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timdorr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timdorr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timdorr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timdorr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timdorr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timdorr/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2017-03-29T22:43:52Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/remix-run/react-router/issues/comments/290287677","html_url":"https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/issues/4864#issuecomment-290287677","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/remix-run/react-router/issues/4864","id":290287677,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI5MDI4NzY3Nw==","user":{"login":"timdorr","id":17882,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3ODgy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17882?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/timdorr","html_url":"https://github.com/timdorr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timdorr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timdorr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timdorr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timdorr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timdorr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timdorr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timdorr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timdorr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timdorr/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2017-03-30T02:54:59Z","updated_at":"2017-03-30T
