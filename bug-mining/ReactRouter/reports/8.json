There's a few suggestions at the bottom.\n\nI started to use `<Redirect>` to redirect to a new URL after a successful form submission with the following pattern (simplified here, I'm just keeping the bits related to `<Redirect>`):\n\n``` javascript\nclass MyForm extends React.Component {\n\n    state = {\n        result: {}\n    }\n\n    handleSubmit() {\n        // ...\n        if (result.isValid) {\n            this.setState({result})\n        }\n    }\n\n    render() {\n        const {result} = this.state\n        if (result.isValid) {\n            return <Redirect to=\"/success/\" />\n        }\n    }\n\n}\n```\n\nBasically this is a client-side implementation of the old server-side POST-redirect-GET pattern.\n\nI noticed that with this implementation the Back button doesn't work. Indeed `<Redirect>` doesn't add a new entry to the history.\n\nThe docs say:\n\n> Rendering a Redirect will navigate to a new location and add the previous location onto the next location state.\n\nI'm failing to understand what \"adding onto the next location state\" means. I guessed it meant \"adding an entry to the history\", but apparently, it's rather \"overwriting the current location with the next location\". Unless this sentence talks about something else entirely?\n\nHere's a few some suggestions for which I'm happy to provide a pull request if you think they're appropriate.\n1. make `transitionTo` the default behavior of `<Redirect>`, as it's less likely to corrupt history inadvertently than `replaceWith`. By defaulting to `replaceWith`, the seemingly innocuous use of `<Redirect>` I showed above doesn't record history, which is a bug. I'm afraid many websites could end up with broken histories because of this.\n2. make it possible to redirect either with `transitionTo` or `replaceWith`, perhaps by providing one component for each behavior, or a prop on Redirect to select the behavior. I'm unsure when `replaceWith` would be appropriate, but I assume you had a reason to choose it and would like to preserve that possibility in the API.\n3. if appropriate, clarify that sentence I quoted above — I'm not a native speaker and I admit that I can be clueless when it comes to frontend, but I've been developing for the web for 10 years and I'm a Django core dev, so not a total noob; I've also written several dozen pages of docs for Django; if I don't get something, it's likely that I'm not the only one.\n\nThanks for your consideration! Let me know if some of these ideas seem worth discussing further.\n","closed_by":{"login":"ryanflorence","id":100200,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMDIwMA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/100200?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanflorence","html_url":"https://github.com/ryanflorence","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanflorence/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanflorence/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanflorence/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanflorence/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanflorence/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanflorence/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanflorence/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanflorence/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanflorence/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/remix-run/react-router/issues/3903/reactions","total_count":9,"+1":9,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/remix-run/react-router/issues/3903/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
