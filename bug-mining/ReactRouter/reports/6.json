So then I removed `<Navbar />` component and all `<Match />` components  except for the first one that uses the pattern `'/'` and it worked. But As soon as I add one more to the mix it fails. So I thought okay what If I add another <Match /> that renders the same `HomeContainer` component. Again it still failed to render.\n\nHeres the code that **fails**:\n\n``` js\nimport React from 'react';\nimport Router from 'react-router/BrowserRouter'\nimport Match from 'react-router/Match'\nimport Miss from 'react-router/Miss'\n// other components...\n\nrender(\n  (\n    <Provider store={store}>\n      <Router>\n        <Navbar isAuthenticated={true}/>\n\n        <Match exactly pattern='/' component={HomeContainer}/>\n        <Match pattern='/:username' component={ProfileContainer} />\n        <Match pattern='/:username/:repo' component={RepoContainer} />\n        <Match pattern='studio' component={StudioContainer} />\n        <Miss component={NotFound} />\n      </Router>\n    </Provider>\n  ), document.getElementById('app')\n);\n```\n\nThis code below **works**:\n\n``` js\nimport React from 'react';\nimport Router from 'react-router/BrowserRouter'\nimport Match from 'react-router/Match'\nimport Miss from 'react-router/Miss'\n// other components...\n\nrender(\n  (\n    <Provider store={store}>\n      <Router>\n        <Match exactly pattern='/' component={HomeContainer}/>\n      </Router>\n    </Provider>\n  ), document.getElementById('app')\n);\n```\n\nThis code also **fails**:\n\n``` js\nimport React from 'react';\nimport Router from 'react-router/BrowserRouter'\nimport Match from 'react-router/Match'\nimport Miss from 'react-router/Miss'\n// other components...\n\nrender(\n  (\n    <Provider store={store}>\n      <Router>\n        <Match exactly pattern='/' component={HomeContainer}/>\n        <Match pattern='/lol' component={HomeContainer} />\n      </Router>\n    </Provider>\n  ), document.getElementById('app')\n);\n```\n\nI've tried to follow along with the website but can't seem to find a fix.\n","closed_by":{"login":"timdorr","id":17882,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3ODgy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17882?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/timdorr","html_url":"https://github.com/timdorr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timdorr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timdorr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timdorr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timdorr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timdorr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timdorr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timdorr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timdorr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timdorr/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/remix-run/react-router/issues/3837/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/remix-run/react-router/issues/3837/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
