the current 4.4 beta, we provide 4 different builds of all our code in the `react-router`, `react-router-dom`, and `react-router-config` packages:\r\n\r\n- A development CommonJS build in separate files in the package root\r\n- A development ES modules build in separate files in the `es` folder in the package root\r\n- A development UMD bundle in the `umd` folder in the package root\r\n- A production UMD bundle in the `umd` folder in the package root\r\n\r\n## The Proposal\r\n\r\nThere are 2 things I'd like to change:\r\n\r\n- We should provide production versions (w/out warnings) of our CJS and ESM builds. This is honestly just an oversight in our current build strategy.\r\n- We should stop providing separate files and deprecate stuff like `require('react-router/BrowserRouter')`. The separate files were supposed to provide a way for users to include only a portion of the library w/out including the whole thing (i.e. \"poor man's\" tree shaking). We actually take advantage of this ourselves in a few builds (e.g. [the CJS version of `react-router-dom`](https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router/blob/master/packages/react-router-dom/modules/.babelrc#L10-L17)) to include only the modules from `react-router` that we need using `babel-plugin-transform-imports`. However, tools like rollup and webpack 4 have made it possible to do real tree shaking, so I'd prefer to tell people to update their build tooling instead of providing a bunch of separate files. This would also let us remove `babel-plugin-transform-imports` and simplify some of our tooling.\r\n\r\n## The Plan\r\n\r\n4.4: Use rollup for all our builds, including CJS and ESM. Builds should be available in one of 3 folders that denotes the type of the build: `cjs`, `esm`, or `umd`. So e.g. we should have the following files for the `react-router` package:\r\n\r\n- `cjs/react-router.js` (new)\r\n- `cjs/react-router.min.js` (new)\r\n- `esm/react-router.js` (new)\r\n- `esm/react-router.min.js` (new)\r\n- `umd/react-router.js`\r\n- `umd/react-router.min.js`\r\n\r\nTo help users with the migration, we can keep separate files in place that print warnings telling them to `require`/`import` the main package instead of that individual file. For bundlers using the CJS/ESM builds, we can provide a small stub file as the entry point that exports either the development or production build depending on the value of `process.env.NODE_ENV`. For example, the CJS entry point for `react-router` would look something like this:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nif (process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production') {\r\n  module.exports = require('./cjs/react-router.min.js');\r\n} else {\r\n  module.exports = require('./cjs/react-router.js');\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nUsers can set `process.env.NODE_ENV` in their bundler to opt in to one build or the other, same as they do when bundling React itself.\r\n\r\n5.0: Remove the stubs with warnings and stop supporting old `require`/`import` from separate files.\r\n\r\nThoughts and/or concerns?
