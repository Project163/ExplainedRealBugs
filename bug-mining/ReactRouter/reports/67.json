It defaulted to `a`.\r\nMany use component libraries that provide styled anchor links with their own styles, but now there's no way to replace the `a` element.\r\n\r\nSee https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router/blob/81a5079bf90da0741a61001297926113b112b1d4/packages/react-router-dom/index.tsx#L256.\r\n\r\nThe migration guide suggests [`component` was renamed to `as`](https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router/blob/dev/docs/advanced-guides/migrating-5-to-6.md#rename-link-component-to-link-as-and-navlink-exact-to-navlink-end), but that doesn't work either.\r\n\r\nAlternatives include making the styled components wrap an anchor child, but:\r\n1. It's often not an option when a UI library is external or unmaintaned;\r\n2. It unnecessarily polutes the DOM and our code.\r\n\r\n## Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\n```jsx\r\nimport { Link } from 'react-router-dom';\r\n\r\nfunction Foo(props) {\r\n    return <a {...props} className=\"foo\" />;\r\n}\r\n\r\nfunction App() {\r\n    // TODO Setup BrowserRouter & Routes\r\n    return <Link to=\"bar\" component={Foo}>Something</a>;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Expected Behavior\r\n\r\n`<a href=\"bar\" class=\"foo\">Something</a>` is rendered to the DOM.\r\n\r\n## Actual Behavior\r\n\r\n`<a href=\"bar\" component=\"[object Object]\">Something</a>` is rendered instead.\r\n\r\nTS now errors because `LinkProps` doesn't contain a `component` prop.","closed_by":{"login":"chaance","id":3082153,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwODIxNTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3082153?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chaance","html_url":"https://github.com/chaance","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chaance/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chaance/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chaance/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chaance/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chaance/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chaance/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chaance/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chaance/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chaance/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/remix-run/react-router/issues/7598/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/remix-run/react-router/issues/7598/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
