For me, this led to the `react-router` folder weighing in at ~234MB. A lot of these are duplicated across packages and should be able to be moved to the root `package.json`. The only ones that can't, as noted by the [lerna documentation](https://github.com/lerna/lerna#common-devdependencies) are the ones that need binaries to run (i.e., `karma`).\r\n\r\nFor reference, across each `package.json` each dependency is included the following number of times:\r\n\r\n| Package | Count |\r\n| --- | --- |\r\nbabel-cli | 2 \r\nbabel-core | 1\r\nbabel-eslint | 2\r\nbabel-loader | 3\r\nbabel-plugin-dev-expression | 2\r\nbabel-plugin-transform-react-remove-prop-types | 2\r\nbabel-preset-es2015 | 3\r\nbabel-preset-react | 3\r\nbabel-preset-stage-1 | 3\r\nbundle-loader | 1\r\ncopy-webpack-plugin | 1\r\ncss-loader | 1\r\neslint | 2\r\neslint-plugin-import | 2\r\neslint-plugin-react | 2\r\nexpect | 2\r\nfile-loader | 1\r\ngzip-size | 2\r\nhtml-loader | 1\r\nhtml-webpack-plugin | 1\r\nin-publish | 2\r\njsxstyle | 1\r\nkarma | 2\r\nkarma-browserstack-launcher | 2\r\nkarma-chrome-launcher | 2\r\nkarma-mocha | 2\r\nkarma-mocha-reporter | 2\r\nkarma-sourcemap-loader | 2\r\nkarma-webpack | 2\r\nmarkdown-it | 1\r\nmarkdown-it-anchor | 1\r\nmocha | 2\r\npostcss-loader | 1\r\npretty-bytes | 2\r\nprismjs-loader | 1\r\nreact | 4\r\nreact-addons-test-utils | 2\r\nreact-dom | 3\r\nreact-motion | 1\r\nreact-native | 1\r\nreadline-sync | 2\r\nstyle-loader | 1\r\nsw-precache | 1\r\nsw-precache-webpack-plugin | 1\r\nurl-loader | 1\r\nwebpack | 3\r\nwebpack-dev-server| 3","closed_by":{"login":"timdorr","id":17882,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3ODgy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17882?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/timdorr","html_url":"https://github.com/timdorr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timdorr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timdorr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timdorr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timdorr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timdorr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timdorr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timdorr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timdorr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timdorr/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/remix-run/react-router/issues/4362/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/remix-run/react-router/issues/4362/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
