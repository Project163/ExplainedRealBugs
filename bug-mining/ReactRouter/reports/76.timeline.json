href=\"https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/releases/tag/v6.0.0-beta.8\">2021-10-22</a></br><p>Remember last week when we said</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>We anticipate this will be the last beta release before v6 stable next week.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Yeah, about that … 😅</p>\n<p>We found and squashed a few high-priority bugs that needed to be addressed first. But it's coming very soon, we promise! In the mean time, here's what you'll get from our eight-est and greatest beta release:</p>\n<h2>🐛 Bug Fixes</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>We fixed a few bugs in <code>useHref</code> that resulted in the incorrect resolved value in cases where a <code>basename</code> is used on the <code>&lt;Router /&gt;</code> component (See <a href=\"https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/issues/8133\" data-hovercard-type=\"issue\" data-hovercard-url=\"/remix-run/react-router/issues/8133/hovercard\">#8133</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/issues/8142\" data-hovercard-type=\"issue\" data-hovercard-url=\"/remix-run/react-router/issues/8142/hovercard\">#8142</a> for details).</li>\n<li>We also fixed a bug in our path ranking algorithm so that splat routes (routes with a <code>*</code> path value) are now correctly ranked ahead of layout routes.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>🗒️ Docs</h2>\n<p>We've added lots of goodies to our <code>docs</code> and <code>examples</code>, and there's a lot more yet to come. Take a look and see if you find something that makes your work a little easier! We think the <a href=\"https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/tree/dev/examples/lazy-loading\">lazy loading</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/tree/dev/examples/custom-query-parsing\">custom query parsing</a> examples are particularly cool! 🤓</p>\n      </li>\n      <li>\n        <b>6.0.0-beta.7</b> - <a href=\"https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/releases/tag/v6.0.0-beta.7\">2021-10-15</a></br><p>In this release we made a small but significant change to how <code>&lt;Link to=\"..\"&gt;</code> works. This is going to help out a lot if you were trying to use links in a <code>*</code> route.</p>\n<p>We have also backed out our blocking/prompt APIs for the stable v6 release. We will revisit this post 6.0 when we have a little more time to get it right.</p>\n<h2>✨ Features</h2>\n<p>The major change in this release could also be classified as a bugfix or a breaking change, depending on how you look at it. We essentialy altered the way <code>&lt;Link to=\"..\"&gt;</code> works. See <a class=\"issue-link js-issue-link\" data-error-text=\"Failed to load title\" data-id=\"1011480834\" data-permission-text=\"Title is private\" data-url=\"https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/issues/8086\" data-hovercard-type=\"issue\" data-hovercard-url=\"/remix-run/react-router/issues/8086/hovercard\" href=\"https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/issues/8086\">#8086</a> for the motivation behind this change.</p>\n<p>You'll probably want to reread <a href=\"https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/blob/main/docs/guides/migrating-5-to-6.md#note-on-link-to-values\">the section in the v5 =&gt; v6 migration guide about <code>&lt;Link to&gt;</code> values</a> (it has been updated), but it basically boils down to this: <strong>any leading <code>..</code> segment in a <code>&lt;Link to&gt;</code> value traverses \"up\" one route and builds upon that route's path instead of just removing one URL segment</strong>. This feature really completes the story of relative routes and links.</p>\n<p>We could consider this a bugfix, since this is how it was always intended to work in the first place. Without it, you'd have a difficult time linking predictably in <code>*</code> routes because your <code>&lt;a href&gt;</code> would be different depending on the number of segments in the current URL.</p>\n<p>The reason this could also be considered a breaking change is that <code>..</code> now works slightly differently in <code>&lt;Link to&gt;</code> than it would in <code>&lt;a href&gt;</code>. When you have <code>&lt;a href=\"..\"&gt;</code> it operates on the URL pathname, removing one segment of the current URL. However, since many routes really only match a single segment of the URL, there is often no difference between <code>&lt;Link to=\"..\"&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;a href=\"..\"&gt;</code>.</p>\n<h2>💔 Breaking Changes</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>We removed <code>useBlocker()</code>, <code>usePrompt()</code>, and <code>&lt;Prompt&gt;</code> for now. We will revisit these post 6.0 when we have more time to get it right. But we don't want it to <em>block</em> (see what I did there) the release of all the other awesome stuff we've got in v6.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>🛠 Roadmap</h2>\n<p>We anticipate this will be the last beta release before v6 stable next week. Please give it a shot and let us know how it goes!</p>\n<h2>👍 Upgrading</h2>\n<p>If you're thinking about upgrading to v6, I published a few notes this past week that may help you:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://gist.github.com/mjackson/b5748add2795ce7448a366ae8f8ae3bb\">This note talks about removing <code>&lt;Redirect&gt;</code> elements from any <code>&lt;Switch&gt;</code>es you may have in your v5 app</a> and how you can get better SEO in the process if you're currently relying on client-side redirects.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://gist.github.com/mjackson/d54b40a094277b7afdd6b81f51a0393f\">This note talks about how to refactor your code to avoid \"wrapping\" <code>&lt;Route&gt;</code> elements</a>, which won't work in v6.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Both of those posts contain steps you can take <strong>today in your v5 app</strong> without upgrading to v6.</p>\n<p>We are also developing a backwards compat lib that should help some of you upgrade from v5 to v6. We'll post more about this when it's ready.</p>\n<h2>💻 Installing</h2>\n<p>Development for v6 has switched from <code>dev</code> <a href=\"https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/tree/main\">to the <code>main</code> branch</a>.</p>\n<p>If you'd like to test it out, install from npm:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight highlight-source-shell notranslate position-relative overflow-auto\" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content=\"$ npm install history react-router-dom@next\"><pre>$ npm install <span class=\"pl-c1\">history</span> react-router-dom@next</pre></div>\n      </li>\n      <li>\n        <b>6.0.0-beta.6</b> - <a href=\"https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/releases/tag/v6.0.0-beta.6\">2021-10-07</a></br><p>No big enhancements in this release, just squashing bugs and writing lots of tests! Also, we are hard at work on cranking out examples for v6. See the end of this post for an update on our roadmap between here and v6 stable.</p>\n<h2>🧰 Examples</h2>\n<p>We have begun creating some examples for v6 that we hope will help developers make effective use of all the new features we have. So far, we have examples for the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/tree/dev/examples/basic\">Basic Example</a> – A basic client-side app for v6 showing how to use nested routes, layouts, links, and the new <code>&lt;Outlet&gt;</code> API</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/tree/dev/examples/auth\">Auth Example</a> – Demonstrates an authentication flow including using the new <code>useNavigate()</code> hook, the <code>&lt;Navigate&gt;</code> element, and <code>location.state</code></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/tree/dev/examples/search-params\">Search Params Example</a> – Demonstrates how to build a simple search form that uses the new <code>useSearchParams()</code> hook</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/tree/dev/examples/ssr\">SSR Example</a> – A server-rendered app that uses <code>&lt;StaticRouter&gt;</code> on the server and uses a <code>&lt;BrowserRouter&gt;</code> with <code>ReactDOM.hydrate()</code> on the client</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Each example includes a button in the README that allows you to instantly launch a running instance on StackBlitz that you can play with.

This means that <code>&lt;Route path=\"files*\"&gt;</code> will always match as if it were <code>&lt;Route path=\"files/*\"&gt;</code>. The router will issue a warning if your route path ends with <code>*</code> but not <code>/*</code></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>🛠 Roadmap</h2>\n<p>We are very close to a stable release! The last big code changes we need to make are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Fixing \"linking up\". Currently a <code>&lt;Link to=\"..\"&gt;</code> operates on the URL pathname. However, this makes it difficult to link to the parent route when you're in a splat route. See <a class=\"issue-link js-issue-link\" data-error-text=\"Failed to load title\" data-id=\"1011480834\" data-permission-text=\"Title is private\" data-url=\"https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/issues/8086\" data-hovercard-type=\"issue\" data-hovercard-url=\"/remix-run/react-router/issues/8086/hovercard\" href=\"https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/issues/8086\">#8086</a>. This will be a breaking change.</li>\n<li>We are going to remove <code>useBlocker()</code> and <code>&lt;Prompt&gt;</code> in our initial v6 release, with plans to revisit them and possibly add them back at some point in the future. I still need to write up something here that explains our rationale. This will also be a breaking change.</li>\n<li>We are going to add some animation primitives (see <a class=\"issue-link js-issue-link\" data-error-text=\"Failed to load title\" data-id=\"3555633\" data-permission-text=\"Title is private\" data-url=\"https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/discussions/8008\" data-hovercard-type=\"discussion\" data-hovercard-url=\"/remix-run/react-router/discussions/8008/hovercard\" href=\"https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/discussions/8008\">#8008</a>). The <code>&lt;Routes location&gt;</code> prop will be in v6, but it isn't ideal for animation.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>💻 Installing</h2>\n<p>Development for v6 is chugging along <a href=\"https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/tree/dev\">on the <code>dev</code> branch</a>.</p>\n<p>If you'd like to test it out, install from npm:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight highlight-source-shell notranslate position-relative overflow-auto\" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content=\"$ npm install history react-router-dom@next\"><pre>$ npm install <span class=\"pl-c1\">history</span> react-router-dom@next</pre></div>\n      </li>\n      <li>\n        <b>6.0.0-beta.5</b> - <a href=\"https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/releases/tag/v6.0.0-beta.5\">2021-09-25</a></br><p>This week's release adds some much-needed polish to a few niche features of the router: splat routes (a route that uses a <code>*</code> path) and basenames. It also adds a <code>renderMatches</code> API that completes the story for those of you who may have been using <code>react-router-config</code> in v4 and v5.</p>\n<h2>🐛  Bugfixes</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>A <code>*</code> in a child route path matches <em>after</em> a slash following its parent route path. This fixes some situations where the <code>*</code> was overly greedy (see <a class=\"issue-link js-issue-link\" data-error-text=\"Failed to load title\" data-id=\"977000696\" data-permission-text=\"Title is private\" data-url=\"https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/issues/7972\" data-hovercard-type=\"issue\" data-hovercard-url=\"/remix-run/react-router/issues/7972/hovercard\" href=\"https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/issues/7972\">#7972</a>)</li>\n<li>Resolution of <code>&lt;Link to=\".\"&gt;</code> and <code>useResolvedPath(\".\")</code> values are fixed in splat routes. Previously these resolved relative to the parent route's path. They now resolve relative to the path of the route that rendered them.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>✨  Enhancements</h2>\n<p>This release makes it easier to work with apps that have multiple entry points. Using the <code>&lt;Router basename&gt;</code> prop allows React Router to be easily deployed on only a portion of a larger site by using a portion of the URL pathname (the \"basename\") to transparently prefix all route paths and link navigations.</p>\n<p>For example, you can deploy one React Router app at the <code>/inbox</code> URL prefix, and another one at the <code>/admin</code> prefix. These base URLs represent two different entry points into your app, each with its own bundles. The rest of your site, including the root / URL could be rendered by something other than React Router, for example by your server framework of choice.</p>\n<p>In the bundle for each entry point, simply initialize React Router with the basename of that entry point.</p>\n<div class=\"highlight highlight-source-tsx notranslate position-relative overflow-auto\" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content=\"&lt;Router basename=&quot;/inbox&quot;&gt;\n  // ...\n&lt;/Router&gt;\"><pre><span class=\"pl-c1\">&lt;</span><span class=\"pl-smi\">Router</span> <span class=\"pl-c1\">basename</span><span class=\"pl-c1\">=</span><span class=\"pl-s\">\"/inbox\"</span><span class=\"pl-c1\">&gt;</span>\n  // ...\n<span class=\"pl-c1\">&lt;</span><span class=\"pl-c1\">/</span><span class=\"pl-smi\">Router</span><span class=\"pl-c1\">&gt;</span></pre></div>\n<p>Then define your routes and link paths without using the <code>/inbox</code> URL prefix in any of them. The entire app will run relative to that prefix.</p>\n<p>Another improvement in this release is the addition of the <code>renderMatches</code> API, which is the complement of <code>matchRoutes</code>. These APIs are both very low-level and should not normally be needed. But they are sometimes nice to use if you are doing your own data loading using the array of <code>matches</code> that you get back from <code>matchRoutes</code>.</p>\n<p><code>matchRoutes</code> and <code>renderMatches</code> are the equivalent of the <code>react-router-config</code> package we shipped in v4 and v5, just built directly into the router instead of in a separate package.</p>\n<h2>💔 Breaking Changes</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><code>&lt;Routes basename&gt;</code> has moved to <code>&lt;Router basename&gt;</code>. This prop is also available on all router variants (<code>&lt;BrowserRouter&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;HashRouter&gt;</code>, etc.).</li>\n<li><code>useLocation().pathname</code> no longer includes the basename, if present.</li>\n<li>The <code>basename</code> argument was removed from <code>useRoutes</code>. This reverts the signature to <code>useRoutes(routes, location)</code>, same as it was previous to beta.4.</li>\n<li>Descendant <code>&lt;Routes&gt;</code> do not get the params from their parents. This helps a set of <code>&lt;Routes&gt;</code> to be more portable by decoupling it from the params of its parents and makes it easier to know which params will be returned from <code>useParams()</code>. If you were relying on this behavior previously, you'll need to pass along the params manually to the elements rendered by the descendant <code>&lt;Routes&gt;</code>. See <a href=\"https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/issues/8073#issuecomment-929687218\" data-hovercard-type=\"issue\" data-hovercard-url=\"/remix-run/react-router/issues/8073/hovercard\">this comment</a> for an example of how this is to be done and for a potential workaround if you really need the old behavior.</li>\n<li><code>match.pathname</code> in a splat route now includes the portion of the pathname matched by the <code>*</code>. This makes the <code>*</code> param behave much more like other dynamic <code>:id</code>-style params.</li>\n<li>Resolution of relative <code>&lt;Link&gt;</code>s in splat routes is changed now because the entire pathname that was matched by that route is now different (see previous bullet). Instead of resolving relative to the portion of the pathname before the <code>*</code>, paths resolve relative to the full pathname that was matched by the route.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>💻 Installing</h2>\n<p>Development for v6 is chugging along <a href=\"https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/tree/dev\">on the <code>dev</code> branch</a>.</p>\n<p>If you'd like to test it out, install from npm:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight highlight-source-shell notranslate position-relative overflow-auto\" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content=\"$ npm install history react-router-dom@next\"><pre>$ npm install <span class=\"pl-c1\">history</span> react-router-dom@next</pre></div>\n      </li>\n      <li>\n        <b>6.0.0-beta.4</b> - <a href=\"https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/releases/tag/v6.0.0-beta.4\">2021-09-11</a></br><p>Last week we released a lot of nice little bug features, but we did get a little carried away and let a little bug slip through with relative path resolution.

Let's dive in…</p>\n<h2>🐛 Bugfixes</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Path resolution for nested relative routes was broken in the last release and should now be fixed.

This is great for people who write their apps like this, but <strong>it technically could cause some breakage</strong> if you were using absolute paths (that start with <code>/</code>) in nested routes in previous betas. To fix this, simply <strong>remove the <code>/</code> from the beginning of any route paths that are meant to be relative</strong>. React Router will throw an error if you are using absolute paths that don't match their parent route paths. Hopefully this should help you find them if you are upgrading.</p>\n<p>If you were using <code>&lt;Route path=\"/\"&gt;</code> to indicate an index route, you can now use the new <code>&lt;Route index&gt;</code> prop to accomplish the same thing.

href=\"https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/releases/tag/v6.0.0-beta.8\">2021-10-22</a></br><p>Remember last week when we said</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>We anticipate this will be the last beta release before v6 stable next week.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Yeah, about that … 😅</p>\n<p>We found and squashed a few high-priority bugs that needed to be addressed first. But it's coming very soon, we promise! In the mean time, here's what you'll get from our eight-est and greatest beta release:</p>\n<h2>🐛 Bug Fixes</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>We fixed a few bugs in <code>useHref</code> that resulted in the incorrect resolved value in cases where a <code>basename</code> is used on the <code>&lt;Router /&gt;</code> component (See <a href=\"https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/issues/8133\" data-hovercard-type=\"issue\" data-hovercard-url=\"/remix-run/react-router/issues/8133/hovercard\">#8133</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/issues/8142\" data-hovercard-type=\"issue\" data-hovercard-url=\"/remix-run/react-router/issues/8142/hovercard\">#8142</a> for details).</li>\n<li>We also fixed a bug in our path ranking algorithm so that splat routes (routes with a <code>*</code> path value) are now correctly ranked ahead of layout routes.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>🗒️ Docs</h2>\n<p>We've added lots of goodies to our <code>docs</code> and <code>examples</code>, and there's a lot more yet to come. Take a look and see if you find something that makes your work a little easier! We think the <a href=\"https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/tree/dev/examples/lazy-loading\">lazy loading</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/tree/dev/examples/custom-query-parsing\">custom query parsing</a> examples are particularly cool! 🤓</p>\n      </li>\n      <li>\n        <b>6.0.0-beta.7</b> - <a href=\"https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/releases/tag/v6.0.0-beta.7\">2021-10-15</a></br><p>In this release we made a small but significant change to how <code>&lt;Link to=\"..\"&gt;</code> works. This is going to help out a lot if you were trying to use links in a <code>*</code> route.</p>\n<p>We have also backed out our blocking/prompt APIs for the stable v6 release. We will revisit this post 6.0 when we have a little more time to get it right.</p>\n<h2>✨ Features</h2>\n<p>The major change in this release could also be classified as a bugfix or a breaking change, depending on how you look at it. We essentialy altered the way <code>&lt;Link to=\"..\"&gt;</code> works. See <a class=\"issue-link js-issue-link\" data-error-text=\"Failed to load title\" data-id=\"1011480834\" data-permission-text=\"Title is private\" data-url=\"https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/issues/8086\" data-hovercard-type=\"issue\" data-hovercard-url=\"/remix-run/react-router/issues/8086/hovercard\" href=\"https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/issues/8086\">#8086</a> for the motivation behind this change.</p>\n<p>You'll probably want to reread <a href=\"https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/blob/main/docs/guides/migrating-5-to-6.md#note-on-link-to-values\">the section in the v5 =&gt; v6 migration guide about <code>&lt;Link to&gt;</code> values</a> (it has been updated), but it basically boils down to this: <strong>any leading <code>..</code> segment in a <code>&lt;Link to&gt;</code> value traverses \"up\" one route and builds upon that route's path instead of just removing one URL segment</strong>. This feature really completes the story of relative routes and links.</p>\n<p>We could consider this a bugfix, since this is how it was always intended to work in the first place. Without it, you'd have a difficult time linking predictably in <code>*</code> routes because your <code>&lt;a href&gt;</code> would be different depending on the number of segments in the current URL.</p>\n<p>The reason this could also be considered a breaking change is that <code>..</code> now works slightly differently in <code>&lt;Link to&gt;</code> than it would in <code>&lt;a href&gt;</code>. When you have <code>&lt;a href=\"..\"&gt;</code> it operates on the URL pathname, removing one segment of the current URL. However, since many routes really only match a single segment of the URL, there is often no difference between <code>&lt;Link to=\"..\"&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;a href=\"..\"&gt;</code>.</p>\n<h2>💔 Breaking Changes</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>We removed <code>useBlocker()</code>, <code>usePrompt()</code>, and <code>&lt;Prompt&gt;</code> for now. We will revisit these post 6.0 when we have more time to get it right. But we don't want it to <em>block</em> (see what I did there) the release of all the other awesome stuff we've got in v6.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>🛠 Roadmap</h2>\n<p>We anticipate this will be the last beta release before v6 stable next week. Please give it a shot and let us know how it goes!</p>\n<h2>👍 Upgrading</h2>\n<p>If you're thinking about upgrading to v6, I published a few notes this past week that may help you:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://gist.github.com/mjackson/b5748add2795ce7448a366ae8f8ae3bb\">This note talks about removing <code>&lt;Redirect&gt;</code> elements from any <code>&lt;Switch&gt;</code>es you may have in your v5 app</a> and how you can get better SEO in the process if you're currently relying on client-side redirects.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://gist.github.com/mjackson/d54b40a094277b7afdd6b81f51a0393f\">This note talks about how to refactor your code to avoid \"wrapping\" <code>&lt;Route&gt;</code> elements</a>, which won't work in v6.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Both of those posts contain steps you can take <strong>today in your v5 app</strong> without upgrading to v6.</p>\n<p>We are also developing a backwards compat lib that should help some of you upgrade from v5 to v6. We'll post more about this when it's ready.</p>\n<h2>💻 Installing</h2>\n<p>Development for v6 has switched from <code>dev</code> <a href=\"https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/tree/main\">to the <code>main</code> branch</a>.</p>\n<p>If you'd like to test it out, install from npm:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight highlight-source-shell notranslate position-relative overflow-auto\" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content=\"$ npm install history react-router-dom@next\"><pre>$ npm install <span class=\"pl-c1\">history</span> react-router-dom@next</pre></div>\n      </li>\n      <li>\n        <b>6.0.0-beta.6</b> - <a href=\"https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/releases/tag/v6.0.0-beta.6\">2021-10-07</a></br><p>No big enhancements in this release, just squashing bugs and writing lots of tests! Also, we are hard at work on cranking out examples for v6. See the end of this post for an update on our roadmap between here and v6 stable.</p>\n<h2>🧰 Examples</h2>\n<p>We have begun creating some examples for v6 that we hope will help developers make effective use of all the new features we have. So far, we have examples for the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/tree/dev/examples/basic\">Basic Example</a> – A basic client-side app for v6 showing how to use nested routes, layouts, links, and the new <code>&lt;Outlet&gt;</code> API</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/tree/dev/examples/auth\">Auth Example</a> – Demonstrates an authentication flow including using the new <code>useNavigate()</code> hook, the <code>&lt;Navigate&gt;</code> element, and <code>location.state</code></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/tree/dev/examples/search-params\">Search Params Example</a> – Demonstrates how to build a simple search form that uses the new <code>useSearchParams()</code> hook</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/tree/dev/examples/ssr\">SSR Example</a> – A server-rendered app that uses <code>&lt;StaticRouter&gt;</code> on the server and uses a <code>&lt;BrowserRouter&gt;</code> with <code>ReactDOM.hydrate()</code> on the client</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Each example includes a button in the README that allows you to instantly launch a running instance on StackBlitz that you can play with. We hope you enjoy exploring!</p>\n<h2>🐛  Bugfixes</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Make <code>&lt;NavLink&gt;</code> match only whole URL segments instead of pieces. This means that <code>&lt;NavLink to=\"/home/users\"&gt;</code> will still be active at <code>/home/users</code>, but not at <code>/home/users2</code>. See <a class=\"issue-link js-issue-link\" data-error-text=\"Failed to load title\" data-id=\"667165091\" data-permission-text=\"Title is private\" data-url=\"https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/issues/7523\" data-hovercard-type=\"issue\" data-hovercard-url=\"/remix-run/react-router/issues/7523/hovercard\" href=\"https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/issues/7523\">#7523</a></li>\n<li>Makes \"layout routes\" (routes with no <code>path</code>) never match unless one of their children do. See <a class=\"issue-link js-issue-link\" data-error-text=\"Failed to load title\" data-id=\"1011333475\" data-permission-text=\"Title is private\" data-url=\"https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/issues/8085\" data-hovercard-type=\"issue\" data-hovercard-url=\"/remix-run/react-router/issues/8085/hovercard\" href=\"https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/issues/8085\">#8085</a></li>\n<li>Fixes a route matching regression with splat routes that was introduced in beta.5. See <a class=\"issue-link js-issue-link\" data-error-text=\"Failed to load title\" data-id=\"1007185501\" data-permission-text=\"Title is private\" data-url=\"https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/issues/8072\" data-hovercard-type=\"issue\" data-hovercard-url=\"/remix-run/react-router/issues/8072/hovercard\" href=\"https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/issues/8072\">#8072</a> and <a class=\"issue-link js-issue-link\" data-error-text=\"Failed to load title\" data-id=\"1016281961\" data-permission-text=\"Title is private\" data-url=\"https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/issues/8109\" data-hovercard-type=\"issue\" data-hovercard-url=\"/remix-run/react-router/issues/8109/hovercard\" href=\"https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/issues/8109\">#8109</a></li>\n<li>Fixes matching a nested splat route. See <a class=\"commit-link\" data-hovercard-type=\"commit\" data-hovercard-url=\"https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/commit/af7d038eb308bbf6580565883f3195b6dce693cf/hovercard\" href=\"https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/commit/af7d038eb308bbf6580565883f3195b6dce693cf\"><tt>af7d038</tt></a></li>\n<li>Provide all parent route params to descendant <code>&lt;Routes&gt;</code>. This reverses a decision that we made in beta.5 to remove them. See <a class=\"issue-link js-issue-link\" data-error-text=\"Failed to load title\" data-id=\"1007299738\" data-permission-text=\"Title is private\" data-url=\"https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/issues/8073\" data-hovercard-type=\"issue\" data-hovercard-url=\"/remix-run/react-router/issues/8073/hovercard\" href=\"https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/issues/8073\">#8073</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>💔 Breaking Changes</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Splats in route paths (<code>*</code>) match only after a <code>/</code> in the URL. This means that <code>&lt;Route path=\"files*\"&gt;</code> will always match as if it were <code>&lt;Route path=\"files/*\"&gt;</code>. The router will issue a warning if your route path ends with <code>*</code> but not <code>/*</code></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>🛠 Roadmap</h2>\n<p>We are very close to a stable release! The last big code changes we need to make are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Fixing \"linking up\". Currently a <code>&lt;Link to=\"..\"&gt;</code> operates on the URL pathname. However, this makes it difficult to link to the parent route when you're in a splat route. See <a class=\"issue-link js-issue-link\" data-error-text=\"Failed to load title\" data-id=\"1011480834\" data-permission-text=\"Title is private\" data-url=\"https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/issues/8086\" data-hovercard-type=\"issue\" data-hovercard-url=\"/remix-run/react-router/issues/8086/hovercard\" href=\"https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/issues/8086\">#8086</a>. This will be a breaking change.</li>\n<li>We are going to remove <code>useBlocker()</code> and <code>&lt;Prompt&gt;</code> in our initial v6 release, with plans to revisit them and possibly add them back at some point in the future. I still need to write up something here that explains our rationale. This will also be a breaking change.</li>\n<li>We are going to add some animation primitives (see <a class=\"issue-link js-issue-link\" data-error-text=\"Failed to load title\" data-id=\"3555633\" data-permission-text=\"Title is private\" data-url=\"https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/discussions/8008\" data-hovercard-type=\"discussion\" data-hovercard-url=\"/remix-run/react-router/discussions/8008/hovercard\" href=\"https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/discussions/8008\">#8008</a>). The <code>&lt;Routes location&gt;</code> prop will be in v6, but it isn't ideal for animation.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>💻 Installing</h2>\n<p>Development for v6 is chugging along <a href=\"https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/tree/dev\">on the <code>dev</code> branch</a>.</p>\n<p>If you'd like to test it out, install from npm:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight highlight-source-shell notranslate position-relative overflow-auto\" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content=\"$ npm install history react-router-dom@next\"><pre>$ npm install <span class=\"pl-c1\">history</span> react-router-dom@next</pre></div>\n      </li>\n      <li>\n        <b>6.0.0-beta.5</b> - <a href=\"https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/releases/tag/v6.0.0-beta.5\">2021-09-25</a></br><p>This week's release adds some much-needed polish to a few niche features of the router: splat routes (a route that uses a <code>*</code> path) and basenames. It also adds a <code>renderMatches</code> API that completes the story for those of you who may have been using <code>react-router-config</code> in v4 and v5.</p>\n<h2>🐛  Bugfixes</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>A <code>*</code> in a child route path matches <em>after</em> a slash following its parent route path. This fixes some situations where the <code>*</code> was overly greedy (see <a class=\"issue-link js-issue-link\" data-error-text=\"Failed to load title\" data-id=\"977000696\" data-permission-text=\"Title is private\" data-url=\"https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/issues/7972\" data-hovercard-type=\"issue\" data-hovercard-url=\"/remix-run/react-router/issues/7972/hovercard\" href=\"https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/issues/7972\">#7972</a>)</li>\n<li>Resolution of <code>&lt;Link to=\".\"&gt;</code> and <code>useResolvedPath(\".\")</code> values are fixed in splat routes. Previously these resolved relative to the parent route's path. They now resolve relative to the path of the route that rendered them.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>✨  Enhancements</h2>\n<p>This release makes it easier to work with apps that have multiple entry points. Using the <code>&lt;Router basename&gt;</code> prop allows React Router to be easily deployed on only a portion of a larger site by using a portion of the URL pathname (the \"basename\") to transparently prefix all route paths and link navigations.</p>\n<p>For example, you can deploy one React Router app at the <code>/inbox</code> URL prefix, and another one at the <code>/admin</code> prefix. These base URLs represent two different entry points into your app, each with its own bundles. The rest of your site, including the root / URL could be rendered by something other than React Router, for example by your server framework of choice.</p>\n<p>In the bundle for each entry point, simply initialize React Router with the basename of that entry point.</p>\n<div class=\"highlight highlight-source-tsx notranslate position-relative overflow-auto\" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content=\"&lt;Router basename=&quot;/inbox&quot;&gt;\n  // ...\n&lt;/Router&gt;\"><pre><span class=\"pl-c1\">&lt;</span><span class=\"pl-smi\">Router</span> <span class=\"pl-c1\">basename</span><span class=\"pl-c1\">=</span><span class=\"pl-s\">\"/inbox\"</span><span class=\"pl-c1\">&gt;</span>\n  // ...\n<span class=\"pl-c1\">&lt;</span><span class=\"pl-c1\">/</span><span class=\"pl-smi\">Router</span><span class=\"pl-c1\">&gt;</span></pre></div>\n<p>Then define your routes and link paths without using the <code>/inbox</code> URL prefix in any of them. The entire app will run relative to that prefix.</p>\n<p>Another improvement in this release is the addition of the <code>renderMatches</code> API, which is the complement of <code>matchRoutes</code>. These APIs are both very low-level and should not normally be needed. But they are sometimes nice to use if you are doing your own data loading using the array of <code>matches</code> that you get back from <code>matchRoutes</code>.</p>\n<p><code>matchRoutes</code> and <code>renderMatches</code> are the equivalent of the <code>react-router-config</code> package we shipped in v4 and v5, just built directly into the router instead of in a separate package.</p>\n<h2>💔 Breaking Changes</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><code>&lt;Routes basename&gt;</code> has moved to <code>&lt;Router basename&gt;</code>. This prop is also available on all router variants (<code>&lt;BrowserRouter&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;HashRouter&gt;</code>, etc.).</li>\n<li><code>useLocation().pathname</code> no longer includes the basename, if present.</li>\n<li>The <code>basename</code> argument was removed from <code>useRoutes</code>. This reverts the signature to <code>useRoutes(routes, location)</code>, same as it was previous to beta.4.</li>\n<li>Descendant <code>&lt;Routes&gt;</code> do not get the params from their parents. This helps a set of <code>&lt;Routes&gt;</code> to be more portable by decoupling it from the params of its parents and makes it easier to know which params will be returned from <code>useParams()</code>. If you were relying on this behavior previously, you'll need to pass along the params manually to the elements rendered by the descendant <code>&lt;Routes&gt;</code>. See <a href=\"https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/issues/8073#issuecomment-929687218\" data-hovercard-type=\"issue\" data-hovercard-url=\"/remix-run/react-router/issues/8073/hovercard\">this comment</a> for an example of how this is to be done and for a potential workaround if you really need the old behavior.</li>\n<li><code>match.pathname</code> in a splat route now includes the portion of the pathname matched by the <code>*</code>. This makes the <code>*</code> param behave much more like other dynamic <code>:id</code>-style params.</li>\n<li>Resolution of relative <code>&lt;Link&gt;</code>s in splat routes is changed now because the entire pathname that was matched by that route is now different (see previous bullet). Instead of resolving relative to the portion of the pathname before the <code>*</code>, paths resolve relative to the full pathname that was matched by the route.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>💻 Installing</h2>\n<p>Development for v6 is chugging along <a href=\"https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/tree/dev\">on the <code>dev</code> branch</a>.</p>\n<p>If you'd like to test it out, install from npm:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight highlight-source-shell notranslate position-relative overflow-auto\" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content=\"$ npm install history react-router-dom@next\"><pre>$ npm install <span class=\"pl-c1\">history</span> react-router-dom@next</pre></div>\n      </li>\n      <li>\n        <b>6.0.0-beta.4</b> - <a href=\"https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/releases/tag/v6.0.0-beta.4\">2021-09-11</a></br><p>Last week we released a lot of nice little bug features, but we did get a little carried away and let a little bug slip through with relative path resolution.

Let's dive in…</p>\n<h2>🐛 Bugfixes</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Path resolution for nested relative routes was broken in the last release and should now be fixed.

This is great for people who write their apps like this, but <strong>it technically could cause some breakage</strong> if you were using absolute paths (that start with <code>/</code>) in nested routes in previous betas. To fix this, simply <strong>remove the <code>/</code> from the beginning of any route paths that are meant to be relative</strong>. React Router will throw an error if you are using absolute paths that don't match their parent route paths. Hopefully this should help you find them if you are upgrading.</p>\n<p>If you were using <code>&lt;Route path=\"/\"&gt;</code> to indicate an index route, you can now use the new <code>&lt;Route index&gt;</code> prop to accomplish the same thing. The <code>index</code> prop makes it easy to scan a route config to find the index route. It also provides a guarantee that nobody will ever add children to that route.</p>\n<p>Here's the same route config as the one above, but rewritten with relative paths and the <code>index</code> prop:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight highlight-source-tsx notranslate position-relative overflow-auto\" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content=\"function UsersRoutes() {\n  return (\n    &lt;Routes&gt;\n      &lt;Route path=&quot;users&quot; element={&lt;UsersLayout /&gt;}&gt;\n        &lt;Route index element={&lt;UsersIndex /&gt;} /&gt;\n        &lt;Route path=&quot;:id&quot; element={&lt;UserProfile /&gt;} /&gt;\n      &lt;/Route&gt;\n    &lt;/Routes&gt;\n  );\n}\"><pre><span class=\"pl-k\">function</span> <span class=\"pl-smi\">UsersRoutes</span><span class=\"pl-kos\">(</span><span class=\"pl-kos\">)</span> <span class=\"pl-kos\">{</span>\n  <span class=\"pl-k\">return</span> <span class=\"pl-kos\">(</span>\n    <span class=\"pl-c1\">&lt;</span><span class=\"pl-smi\">Routes</span><span class=\"pl-c1\">&gt;</span>\n      <span class=\"pl-c1\">&lt;</span><span class=\"pl-smi\">Route</span> <span class=\"pl-c1\">path</span><span class=\"pl-c1\">=</span><span class=\"pl-s\">\"users\"</span> <span class=\"pl-c1\">element</span><span class=\"pl-c1\">=</span><span class=\"pl-kos\">{</span><span class=\"pl-c1\">&lt;</span><span class=\"pl-smi\">UsersLayout</span> <span class=\"pl-c1\">/</span><span class=\"pl-c1\">&gt;</span><span class=\"pl-kos\">}</span><span class=\"pl-c1\">&gt;</span>\n        <span class=\"pl-c1\">&lt;</span><span class=\"pl-smi\">Route</span> <span class=\"pl-c1\">index</span> <span class=\"pl-c1\">element</span><span class=\"pl-c1\">=</span><span class=\"pl-kos\">{</span><span class=\"pl-c1\">&lt;</span><span class=\"pl-smi\">UsersIndex</span> <span class=\"pl-c1\">/</span><span class=\"pl-c1\">&gt;</span><span class=\"pl-kos\">}</span> <span class=\"pl-c1\">/</span><span class=\"pl-c1\">&gt;</span>\n        <span class=\"pl-c1\">&lt;</span><span class=\"pl-smi\">Route</span> <span class=\"pl-c1\">path</span><span class=\"pl-c1\">=</span><span class=\"pl-s\">\":id\"</span> <span class=\"pl-c1\">element</span><span class=\"pl-c1\">=</span><span class=\"pl-kos\">{</span><span class=\"pl-c1\">&lt;</span><span class=\"pl-smi\">UserProfile</span> <span class=\"pl-c1\">/</span><span class=\"pl-c1\">&gt;</span><span class=\"pl-kos\">}</span> <span class=\"pl-c1\">/</span><span class=\"pl-c1\">&gt;</span>\n      <span class=\"pl-c1\">&lt;</span><span class=\"pl-c1\">/</span><span class=\"pl-smi\">Route</span><span class=\"pl-c1\">&gt;</span>\n    <span class=\"pl-c1\">&lt;</span><span class=\"pl-c1\">/</span><span class=\"pl-smi\">Routes</span><span class=\"pl-c1\">&gt;</span>\n  <span class=\"pl-kos\">)</span><span class=\"pl-kos\">;</span>\n<span class=\"pl-kos\">}</span></pre></div>\n<p>A lot of our work on React Router is about doing the <strong>least surprising</strong> thing for our users.

There's a few major breaking changes in this release so read carefully.</p>\n<p><strong>Breaking changes:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>The function returned by <code>compile</code> only accepts strings as values (i.e. no numbers, use <code>String(value)</code> before compiling a path)\n<ul>\n<li>For repeated values, when <code>encode !== false</code>, it must be an array of strings</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Parameter names can contain all unicode identifier characters (defined as regex <code>\\p{XID_Continue}</code>).</li>\n<li>Modifiers (<code>?</code>, <code>*</code>, <code>+</code>) must be used after a param explicitly wrapped in <code>{}</code>\n<ul>\n<li>No more implied prefix of <code>/</code> or <code>.</code></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>No support for arrays or regexes as inputs</li>\n<li>The wildcard (standalone <code>*</code>) has been added back and matches Express.js expected behavior</li>\n<li>Removed <code>endsWith</code> option</li>\n<li>Renamed <code>strict: true</code> to <code>trailing: false</code></li>\n<li>Reserved <code>;</code>, <code>,</code>, <code>!</code>, and <code>@</code> for future use-cases</li>\n<li>Removed <code>tokensToRegexp</code>, <code>tokensToFunction</code> and <code>regexpToFunction</code> in favor of simplifying exports</li>\n<li>Enable a \"loose\" mode by default, so <code>/</code> can be repeated multiple times in a matched path (i.e. <code>/foo</code> works like <code>//foo</code>, etc)</li>\n<li><code>encode</code> and <code>decode</code> no longer receive the token as the second parameter</li>\n<li>Removed the ESM + CommonJS dual package in favor of only one CommonJS supported export</li>\n<li>Minimum JS support for ES2020 (previous ES2015)</li>\n<li>Encode defaults to <code>encodeURIComponent</code> and decode defaults to <code>decodeURIComponent</code></li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Added:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Adds <code>encodePath</code> to fix an issue around <code>encode</code> being used for both path and parameters (the path and parameter should be encoded slightly differently)</li>\n<li>Adds <code>loose</code> as an option to support arbitrarily matching the delimiter in paths, e.g. <code>foo/bar</code> and <code>foo///bar</code> should work the same</li>\n<li>Allow <code>encode</code> and <code>decode</code> to be set to <code>false</code> which skips all processing of the parameters input/output</li>\n<li>All remaining methods support <code>TokenData</code> (exported, returned by <code>parse</code>) as input\n<ul>\n<li>This should be useful if you are programmatically building paths to match or want to avoid parsing multiple times</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Requests for feedback:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Requiring <code>{}</code> is an obvious drawback but I'm seeking feedback on whether it helps make path behavior clearer\n<ul>\n<li>Related: Removing <code>/</code> and <code>.</code> as implicit prefixes</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Removing array and regex support is to reduce the overall package size for things many users don't need</li>\n<li>Unicode IDs are added to align more closely with browser URLPattern behavior, which uses JS identifiers</li>\n</ul>\n<p><a class=\"commit-link\" href=\"https://github.com/pillarjs/path-to-regexp/compare/v6.2.2...v7.0.0\"><tt>v6.2.2...v7.0.0</tt></a></p>\n      </li>\n      <li>\n        <b>6.2.2</b> - <a href=\"https://github.com/pillarjs/path-to-regexp/releases/tag/v6.2.2\">2024-04-07</a></br><p>No API changes.

But it's coming very soon, we promise! In the mean time, here's what you'll get from our eight-est and greatest beta release:</p>\n<h2>🐛 Bug Fixes</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>We fixed a few bugs in <code>useHref</code> that resulted in the incorrect resolved value in cases where a <code>basename</code> is used on the <code>&lt;Router /&gt;</code> component (See <a href=\"https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/issues/8133\" data-hovercard-type=\"issue\" data-hovercard-url=\"/remix-run/react-router/issues/8133/hovercard\">#8133</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/issues/8142\" data-hovercard-type=\"issue\" data-hovercard-url=\"/remix-run/react-router/issues/8142/hovercard\">#8142</a> for details).</li>\n<li>We also fixed a bug in our path ranking algorithm so that splat routes (routes with a <code>*</code> path value) are now correctly ranked ahead of layout routes.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>🗒️ Docs</h2>\n<p>We've added lots of goodies to our <code>docs</code> and <code>examples</code>, and there's a lot more yet to come. Take a look and see if you find something that makes your work a little easier! We think the <a href=\"https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/tree/dev/examples/lazy-loading\">lazy loading</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/tree/dev/examples/custom-query-parsing\">custom query parsing</a> examples are particularly cool! 🤓</p>\n      </li>\n      <li>\n        <b>6.0.0-beta.7</b> - <a href=\"https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/releases/tag/v6.0.0-beta.7\">2021-10-15</a></br><p>In this release we made a small but significant change to how <code>&lt;Link to=\"..\"&gt;</code> works. This is going to help out a lot if you were trying to use links in a <code>*</code> route.</p>\n<p>We have also backed out our blocking/prompt APIs for the stable v6 release. We will revisit this post 6.0 when we have a little more time to get it right.</p>\n<h2>✨ Features</h2>\n<p>The major change in this release could also be classified as a bugfix or a breaking change, depending on how you look at it. We essentialy altered the way <code>&lt;Link to=\"..\"&gt;</code> works. See <a class=\"issue-link js-issue-link\" data-error-text=\"Failed to load title\" data-id=\"1011480834\" data-permission-text=\"Title is private\" data-url=\"https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/issues/8086\" data-hovercard-type=\"issue\" data-hovercard-url=\"/remix-run/react-router/issues/8086/hovercard\" href=\"https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/issues/8086\">#8086</a> for the motivation behind this change.</p>\n<p>You'll probably want to reread <a href=\"https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/blob/main/docs/guides/migrating-5-to-6.md#note-on-link-to-values\">the section in the v5 =&gt; v6 migration guide about <code>&lt;Link to&gt;</code> values</a> (it has been updated), but it basically boils down to this: <strong>any leading <code>..</code> segment in a <code>&lt;Link to&gt;</code> value traverses \"up\" one route and builds upon that route's path instead of just removing one URL segment</strong>. This feature really completes the story of relative routes and links.</p>\n<p>We could consider this a bugfix, since this is how it was always intended to work in the first place. Without it, you'd have a difficult time linking predictably in <code>*</code> routes because your <code>&lt;a href&gt;</code> would be different depending on the number of segments in the current URL.</p>\n<p>The reason this could also be considered a breaking change is that <code>..</code> now works slightly differently in <code>&lt;Link to&gt;</code> than it would in <code>&lt;a href&gt;</code>. When you have <code>&lt;a href=\"..\"&gt;</code> it operates on the URL pathname, removing one segment of the current URL. However, since many routes really only match a single segment of the URL, there is often no difference between <code>&lt;Link to=\"..\"&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;a href=\"..\"&gt;</code>.</p>\n<h2>💔 Breaking Changes</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>We removed <code>useBlocker()</code>, <code>usePrompt()</code>, and <code>&lt;Prompt&gt;</code> for now. We will revisit these post 6.0 when we have more time to get it right. But we don't want it to <em>block</em> (see what I did there) the release of all the other awesome stuff we've got in v6.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>🛠 Roadmap</h2>\n<p>We anticipate this will be the last beta release before v6 stable next week. Please give it a shot and let us know how it goes!</p>\n<h2>👍 Upgrading</h2>\n<p>If you're thinking about upgrading to v6, I published a few notes this past week that may help you:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://gist.github.com/mjackson/b5748add2795ce7448a366ae8f8ae3bb\">This note talks about removing <code>&lt;Redirect&gt;</code> elements from any <code>&lt;Switch&gt;</code>es you may have in your v5 app</a> and how you can get better SEO in the process if you're currently relying on client-side redirects.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://gist.github.com/mjackson/d54b40a094277b7afdd6b81f51a0393f\">This note talks about how to refactor your code to avoid \"wrapping\" <code>&lt;Route&gt;</code> elements</a>, which won't work in v6.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Both of those posts contain steps you can take <strong>today in your v5 app</strong> without upgrading to v6.</p>\n<p>We are also developing a backwards compat lib that should help some of you upgrade from v5 to v6. We'll post more about this when it's ready.</p>\n<h2>💻 Installing</h2>\n<p>Development for v6 has switched from <code>dev</code> <a href=\"https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/tree/main\">to the <code>main</code> branch</a>.</p>\n<p>If you'd like to test it out, install from npm:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight highlight-source-shell notranslate position-relative overflow-auto\" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content=\"$ npm install history react-router-dom@next\"><pre>$ npm install <span class=\"pl-c1\">history</span> react-router-dom@next</pre></div>\n      </li>\n      <li>\n        <b>6.0.0-beta.6</b> - <a href=\"https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/releases/tag/v6.0.0-beta.6\">2021-10-07</a></br><p>No big enhancements in this release, just squashing bugs and writing lots of tests! Also, we are hard at work on cranking out examples for v6. See the end of this post for an update on our roadmap between here and v6 stable.</p>\n<h2>🧰 Examples</h2>\n<p>We have begun creating some examples for v6 that we hope will help developers make effective use of all the new features we have. So far, we have examples for the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/tree/dev/examples/basic\">Basic Example</a> – A basic client-side app for v6 showing how to use nested routes, layouts, links, and the new <code>&lt;Outlet&gt;</code> API</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/tree/dev/examples/auth\">Auth Example</a> – Demonstrates an authentication flow including using the new <code>useNavigate()</code> hook, the <code>&lt;Navigate&gt;</code> element, and <code>location.state</code></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/tree/dev/examples/search-params\">Search Params Example</a> – Demonstrates how to build a simple search form that uses the new <code>useSearchParams()</code> hook</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/tree/dev/examples/ssr\">SSR Example</a> – A server-rendered app that uses <code>&lt;StaticRouter&gt;</code> on the server and uses a <code>&lt;BrowserRouter&gt;</code> with <code>ReactDOM.hydrate()</code> on the client</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Each example includes a button in the README that allows you to instantly launch a running instance on StackBlitz that you can play with. We hope you enjoy exploring!</p>\n<h2>🐛  Bugfixes</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Make <code>&lt;NavLink&gt;</code> match only whole URL segments instead of pieces. This means that <code>&lt;NavLink to=\"/home/users\"&gt;</code> will still be active at <code>/home/users</code>, but not at <code>/home/users2</code>. See <a class=\"issue-link js-issue-link\" data-error-text=\"Failed to load title\" data-id=\"667165091\" data-permission-text=\"Title is private\" data-url=\"https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/issues/7523\" data-hovercard-type=\"issue\" data-hovercard-url=\"/remix-run/react-router/issues/7523/hovercard\" href=\"https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/issues/7523\">#7523</a></li>\n<li>Makes \"layout routes\" (routes with no <code>path</code>) never match unless one of their children do. See <a class=\"issue-link js-issue-link\" data-error-text=\"Failed to load title\" data-id=\"1011333475\" data-permission-text=\"Title is private\" data-url=\"https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/issues/8085\" data-hovercard-type=\"issue\" data-hovercard-url=\"/remix-run/react-router/issues/8085/hovercard\" href=\"https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/issues/8085\">#8085</a></li>\n<li>Fixes a route matching regression with splat routes that was introduced in beta.5. See <a class=\"issue-link js-issue-link\" data-error-text=\"Failed to load title\" data-id=\"1007185501\" data-permission-text=\"Title is private\" data-url=\"https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/issues/8072\" data-hovercard-type=\"issue\" data-hovercard-url=\"/remix-run/react-router/issues/8072/hovercard\" href=\"https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/issues/8072\">#8072</a> and <a class=\"issue-link js-issue-link\" data-error-text=\"Failed to load title\" data-id=\"1016281961\" data-permission-text=\"Title is private\" data-url=\"https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/issues/8109\" data-hovercard-type=\"issue\" data-hovercard-url=\"/remix-run/react-router/issues/8109/hovercard\" href=\"https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/issues/8109\">#8109</a></li>\n<li>Fixes matching a nested splat route. See <a class=\"commit-link\" data-hovercard-type=\"commit\" data-hovercard-url=\"https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/commit/af7d038eb308bbf6580565883f3195b6dce693cf/hovercard\" href=\"https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/commit/af7d038eb308bbf6580565883f3195b6dce693cf\"><tt>af7d038</tt></a></li>\n<li>Provide all parent route params to descendant <code>&lt;Routes&gt;</code>. This reverses a decision that we made in beta.5 to remove them. See <a class=\"issue-link js-issue-link\" data-error-text=\"Failed to load title\" data-id=\"1007299738\" data-permission-text=\"Title is private\" data-url=\"https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/issues/8073\" data-hovercard-type=\"issue\" data-hovercard-url=\"/remix-run/react-router/issues/8073/hovercard\" href=\"https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/issues/8073\">#8073</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>💔 Breaking Changes</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Splats in route paths (<code>*</code>) match only after a <code>/</code> in the URL. This means that <code>&lt;Route path=\"files*\"&gt;</code> will always match as if it were <code>&lt;Route path=\"files/*\"&gt;</code>. The router will issue a warning if your route path ends with <code>*</code> but not <code>/*</code></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>🛠 Roadmap</h2>\n<p>We are very close to a stable release! The last big code changes we need to make are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Fixing \"linking up\". Currently a <code>&lt;Link to=\"..\"&gt;</code> operates on the URL pathname. However, this makes it difficult to link to the parent route when you're in a splat route. See <a class=\"issue-link js-issue-link\" data-error-text=\"Failed to load title\" data-id=\"1011480834\" data-permission-text=\"Title is private\" data-url=\"https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/issues/8086\" data-hovercard-type=\"issue\" data-hovercard-url=\"/remix-run/react-router/issues/8086/hovercard\" href=\"https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/issues/8086\">#8086</a>. This will be a breaking change.</li>\n<li>We are going to remove <code>useBlocker()</code> and <code>&lt;Prompt&gt;</code> in our initial v6 release, with plans to revisit them and possibly add them back at some point in the future. I still need to write up something here that explains our rationale. This will also be a breaking change.</li>\n<li>We are going to add some animation primitives (see <a class=\"issue-link js-issue-link\" data-error-text=\"Failed to load title\" data-id=\"3555633\" data-permission-text=\"Title is private\" data-url=\"https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/discussions/8008\" data-hovercard-type=\"discussion\" data-hovercard-url=\"/remix-run/react-router/discussions/8008/hovercard\" href=\"https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/discussions/8008\">#8008</a>). The <code>&lt;Routes location&gt;</code> prop will be in v6, but it isn't ideal for animation.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>💻 Installing</h2>\n<p>Development for v6 is chugging along <a href=\"https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/tree/dev\">on the <code>dev</code> branch</a>.</p>\n<p>If you'd like to test it out, install from npm:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight highlight-source-shell notranslate position-relative overflow-auto\" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content=\"$ npm install history react-router-dom@next\"><pre>$ npm install <span class=\"pl-c1\">history</span> react-router-dom@next</pre></div>\n      </li>\n      <li>\n        <b>6.0.0-beta.5</b> - <a href=\"https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/releases/tag/v6.0.0-beta.5\">2021-09-25</a></br><p>This week's release adds some much-needed polish to a few niche features of the router: splat routes (a route that uses a <code>*</code> path) and basenames. It also adds a <code>renderMatches</code> API that completes the story for those of you who may have been using <code>react-router-config</code> in v4 and v5.</p>\n<h2>🐛  Bugfixes</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>A <code>*</code> in a child route path matches <em>after</em> a slash following its parent route path. This fixes some situations where the <code>*</code> was overly greedy (see <a class=\"issue-link js-issue-link\" data-error-text=\"Failed to load title\" data-id=\"977000696\" data-permission-text=\"Title is private\" data-url=\"https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/issues/7972\" data-hovercard-type=\"issue\" data-hovercard-url=\"/remix-run/react-router/issues/7972/hovercard\" href=\"https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/issues/7972\">#7972</a>)</li>\n<li>Resolution of <code>&lt;Link to=\".\"&gt;</code> and <code>useResolvedPath(\".\")</code> values are fixed in splat routes. Previously these resolved relative to the parent route's path. They now resolve relative to the path of the route that rendered them.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>✨  Enhancements</h2>\n<p>This release makes it easier to work with apps that have multiple entry points. Using the <code>&lt;Router basename&gt;</code> prop allows React Router to be easily deployed on only a portion of a larger site by using a portion of the URL pathname (the \"basename\") to transparently prefix all route paths and link navigations.</p>\n<p>For example, you can deploy one React Router app at the <code>/inbox</code> URL prefix, and another one at the <code>/admin</code> prefix. These base URLs represent two different entry points into your app, each with its own bundles. The rest of your site, including the root / URL could be rendered by something other than React Router, for example by your server framework of choice.</p>\n<p>In the bundle for each entry point, simply initialize React Router with the basename of that entry point.</p>\n<div class=\"highlight highlight-source-tsx notranslate position-relative overflow-auto\" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content=\"&lt;Router basename=&quot;/inbox&quot;&gt;\n  // ...\n&lt;/Router&gt;\"><pre><span class=\"pl-c1\">&lt;</span><span class=\"pl-smi\">Router</span> <span class=\"pl-c1\">basename</span><span class=\"pl-c1\">=</span><span class=\"pl-s\">\"/inbox\"</span><span class=\"pl-c1\">&gt;</span>\n  // ...\n<span class=\"pl-c1\">&lt;</span><span class=\"pl-c1\">/</span><span class=\"pl-smi\">Router</span><span class=\"pl-c1\">&gt;</span></pre></div>\n<p>Then define your routes and link paths without using the <code>/inbox</code> URL prefix in any of them. The entire app will run relative to that prefix.</p>\n<p>Another improvement in this release is the addition of the <code>renderMatches</code> API, which is the complement of <code>matchRoutes</code>. These APIs are both very low-level and should not normally be needed. But they are sometimes nice to use if you are doing your own data loading using the array of <code>matches</code> that you get back from <code>matchRoutes</code>.</p>\n<p><code>matchRoutes</code> and <code>renderMatches</code> are the equivalent of the <code>react-router-config</code> package we shipped in v4 and v5, just built directly into the router instead of in a separate package.</p>\n<h2>💔 Breaking Changes</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><code>&lt;Routes basename&gt;</code> has moved to <code>&lt;Router basename&gt;</code>. This prop is also available on all router variants (<code>&lt;BrowserRouter&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;HashRouter&gt;</code>, etc.).</li>\n<li><code>useLocation().pathname</code> no longer includes the basename, if present.</li>\n<li>The <code>basename</code> argument was removed from <code>useRoutes</code>. This reverts the signature to <code>useRoutes(routes, location)</code>, same as it was previous to beta.4.</li>\n<li>Descendant <code>&lt;Routes&gt;</code> do not get the params from their parents. This helps a set of <code>&lt;Routes&gt;</code> to be more portable by decoupling it from the params of its parents and makes it easier to know which params will be returned from <code>useParams()</code>. If you were relying on this behavior previously, you'll need to pass along the params manually to the elements rendered by the descendant <code>&lt;Routes&gt;</code>. See <a href=\"https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/issues/8073#issuecomment-929687218\" data-hovercard-type=\"issue\" data-hovercard-url=\"/remix-run/react-router/issues/8073/hovercard\">this comment</a> for an example of how this is to be done and for a potential workaround if you really need the old behavior.</li>\n<li><code>match.pathname</code> in a splat route now includes the portion of the pathname matched by the <code>*</code>. This makes the <code>*</code> param behave much more like other dynamic <code>:id</code>-style params.</li>\n<li>Resolution of relative <code>&lt;Link&gt;</code>s in splat routes is changed now because the entire pathname that was matched by that route is now different (see previous bullet). Instead of resolving relative to the portion of the pathname before the <code>*</code>, paths resolve relative to the full pathname that was matched by the route.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>💻 Installing</h2>\n<p>Development for v6 is chugging along <a href=\"https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/tree/dev\">on the <code>dev</code> branch</a>.</p>\n<p>If you'd like to test it out, install from npm:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight highlight-source-shell notranslate position-relative overflow-auto\" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content=\"$ npm install history react-router-dom@next\"><pre>$ npm install <span class=\"pl-c1\">history</span> react-router-dom@next</pre></div>\n      </li>\n      <li>\n        <b>6.0.0-beta.4</b> - <a href=\"https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/releases/tag/v6.0.0-beta.4\">2021-09-11</a></br><p>Last week we released a lot of nice little bug features, but we did get a little carried away and let a little bug slip through with relative path resolution.

Let's dive in…</p>\n<h2>🐛 Bugfixes</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Path resolution for nested relative routes was broken in the last release and should now be fixed.

This is great for people who write their apps like this, but <strong>it technically could cause some breakage</strong> if you were using absolute paths (that start with <code>/</code>) in nested routes in previous betas. To fix this, simply <strong>remove the <code>/</code> from the beginning of any route paths that are meant to be relative</strong>. React Router will throw an error if you are using absolute paths that don't match their parent route paths. Hopefully this should help you find them if you are upgrading.</p>\n<p>If you were using <code>&lt;Route path=\"/\"&gt;</code> to indicate an index route, you can now use the new <code>&lt;Route index&gt;</code> prop to accomplish the same thing. The <code>index</code> prop makes it easy to scan a route config to find the index route. It also provides a guarantee that nobody will ever add children to that route.</p>\n<p>Here's the same route config as the one above, but rewritten with relative paths and the <code>index</code> prop:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight highlight-source-tsx notranslate position-relative overflow-auto\" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content=\"function UsersRoutes() {\n  return (\n    &lt;Routes&gt;\n      &lt;Route path=&quot;users&quot; element={&lt;UsersLayout /&gt;}&gt;\n        &lt;Route index element={&lt;UsersIndex /&gt;} /&gt;\n        &lt;Route path=&quot;:id&quot; element={&lt;UserProfile /&gt;} /&gt;\n      &lt;/Route&gt;\n    &lt;/Routes&gt;\n  );\n}\"><pre><span class=\"pl-k\">function</span> <span class=\"pl-smi\">UsersRoutes</span><span class=\"pl-kos\">(</span><span class=\"pl-kos\">)</span> <span class=\"pl-kos\">{</span>\n  <span class=\"pl-k\">return</span> <span class=\"pl-kos\">(</span>\n    <span class=\"pl-c1\">&lt;</span><span class=\"pl-smi\">Routes</span><span class=\"pl-c1\">&gt;</span>\n      <span class=\"pl-c1\">&lt;</span><span class=\"pl-smi\">Route</span> <span class=\"pl-c1\">path</span><span class=\"pl-c1\">=</span><span class=\"pl-s\">\"users\"</span> <span class=\"pl-c1\">element</span><span class=\"pl-c1\">=</span><span class=\"pl-kos\">{</span><span class=\"pl-c1\">&lt;</span><span class=\"pl-smi\">UsersLayout</span> <span class=\"pl-c1\">/</span><span class=\"pl-c1\">&gt;</span><span class=\"pl-kos\">}</span><span class=\"pl-c1\">&gt;</span>\n        <span class=\"pl-c1\">&lt;</span><span class=\"pl-smi\">Route</span> <span class=\"pl-c1\">index</span> <span class=\"pl-c1\">element</span><span class=\"pl-c1\">=</span><span class=\"pl-kos\">{</span><span class=\"pl-c1\">&lt;</span><span class=\"pl-smi\">UsersIndex</span> <span class=\"pl-c1\">/</span><span class=\"pl-c1\">&gt;</span><span class=\"pl-kos\">}</span> <span class=\"pl-c1\">/</span><span class=\"pl-c1\">&gt;</span>\n        <span class=\"pl-c1\">&lt;</span><span class=\"pl-smi\">Route</span> <span class=\"pl-c1\">path</span><span class=\"pl-c1\">=</span><span class=\"pl-s\">\":id\"</span> <span class=\"pl-c1\">element</span><span class=\"pl-c1\">=</span><span class=\"pl-kos\">{</span><span class=\"pl-c1\">&lt;</span><span class=\"pl-smi\">UserProfile</span> <span class=\"pl-c1\">/</span><span class=\"pl-c1\">&gt;</span><span class=\"pl-kos\">}</span> <span class=\"pl-c1\">/</span><span class=\"pl-c1\">&gt;</span>\n      <span class=\"pl-c1\">&lt;</span><span class=\"pl-c1\">/</span><span class=\"pl-smi\">Route</span><span class=\"pl-c1\">&gt;</span>\n    <span class=\"pl-c1\">&lt;</span><span class=\"pl-c1\">/</span><span class=\"pl-smi\">Routes</span><span class=\"pl-c1\">&gt;</span>\n  <span class=\"pl-kos\">)</span><span class=\"pl-kos\">;</span>\n<span class=\"pl-kos\">}</span></pre></div>\n<p>A lot of our work on React Router is about doing the <strong>least surprising</strong> thing for our users. Allowing absolute paths in nested routes gets us a little closer to that goal!</p>\n<h2>💔 Breaking Changes</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Removed the ability for nested route paths to begin with a <code>/</code> and not contain the complete path of their parent routes. This was necessary in order to introduce support for absolute paths in nested routes, described in detail above</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Removed the <code>createRoutesFromArray</code> utility function. You can now pass your routes directly to <code>useRoutes</code> or <code>matchRoutes</code> without passing it through <code>createRoutesFromArray</code> first</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Removed the <code>PartialRouteObject</code> type. If you were importing and using this type before, use <code>RouteObject</code> instead, which has been updated to make all properties optional</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The <code>useRoutes</code> API has changed slightly.
