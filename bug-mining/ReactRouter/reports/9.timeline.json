this is how I managed to use ReactTransitionGroup `react-addons-transition-group` (see React docs) with React Router v4:\n\n**App.js**\n\n``` js\nimport React from 'react';\nimport Router from 'react-router/BrowserRouter';\nimport Match from 'react-router/Match';\nimport Link from 'react-router/Link';\n\n// new\nimport AnimatedMatch from './AnimatedMatch';\n\nconst App = () => (\n  <Router>\n    <div>\n      <ul>\n        <li><Link to=\"/\">Home</Link></li>\n        <li><Link to=\"/about\">About</Link></li>\n        <li><Link to=\"/topics\">Topics</Link></li>\n      </ul>\n\n      <hr/>\n\n      <AnimatedMatch exactly pattern=\"/\" component={Home} />\n      <AnimatedMatch pattern=\"/about\" component={About} />\n      <AnimatedMatch pattern=\"/topics\" component={Topics} />\n    </div>\n  </Router>\n);\n\nconst Home = () => (\n  <div>\n    <h2>Home</h2>\n  </div>\n);\n\nconst About = () => (\n  <div>\n    <h2>About</h2>\n  </div>\n);\n\nconst Topics = () => (\n  <div>\n    <h2>Topics</h2>\n  </div>\n)\n```\n\nThis is basically the Basic Example from the current docs, i only just replaced the `Match` Component with a custom `AnimatedMatch` component.\n\n**AnimatedMatch.js**\n\n``` js\nimport React, { Component } from 'react';\nimport Match from 'react-router/Match';\nimport TransitionGroup from 'react-addons-transition-group'; // here comes the magic\nimport Page from './Page'; // new\n\nexport default class AnimatedMatch extends Component {\n  render() {\n    const data = this.props;\n\n    return (<Match\n      {...this.props}\n      children={({ matched, ...props }) => {\n        return (<TransitionGroup>\n          {matched && <Page>\n            <data.component {...props} />\n          </Page>}\n        </TransitionGroup>);\n      }}\n    />);\n  }\n}\n```\n\nHere I basically render the React-Router v4 `Match` Component and make use of the `children` prop to wrap our actual desired component `data.component` (in that case) with a `TransitionGroup` to set up the component with hooks to animate the underlying DOM.\nFor that matter we will need another component where we can define those hooks `Page.js`.\n\n**Page.js**\n\n``` js\nimport React, { Component } from 'react';\nimport { findDOMNode } from 'react-dom';\n\nexport default class Page extends Component {\n  componentWillEnter(cb) {\n    // animate stuff, then call cb();\n    const element = findDOMNode(this);\n    cb();\n  }\n\n  componentWillLeave(cb) {\n    // animate stuff, then call cb();\n    const element = findDOMNode(this);\n    cb();\n  }\n\n  render() {\n    return this.props.children;\n  }\n}\n```\n\nHere I only render the `children` which is actually our desired `component` from the `Match` and set up hooks like `componentWillEnter` and `componentWillLeave`. For more infos on this API take a look at the `official react docs` **React Transition Group**.\n\nI don't really have the time to make a full PR,\nbut I think this pretty much solves it and is a good example for some practical usage.\n\nHope it helps @HofmannZ :)\n","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/remix-run/react-router/issues/comments/252525744/reactions","total_count":9,"+1":5,"-1":0,"laugh":1,"hooray":2,"confused":0,"heart":1,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"stnwk","id":2981250,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5ODEyNTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2981250?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/stnwk","html_url":"https://github.com/stnwk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stnwk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stnwk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stnwk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stnwk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stnwk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stnwk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stnwk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stnwk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stnwk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":817520845,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50ODE3NTIwODQ1","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/remix-run/react-router/issues/events/817520845","actor":{"login":"HofmannZ","id":17142193,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MTQyMTkz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17142193?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HofmannZ","html_url":"https://github.com/HofmannZ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HofmannZ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HofmannZ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HofmannZ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HofmannZ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HofmannZ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HofmannZ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HofmannZ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HofmannZ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HofmannZ/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2016-10-10T01:14:34Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":817520846,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDgxNzUyMDg0Ng==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/remix-run/react-router/issues/events/817520846","actor":{"login":"HofmannZ","id":17142193,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MTQyMTkz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17142193?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HofmannZ","html_url":"https://github.com/HofmannZ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HofmannZ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HofmannZ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HofmannZ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HofmannZ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HofmannZ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HofmannZ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HofmannZ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HofmannZ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HofmannZ/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2016-10-10T01:14:34Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/remix-run/react-router/issues/comments/252631885","html_url":"https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/issues/3936#issuecomment-252631885","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/remix-run/react-router/issues/3936","id":252631885,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI1MjYzMTg4NQ==","user":{"login":"HofmannZ","id":17142193,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MTQyMTkz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17142193?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HofmannZ","html_url":"https://github.com/HofmannZ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HofmannZ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HofmannZ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HofmannZ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HofmannZ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HofmannZ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HofmannZ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HofmannZ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HofmannZ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HofmannZ/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-10-10T14:10:08Z","updated_at":"2016-10-10T14:10:08Z","body":"Hmm
