Create a Router`, there's an example that defines a route with the path `\"shows/:showId\"`. However, inside the `loader` function, the code incorrectly uses `params.id` instead of `params.showId`.\n\n#### Current code:\n```tsx\nloader: ({ request, params }) =>\n  fetch(`/api/show/${params.id}.json`, {\n    signal: request.signal,\n  }),\n```\n#### Correct code:\n```tsx\nloader: ({ request, params }) =>\n  fetch(`/api/show/${params.showId}.json`, {\n    signal: request.signal,\n  }),\n```\n\nThe dynamic segment in the path is :showId, so params.showId should be used to retrieve its value. params.id would be undefined in this case.\n\n [Page](https://reactrouter.com/start/data/custom#1-create-a-router)","closed_by":{"login":"timdorr","id":17882,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3ODgy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17882?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/timdorr","html_url":"https://github.com/timdorr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timdorr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timdorr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timdorr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timdorr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timdorr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timdorr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timdorr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timdorr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/timdorr/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/remix-run/react-router/issues/13680/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/remix-run/react-router/issues/13680/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
