A few options:\r\n\r\n1. Move the code back to reactjs/react-router-redux\r\n2. Move the code into a new read-only repo at ReactTraining/react-router-redux\r\n3. Move the code into reduxjs/react-router-redux\r\n4. Move the code under @timdorr's personal GitHub\r\n\r\nI personally feel that option 2 is probably the best since I don't want to clutter up the reactjs or reduxjs orgs with our old, deprecated code. But I'd be fine with any of the options. I just want the code out of this repo so it doesn't run when we run tests.\r\n\r\nOf course, wherever the code lives we should link to it from our README and let people know where it is.\r\n\r\nWhat do you think @timdorr ?","closed_by":{"login":"mjackson","id":92839,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyODM5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/92839?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjackson","html_url":"https://github.com/mjackson","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjackson/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjackson/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjackson/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjackson/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjackson/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjackson/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjackson/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjackson/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjackson/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/remix-run/react-router/issues/6358/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/remix-run/react-router/issues/6358/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
