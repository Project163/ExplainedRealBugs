Have a router with future `v7_relativeSplatPath` set to `true`.\r\n2. Have an index/pathless layout route in the tree.\r\n3. Have a splat route as a child (doesn't have to be a direct child).\r\n4. Call `useResolvedPath('.')` in the splat route component.\r\n\r\nMinimal example:\r\nhttps://stackblitz.com/edit/github-9el7os?file=src%2Fapp.tsx\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nThe result of `useResolvedPath('.')` should include the splat.\r\n\r\n>When you enable the flag, this \"bug\" is fixed so that path resolution is consistent across all route types, and useResolvedPath(\".\") always resolves to the current pathname for the contextual route. This includes any dynamic param or splat param values.\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nThe result of `useResolvedPath('.')` is the `pathnameBase`, i.e. lacking the splat part.","closed_by":{"login":"brophdawg11","id":1609022,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MDkwMjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1609022?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/brophdawg11","html_url":"https://github.com/brophdawg11","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brophdawg11/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brophdawg11/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brophdawg11/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brophdawg11/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brophdawg11/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brophdawg11/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brophdawg11/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brophdawg11/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brophdawg11/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/remix-run/react-router/issues/11629/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/remix-run/react-router/issues/11629/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
