It doesn't seem to happen if there is no `/*`, e.g. `<Route path=\"cheeseburger\">`.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"chaance","id":3082153,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwODIxNTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3082153?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chaance","html_url":"https://github.com/chaance","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chaance/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chaance/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chaance/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chaance/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chaance/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chaance/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chaance/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chaance/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chaance/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/remix-run/react-router/issues/7529/reactions","total_count":10,"+1":10,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/remix-run/react-router/issues/7529/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
