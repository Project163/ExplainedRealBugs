However I'm still unsure of the reason for that default; it seems to me that a visible change in the URL should be undoable by pressing \"Back\" in general.\n\nThe default behavior of `<Redirect>` is modeled after server-side redirects (i.e. HTTP status 301 or 302) which do not add an entry to the browser's history. Since this is what most people think of when we say the word \"redirect\" we imitate this behavior so they aren't surprised.\n\nYou can test this behavior by going to https://unpkg.com and clicking on any un-versioned link (e.g. https://unpkg.com/react). This will issue a 302 redirect and take you to a URL that includes the latest React version (https://unpkg.com/react@15.3.2 as of this writing). When you click your back button, instead of being taken to https://unpkg.com/react you'll be taken back to https://unpkg.com because your browser didn't store an entry for https://unpkg.com/react in the history stack (it was a redirect!).\n\nFeel free to use that explanation in the docs if it makes sense to you :)\n","author_association":"MEMBER","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/remix-run/react-router/issues/comments/249943316/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"mjackson","id":92839,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyODM5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/92839?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjackson","html_url":"https://github.com/mjackson","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjackson/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjackson/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjackson/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjackson/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjackson/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjackson/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjackson/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjackson/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjackson/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":804276906,"node_id":"MDE3OlJlbmFtZWRUaXRsZUV2ZW50ODA0Mjc2OTA2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/remix-run/react-router/issues/events/804276906","actor":{"login":"mjackson","id":92839,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyODM5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/92839?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjackson","html_url":"https://github.com/mjackson","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjackson/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjackson/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjackson/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjackson/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjackson/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjackson/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjackson/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjackson/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjackson/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"renamed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2016-09-27T18:08:05Z","rename":{"from":"<Redirect> uses replaceWith rather than transitionTo (v4)","to":"Add <Redirect push> and <Link replace> to override defaults"},"performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/remix-run/react-router/issues/comments/249994341","html_url":"https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/issues/3903#issuecomment-249994341","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/remix-run/react-router/issues/3903","id":249994341,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDI0OTk5NDM0MQ==","user":{"login":"aaugustin","id":788910,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc4ODkxMA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/788910?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaugustin","html_url":"https://github.com/aaugustin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaugustin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaugustin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaugustin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaugustin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaugustin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaugustin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaugustin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaugustin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaugustin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-09-27T20:50:15Z","updated_at":"2016-09-27T20:50:46Z","body":"Thanks a lot for that explanation.\n\nThe parallel works in your example.\n\nI tried writing it down for my use case and eventually found out how it's supposed to work.\n\n_server-side app_\n\nUser clicks `<a href=\"/form\">`.\n1.

It's a good idea to pushState on form submissions in all cases: it will add an entry to the history like a failed POST submission does in a traditional app.\n\nConclusion: <Redirect> should come with a warning that you should only render in in reaction to something that did a `pushState`, and that state will be replaced by the post-redirect state.
