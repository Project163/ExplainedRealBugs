I found out about the NavLink component by looking at the code, it's not present in the documentation.\r\n\r\nIt works quite well, except when I want to use it in a navbar for nested routes, because the NavLink apply the active class if the url match partially and not exactly, it leads to multiple NavLink in my navbar having the active class at the same time.\r\n\r\nWhat do you think about adding a prop to control this behavior ?\r\n\r\nThanks !\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"mjackson","id":92839,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyODM5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/92839?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjackson","html_url":"https://github.com/mjackson","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjackson/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjackson/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjackson/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjackson/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjackson/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjackson/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjackson/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjackson/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mjackson/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/remix-run/react-router/issues/4411/reactions","total_count":7,"+1":7,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/remix-run/react-router/issues/4411/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
