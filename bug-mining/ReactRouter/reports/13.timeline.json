brought up in #4347 \r\n\r\nv3 ships with a \"module\" entry in package.json pointing to an `es/` build (still transpiled, but with the `import`/`export` statements left in tact). This allows bundlers like webpack 2 and rollup to implement tree-shaking (not possible in the standard build since the transpiled `require` calls can't be statically analyzed).\r\n\r\nThis is a really useful feature as it cuts down on bundle size significantly -- have you considered adding it to v4 as well?\r\n\r\nI realize that in v4, you can currently do:\r\n```js\r\nimport Link from 'react-router/Link'\r\nimport Redirect from 'react-router/Redirect'\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut it doesn't allow for further shaking within the lib code, and is quite a bit more verbose than:\r\n```js\r\nimport {Link, Redirect} from 'react-router'\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you're interested, I'm happy to work on a PR.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/remix-run/react-router/issues/4425/reactions","total_count":3,"+1":3,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/remix-run/react-router/issues/4425/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}},"event":"cross-referenced"},{"id":2085321163,"node_id":"MDExOkxvY2tlZEV2ZW50MjA4NTMyMTE2Mw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/remix-run/react-router/issues/events/2085321163","actor":{"login":"lock[bot]","id":33595554,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90MzM1OTU1NTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/in/6672?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lock%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/lock","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lock%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lock%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lock%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lock%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lock%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lock%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lock%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lock%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lock%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"locked","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2019-01-21T02:28:45Z","lock_reason":"resolved","performed_via_github_app":null}]
