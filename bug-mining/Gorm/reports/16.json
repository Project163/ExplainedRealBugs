This is quadratic complexity, which is quite bad if there is large number of rows (more than a few thousand).\r\n\r\nThis can be improved by storing field values of one set of results in a map with a string key, iterating through the field values/objects of the other set and looking for the same values in the map.","closed_by":{"login":"jinzhu","id":6843,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4NDM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6843?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinzhu","html_url":"https://github.com/jinzhu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinzhu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinzhu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinzhu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinzhu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinzhu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinzhu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinzhu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinzhu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinzhu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/go-gorm/gorm/issues/1672/reactions","total_count":5,"+1":5,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/go-gorm/gorm/issues/1672/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
