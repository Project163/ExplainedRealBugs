case. \r\n\r\nIf the primary key value is not set, the returned map or map list will be filled with a custom column \"@id\".\r\n\r\n### User Case Description\r\n\r\nThe following cases are all using **auto-increment primary key**\r\n**Case 1:**\r\n&ensp; Input: map or map list without primary key\r\n&ensp; Output: map or map list will be filled with \"@id\"\r\n**Case 2:**\r\n&ensp; Input: map or map list with primary key\r\n&ensp; Output: map or map list will be filled with \"@id\"\r\n\r\nThe following cases are all using **non-auto-increment primary key**\r\n**Case 1:**\r\n&ensp; Input: map or map list without primary key\r\n&ensp; Output: error, the same as before.\r\n**Case 2:**\r\n&ensp; Input: map or map list with primary key\r\n&ensp; Output: the same as before\r\n\r\nLast but not least, it has no impact on non-auto-increment primary keys.\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Your use case

Bug description\r\n\r\nHi, I've tried to update to the v0.23 release and I received the following error: \r\n\r\n```log\r\n{\"level\":\"fatal\",\"error\":\"LastInsertId is not supported by this driver\",\"time\":1708000343,\"message\":\"Migration failed: LastInsertId is not supported by this driver\"}\r\n```\r\n\r\nJust to make sure, I've updated Postgres to the latest 16.x version, but I'm still receiving this error message.\r\n\r\nI'm not certain what `LastInsertId` should do, I'm guessing it should return the latest used sequential number on `INSERT`? Since it doesn't seem supported by Postgres, I would maybe suggest looking into `RETURNING` (see [PostgreSQL - INSERT](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/16/sql-insert.html)) if there is no simpler workaround.\r\n\r\n> The optional `RETURNING` clause causes `INSERT` to compute and return value(s) based on each row actually inserted [...]. This is primarily useful for obtaining values that were supplied by defaults, such as a serial sequence number.\r\n\r\n## Environment\r\n\r\n- Version of headscale used: `headscale/headscale:0.23.0`; Postgres 15.x and 16.x\r\n- [x] Headscale is behind a (reverse) proxy (`envoyproxy/envoy:v1.29.1`)\r\n- [x] Headscale runs in a container\r\n\r\n## To Reproduce\r\n\r\n1. Have an existing (working) installation using PostgreSQL\r\n2. Update the config to accommodate for the breaking changes (`db_*` -> `database.postgres.*`) and set the database to `postgres` again.\r\n3. Update the command in docker from ´headscale serve` to `serve`\r\n4. Deploy the new version\r\n5.
