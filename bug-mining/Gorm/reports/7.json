They mention the `Rows()` function can be used to iterate over table but since this returns `*sql.Row`, I'm not sure how to scan this into the struct for this row. The great thing about gorm is that it handles parsing the sql data into a struct, but this seems to be missing for iteration.\n\nThe example shows this, which really isn't great given how easy all of the other functions are to use.\n\n```\nrows.Scan(&name, &age, &email)\n```\n","closed_by":{"login":"jinzhu","id":6843,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4NDM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6843?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinzhu","html_url":"https://github.com/jinzhu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinzhu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinzhu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinzhu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinzhu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinzhu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinzhu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinzhu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinzhu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinzhu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/go-gorm/gorm/issues/59/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/go-gorm/gorm/issues/59/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
