The problem is the line:\r\n\r\n    assertTrue(message.contains(\"WARNING: A connection to \" + server.url(\"/\") + \" was leaked.\"\r\n        + \" Did you forget to close a response body?\"));\r\n\r\n`WARNING` is for example `WARNUNG` (German for \"WARNING\") on a JVM with a German locale. If you tell me how I should fix it (JUnit `@Rule`, `Locale.setDefault(...)`, just removing \"WARNING\" from the assertion) I'll do it.","closed_by":{"login":"swankjesse","id":133019,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMzAxOQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/133019?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/swankjesse","html_url":"https://github.com/swankjesse","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swankjesse/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swankjesse/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swankjesse/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swankjesse/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swankjesse/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swankjesse/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swankjesse/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swankjesse/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swankjesse/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/square/okhttp/issues/3211/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/square/okhttp/issues/3211/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
