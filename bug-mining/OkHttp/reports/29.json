While I unfortunately don't have a repro, looking at Conscrypt's code, it seems this is a valid possibility, as per the code in [Conscrypt.java line 112](https://github.com/google/conscrypt/blob/85f6ce9f27ae1989657d70b428b6c10c69ce6068/common/src/main/java/org/conscrypt/Conscrypt.java#L112). That having been said, I realize this is an edge case, especially since these devices (Samsung/Motorola) are actually returning `true` for conscrypt being enabled, but `null` for the version.\r\n\r\nWould it be possible to treat a `null` version as a signal for Conscrypt not being supported? Happy to open a PR if this is reasonable.\r\n\r\n```\r\nCaused by java.lang.NullPointerException: Attempt to invoke virtual method 'int org.conscrypt.Conscrypt$Version.major()' on a null object reference\r\n       at okhttp3.internal.platform.ConscryptPlatform$Companion.atLeastVersion(ConscryptPlatform.java:129)\r\n       at okhttp3.internal.platform.ConscryptPlatform.<clinit>(ConscryptPlatform.java:115)\r\n       at okhttp3.internal.platform.android.ConscryptSocketAdapter$Companion$factory$1.matchesSocket(ConscryptSocketAdapter.java:58)\r\n       at okhttp3.internal.platform.android.DeferredSocketAdapter.matchesSocket(DeferredSocketAdapter.java:37)\r\n       at okhttp3.internal.platform.AndroidPlatform.configureTlsExtensions(AndroidPlatform.java:85)\r\n       at okhttp3.internal.connection.RealConnection.connectTls(RealConnection.java:375)\r\n       at okhttp3.internal.connection.RealConnection.establishProtocol(RealConnection.java:337)\r\n       at okhttp3.internal.connection.RealConnection.connect(RealConnection.java:209)\r\n```","closed_by":{"login":"swankjesse","id":133019,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMzAxOQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/133019?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/swankjesse","html_url":"https://github.com/swankjesse","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swankjesse/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swankjesse/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swankjesse/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swankjesse/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swankjesse/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swankjesse/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swankjesse/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swankjesse/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swankjesse/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/square/okhttp/issues/6502/reactions","total_count":3,"+1":3,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/square/okhttp/issues/6502/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed"}
