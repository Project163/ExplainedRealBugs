the problem is that Java and Android programs default to using a single global SSL context, accessible to our HTTP clients as the SSLSocketFactory. When OkHttp enables NPN for its own SPDY-related stuff, it ends up turning on NPN for the singleton shared SSL socket factory. Later when HttpURLConnection attempts to do SSL, it freaks out and crashes because NPN is enabled when it isn't expected to be.\n\nA simple immediate workaround for OkHttp is to configure the client to create its own SSL context rather than using the system default. The code to set that up looks like this:\n\n```\n      OkHttpClient okHttpClient = new OkHttpClient();\n      SSLContext sslContext;\n      try {\n        sslContext = SSLContext.getInstance(\"TLS\");\n        sslContext.init(null, null, null);\n      } catch (GeneralSecurityException e) {\n        throw new AssertionError(); // The system has no TLS. Just give up.\n      }\n      okHttpClient.setSslSocketFactory(sslContext.getSocketFactory());\n```\n\nI'll investigate changing OkHttp to prefer its own SSL context over the system default. The significant drawback of this approach is that apps that customize the global SSL context will lose these customizations. This could break important features like certificate pinning! So I should be extremely careful if I'm changing behavior here.\n","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/square/okhttp/issues/comments/18772733/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"swankjesse","id":133019,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMzAxOQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/133019?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/swankjesse","html_url":"https://github.com/swankjesse","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swankjesse/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swankjesse/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swankjesse/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swankjesse/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swankjesse/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swankjesse/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swankjesse/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swankjesse/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/swankjesse/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/square/okhttp/issues/comments/18784223","html_url":"https://github.com/square/okhttp/issues/184#issuecomment-18784223","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/square/okhttp/issues/184","id":18784223,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDE4Nzg0MjIz","user":{"login":"andy572","id":588851,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU4ODg1MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/588851?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/andy572","html_url":"https://github.com/andy572","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andy572/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andy572/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andy572/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andy572/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andy572/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andy572/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andy572/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andy572/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andy572/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2013-06-01T05:59:28Z","updated_at":"2013-06-01T05:59:28Z","body":"the

In my Application class I overload onCreate:\n\n@Override\npublic void onCreate(){\n    super.onCreate();\n\n```\nURL.setURLStreamHandlerFactory(new OkHttpClient());\nBugSenseHandler.initAndStartSession(this, \"apikey\");\n```\n\n}\n\nSometimes when an unhandled exception is thrown, BugSense will catch it, then try to report it via SSL and fail with the SSL error. It doesn't always happen, which makes it hard to track down. Maybe the original SSL context is released?\n","author_association":"NONE","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/square/okhttp/issues/comments/21449700/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"brycehendrix","id":607867,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYwNzg2Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/607867?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/brycehendrix","html_url":"https://github.com/brycehendrix","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brycehendrix/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brycehendrix/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brycehendrix/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brycehendrix/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brycehendrix/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brycehendrix/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brycehendrix/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brycehendrix/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brycehendrix/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":57761384,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50NTc3NjEzODQ=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/square/okhttp/issues/events/57761384","actor":null,"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2013-07-23T22:05:56Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":57761385,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDU3NzYxMzg1","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/square/okhttp/issues/events/57761385","actor":null,"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2013-07-23T22:05:56Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":58933606,"node_id":"MDE1OlJlZmVyZW5jZWRFdmVudDU4OTMzNjA2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/square/okhttp/issues/events/58933606","actor":{"login":"tmszdmsk","id":398112,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5ODExMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/398112?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmszdmsk","html_url":"https://github.com/tmszdmsk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmszdmsk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmszdmsk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmszdmsk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmszdmsk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmszdmsk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmszdmsk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmszdmsk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmszdmsk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmszdmsk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"referenced","commit_id":"a95dd8c482cc5f7efdb6947b8007914dca181412","commit_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tmszdmsk/arij/commits/a95dd8c482cc5f7efdb6947b8007914dca181412","created_at":"2013-07-31T22:39:21Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/square/okhttp/issues/comments/22234082","html_url":"https://github.com/square/okhttp/issues/184#issuecomment-22234082","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/square/okhttp/issues/184","id":22234082,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDIyMjM0MDgy","user":{"login":"robUx4","id":657717,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1NzcxNw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/657717?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/robUx4","html_url":"https://github.com/robUx4","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robUx4/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robUx4/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robUx4/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robUx4/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robUx4/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robUx4/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robUx4/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robUx4/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robUx4/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2013-08-07T07:25:13Z","updated_at":"2013-08-07T07:26:03Z","body":"I am also having issues with Google Analytics when mixed with okhttp.
