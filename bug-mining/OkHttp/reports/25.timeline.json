Heck, supporting both Android and Java is a headache.\r\n\r\nIf RoboVM users would like to submit small patches or workarounds, I’m receptive.

@guillerodriguez Is it possible to backport the check from #4269 to v4?\r\n\r\n(Sorry, didn't get a notification for this)\r\n\r\nBackporting the check is not straightforward for several reasons:\r\n\r\n 1. OkHttp now [checks the java.vm.name system property](https://github.com/dkimitsa/okhttp/blob/93b5a1af7548b2dd6eb163528a20d5211c9e51c1/okhttp/src/main/kotlin/okhttp3/internal/platform/Platform.kt#L190) to decide if it is running on Android. This returns \"Dalvik\" on Android but \"RoboVM\" in RoboVM. So RoboVM would not be identified as an Android based target. If you want to support RoboVM (as a \"pseudo-Android target\") this check would need to be updated.\r\n 2. OkHttp now requires Android 5 minimum I think. RoboVM is based on an Android4 runtime. Not sure about the real implications of this (would need to check).\r\n 3. The [AndroidPlatform class](https://github.com/dkimitsa/okhttp/blob/93b5a1af7548b2dd6eb163528a20d5211c9e51c1/okhttp/src/main/kotlin/okhttp3/internal/platform/AndroidPlatform.kt) now has `Build.VERSION.SDK_INT` checks all over the place, so this would need to be extracted to a separate helper function to catch the NoClassDefFound exceptions, or perhaps the check could simply be skipped for the RoboVM case.\r\n\r\nSome other approaches that you may want to try:\r\n\r\n * Patch `Platform.kt` so that it also considers RoboVM as an Android platform (java.vm.name == \"RoboVM\"), then add an android.os.Build class to your application (as shown [here](https://github.com/MobiVM/robovm/issues/325#issuecomment-420311698)) with appropriate SDK_INT version.\r\n * Have a look at PR #6133 from dkmitsa (this adds a specific RoboVM platform implementation)\r\n","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/square/okhttp/issues/comments/840500937/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"guillerodriguez","id":2486184,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0ODYxODQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2486184?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/guillerodriguez","html_url":"https://github.com/guillerodriguez","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guillerodriguez/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guillerodriguez/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guillerodriguez/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guillerodriguez/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guillerodriguez/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guillerodriguez/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guillerodriguez/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guillerodriguez/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guillerodriguez/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"id":4741429989,"node_id":"MDE0Ok1lbnRpb25lZEV2ZW50NDc0MTQyOTk4OQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/square/okhttp/issues/events/4741429989","actor":{"login":"guillerodriguez","id":2486184,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0ODYxODQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2486184?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/guillerodriguez","html_url":"https://github.com/guillerodriguez","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guillerodriguez/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guillerodriguez/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guillerodriguez/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guillerodriguez/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guillerodriguez/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guillerodriguez/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guillerodriguez/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guillerodriguez/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guillerodriguez/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"mentioned","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-05-13T11:38:40Z","performed_via_github_app":null},{"id":4741429995,"node_id":"MDE1OlN1YnNjcmliZWRFdmVudDQ3NDE0Mjk5OTU=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/square/okhttp/issues/events/4741429995","actor":{"login":"guillerodriguez","id":2486184,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0ODYxODQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2486184?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/guillerodriguez","html_url":"https://github.com/guillerodriguez","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guillerodriguez/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guillerodriguez/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guillerodriguez/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guillerodriguez/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guillerodriguez/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guillerodriguez/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guillerodriguez/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guillerodriguez/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guillerodriguez/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"event":"subscribed","commit_id":null,"commit_url":null,"created_at":"2021-05-13T11:38:40Z","performed_via_github_app":null}]
