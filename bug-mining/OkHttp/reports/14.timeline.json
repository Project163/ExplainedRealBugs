However, the Javadoc of this exception says it can also be thrown if you attempt to write over a read-only connection. It's weird and doesn't sound like a great fit. Then again, we might not have too much choice.\n\nWhy not SecurityException which is about violating access/security policy? Once argument against that I've heard so far is that it's not a checked type and thus it might crash the process because it's not being caught (usually). However, code that cares about the security implications can catch these exceptions. Also, SecurityException is what happens if you have a Security Manager installed that denies TCP connections to some destination. Thus, if cleartext HTTP is denied, it's somewhat natural that SecurityException is thrown.\n\nWe could also let the user of okhttp customize what exception is thrown. For example, they could provide the class of the exception. This way, they can choose themselves whether they want a SecurityException or some subclass of an IOException.\n","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/square/okhttp/issues/comments/73988025/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"performed_via_github_app":null,"event":"commented","actor":{"login":"klyubin","id":6598762,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1OTg3NjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6598762?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/klyubin","html_url":"https://github.com/klyubin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/klyubin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/klyubin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/klyubin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/klyubin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/klyubin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/klyubin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/klyubin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/klyubin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/klyubin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/square/okhttp/issues/comments/73989292","html_url":"https://github.com/square/okhttp/issues/1392#issuecomment-73989292","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/square/okhttp/issues/1392","id":73989292,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDczOTg5Mjky","user":{"login":"klyubin","id":6598762,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1OTg3NjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6598762?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/klyubin","html_url":"https://github.com/klyubin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/klyubin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/klyubin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/klyubin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/klyubin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/klyubin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/klyubin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/klyubin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/klyubin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/klyubin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-02-11T23:39:44Z","updated_at":"2015-02-11T23:39:44Z","body":"P.S.
