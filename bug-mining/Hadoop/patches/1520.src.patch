 The simulator will exercise the real Yarn `ResourceManager` removing the network factor by simulating `NodeManagers` and `ApplicationMasters` via handling and dispatching `NM`/`AMs` heartbeat events from within the same JVM. To keep tracking of scheduler behavior and performance, a scheduler wrapper will wrap the real scheduler.

 $H3 Hadoop Aggregate Package
 
-Hadoop has a library package called [Aggregate](../api/org/apache/hadoop/mapred/lib/aggregate/package-summary.html). Aggregate provides a special reducer class and a special combiner class, and a list of simple aggregators that perform aggregations such as "sum", "max", "min" and so on over a sequence of values. Aggregate allows you to define a mapper plugin class that is expected to generate "aggregatable items" for each input key/value pair of the mappers. The combiner/reducer will aggregate those aggregatable items by invoking the appropriate aggregators.

 $H3 Hadoop Field Selection Class
 
-Hadoop has a library class, [FieldSelectionMapReduce](../api/org/apache/hadoop/mapred/lib/FieldSelectionMapReduce.html), that effectively allows you to process text data like the unix "cut" utility. The map function defined in the class treats each input key/value pair as a list of fields. You can specify the field separator (the default is the tab character). You can select an arbitrary list of fields as the map output key, and an arbitrary list of fields as the map output value. Similarly, the reduce function defined in the class treats each input key/value pair as a list of fields. You can select an arbitrary list of fields as the reduce output key, and an arbitrary list of fields as the reduce output value. For example:

-See [Configured Parameters](../hadoop-mapreduce-client/hadoop-mapreduce-client-core/MapReduceTutorial.html#Configured_Parameters). During the execution of a streaming job, the names of the "mapred" parameters are transformed. The dots ( . ) become underscores ( \_ ).
