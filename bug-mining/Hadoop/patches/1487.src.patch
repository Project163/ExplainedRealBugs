 ### HTrace
 
-[HDFS-5274](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HDFS-5274) added support for tracing requests through HDFS, using the open source tracing library, [Apache HTrace](https://git-wip-us.apache.org/repos/asf/incubator-htrace.git). Setting up tracing is quite simple, however it requires some very minor changes to your client code.
