+     <blockquote>The error is shown below in the comments.

+MAPREDUCE-2374 fixed this by removing "-c" when running the container launch script.  It looks like the "-c" got brought back during the windows branch merge, so we should remove it again.</blockquote></li>

+     <b>TestApplicationCleanup relies on all containers assigned in a single heartbeat</b><br>
+     <blockquote>TestApplicationCleanup submits container requests and waits for allocations to come in.  It only sends a single node heartbeat to the node, expecting multiple containers to be assigned on this heartbeat, which not all schedulers do by default.
+
+This is causing the test to fail when run with the Fair Scheduler.</blockquote></li>

+     <b>RM_HOME link breaks when webapp.https.address related properties are not specified</b><br>
+     <blockquote>This issue happens in multiple node cluster where resource manager and node manager are running on different machines.
+
+Steps to reproduce:
+1) set yarn.resourcemanager.hostname = &lt;resourcemanager host&gt; in yarn-site.xml
+2) set hadoop.ssl.enabled = true in core-site.xml
+3) Do not specify below property in yarn-site.xml
+yarn.nodemanager.webapp.https.address and yarn.resourcemanager.webapp.https.address
+Here, the default value of above two property will be considered.
+4) Go to nodemanager web UI "https://&lt;nodemanager host&gt;:8044/node"
+5) Click on RM_HOME link 
+This link redirects to "https://&lt;nodemanager host&gt;:8090/cluster" instead "https://&lt;resourcemanager host&gt;:8090/cluster"

+     <b>NM silently ignores non-existent service in StartContainerRequest</b><br>
+     <blockquote>A container can set token service metadata for a service, say shuffle_service. If that service does not exist then the errors is silently ignored. Later, when the next container wants to access data written to shuffle_service by the first task, then it fails because the service does not have the token that was supposed to be set by the first task.</blockquote></li>

+     <b>Log application status in the rm log when app is done running</b><br>
+     <blockquote>Since there is no yarn history server it becomes difficult to determine what the status of an old application is. One has to be familiar with the state transition in yarn to know what means a success.
+
+We should add a log at info level that captures what the finalStatus of an app is. This would be helpful while debugging applications if the RM has restarted and we no longer can use the UI.</blockquote></li>

+     <b>FairScheduler setting queue name in RMApp is not working </b><br>
+     <blockquote>The fair scheduler sometimes picks a different queue than the one an application was submitted to, such as when user-as-default-queue is turned on.  It needs to update the queue name in the RMApp so that this choice will be reflected in the UI.
+
+This isn't working because the scheduler is looking up the RMApp by application attempt id instead of app id and failing to find it.</blockquote></li>

+     Major improvement reported by Sandy Ryza and fixed by Sandy Ryza (scheduler)<br>
+     <b>Clean up Fair Scheduler configuration loading</b><br>
+     <blockquote>Currently the Fair Scheduler is configured in two ways
+* An allocations file that has a different format than the standard Hadoop configuration file, which makes it easier to specify hierarchical objects like queues and their properties. 
+* With properties like yarn.scheduler.fair.max.assign that are specified in the standard Hadoop configuration format.
+
+The standard and default way of configuring it is to use fair-scheduler.xml as the allocations file and to put the yarn.scheduler properties in yarn-site.xml.
+
+It is also possible to specify a different file as the allocations file, and to place the yarn.scheduler properties in fair-scheduler.xml, which will be interpreted as in the standard Hadoop configuration format.  This flexibility is both confusing and unnecessary.
+
+Additionally, the allocation file is loaded as fair-scheduler.xml from the classpath if it is not specified, but is loaded as a File if it is.  This causes two problems
+1. We see different behavior when not setting the yarn.scheduler.fair.allocation.file, and setting it to fair-scheduler.xml, which is its default.
+2. Classloaders may choose to cache resources, which can break the reload logic when yarn.scheduler.fair.allocation.file is not specified.
+
+We should never allow the yarn.scheduler properties to go into fair-scheduler.xml.  And we should always load the allocations file as a file, not as a resource on the classpath.  To preserve existing behavior and allow loading files from the classpath, we can look for files on the classpath, but strip of their scheme and interpret them as Files.

+     <b>FSDownload changes file suffix making FileUtil.unTar() throw exception</b><br>
+     <blockquote>While running a Hive join operation on Yarn, I saw exception as described below. This is caused by FSDownload copy the files into a temp file and change the suffix into ".tmp" before unpacking it. In unpack(), it uses FileUtil.unTar() which will determine if the file is "gzipped" by looking at the file suffix:
+{code}
+boolean gzipped = inFile.toString().endsWith("gz");
+{code}
+
+To fix this problem, we can remove the ".tmp" in the temp file name.

+     <b>Yarn URL should include userinfo</b><br>
+     <blockquote>In the {{org.apache.hadoop.yarn.api.records.URL}} class, we don't have an userinfo as part of the URL. When converting a {{java.net.URI}} object into the YARN URL object in {{ConverterUtils.getYarnUrlFromURI()}} method, we will set uri host as the url host. If the uri has a userinfo part, the userinfo is discarded. This will lead to information loss if the original uri has the userinfo, e.g. foo://username:password@example.com will be converted to foo://example.com and username/password information is lost during the conversion.
