 This command takes a previously generated encrypted key, and re-encrypts it using the latest KeyVersion encryption key in the KeyProvider. If the latest KeyVersion is the same as the one used to generate the encrypted key, the same encrypted key is returned.
 
-This is usually useful after a [Rollover](Rollover_Key) of an encryption key. Re-encrypting the encrypted key will allow it to be encrypted using the latest version of the encryption key, but still with the same key material and initialization vector.
