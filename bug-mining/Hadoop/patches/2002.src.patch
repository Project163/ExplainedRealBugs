 The benchmark measures the number of operations performed by the name-node per second. Specifically, for each operation tested, it reports the total running time in seconds (_Elapsed Time_), operation throughput (_Ops per sec_), and average time for the operations (_Average Time_). The higher, the better.
 
 Following is a sample reports by running following commands that opens 100K files with 1K threads against a remote name-node. See [HDFS scalability: the limits to growth](https://www.usenix.org/legacy/publications/login/2010-04/openpdfs/shvachko.pdf) for real-world benchmark stats.
