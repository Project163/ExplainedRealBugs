-| `yarn.resourcemanager.zk-num-retries` | Number of times RM tries to connect to ZooKeeper server if the connection is lost. Default value is 500. |

-| `yarn.resourcemanager.zk-timeout-ms` | ZooKeeper session timeout in milliseconds. This configuration is used by the ZooKeeper server to determine when the session expires. Session expiration happens when the server does not hear from the client (i.e. no heartbeat) within the session timeout period specified by this configuration. Default value is 10 seconds |
