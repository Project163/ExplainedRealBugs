 --------------------
 
-Flag              | Description                          | Notes
------------------ | ------------------------------------ | --------
-`-p[rbugpcaxt]` | Preserve r: replication number b: block size u: user g: group p: permission c: checksum-type a: ACL x: XAttr t: timestamp | When `-update` is specified, status updates will **not** be synchronized unless the file sizes also differ (i.e. unless the file is re-created). If -pa is specified, DistCp preserves the permissions also because ACLs are a super-set of permissions. The option -pr is only valid if both source and target directory are not erasure coded. **Note:** If -p option's are not specified, then by default block size is preserved.
-`-i` | Ignore failures | As explained in the Appendix, this option will keep more accurate statistics about the copy than the default case. It also preserves logs from failed copies, which can be valuable for debugging. Finally, a failing map will not cause the job to fail before all splits are attempted.
-`-log <logdir>` | Write logs to \<logdir\> | DistCp keeps logs of each file it attempts to copy as map output. If a map fails, the log output will not be retained if it is re-executed.
-`-v` | Log additional info (path, size) in the SKIP/COPY log | This option can only be used with -log option.
-`-m <num_maps>` | Maximum number of simultaneous copies | Specify the number of maps to copy data. Note that more maps may not necessarily improve throughput.
-`-overwrite` | Overwrite destination | If a map fails and `-i` is not specified, all the files in the split, not only those that failed, will be recopied. As discussed in the Usage documentation, it also changes the semantics for generating destination paths, so users should use this carefully.
-`-update` | Overwrite if source and destination differ in size, blocksize, or checksum | As noted in the preceding, this is not a "sync" operation. The criteria examined are the source and destination file sizes, blocksizes, and checksums; if they differ, the source file replaces the destination file. As discussed in the Usage documentation, it also changes the semantics for generating destination paths, so users should use this carefully.
-`-append` | Incremental copy of file with same name but different length | If the source file is greater in length than the destination file, the checksum of the common length part is compared. If the checksum matches, only the difference is copied using read and append functionalities. The -append option only works with `-update` without `-skipcrccheck`
-`-f <urilist_uri>` | Use list at \<urilist_uri\> as src list | This is equivalent to listing each source on the command line. The `urilist_uri` list should be a fully qualified URI.
-`-filters` | The path to a file containing a list of pattern strings, one string per line, such that paths matching the pattern will be excluded from the copy. | Support regular expressions specified by java.util.regex.Pattern.
-`-filelimit <n>` | Limit the total number of files to be <= n | **Deprecated!** Ignored in the new DistCp.
-`-sizelimit <n>` | Limit the total size to be <= n bytes | **Deprecated!** Ignored in the new DistCp.
-`-delete` | Delete the files existing in the dst but not in src | The deletion is done by FS Shell. So the trash will be used, if it is enable. Delete is applicable only with update or overwrite options.
-`-strategy {dynamic|uniformsize}` | Choose the copy-strategy to be used in DistCp. | By default, uniformsize is used. (i.e. Maps are balanced on the total size of files copied by each map. Similar to legacy.) If "dynamic" is specified, `DynamicInputFormat` is used instead. (This is described in the Architecture section, under InputFormats.)
-`-bandwidth` | Specify bandwidth per map, in MB/second. | Each map will be restricted to consume only the specified bandwidth. This is not always exact. The map throttles back its bandwidth consumption during a copy, such that the **net** bandwidth used tends towards the specified value.
-`-atomic {-tmp <tmp_dir>}` | Specify atomic commit, with optional tmp directory. | `-atomic` instructs DistCp to copy the source data to a temporary target location, and then move the temporary target to the final-location atomically. Data will either be available at final target in a complete and consistent form, or not at all. Optionally, `-tmp` may be used to specify the location of the tmp-target. If not specified, a default is chosen. **Note:** tmp_dir must be on the final target cluster.
-`-async` | Run DistCp asynchronously. Quits as soon as the Hadoop Job is launched. | The Hadoop Job-id is logged, for tracking.
-`-diff <oldSnapshot> <newSnapshot>` | Use snapshot diff report between given two snapshots to identify the difference between source and target, and apply the diff to the target to make it in sync with source. | This option is valid only with `-update` option and the following conditions should be satisfied. <ol><li> Both the source and the target FileSystem must be DistributedFileSystem.</li> <li> Two snapshots `<oldSnapshot>` and `<newSnapshot>` have been created on the source FS, and `<oldSnapshot>` is older than `<newSnapshot>`. </li> <li> The target has the same snapshot `<oldSnapshot>`. No changes have been made on the target since `<oldSnapshot>` was created, thus `<oldSnapshot>` has the same content as the current state of the target. All the files/directories in the target are the same with source's `<oldSnapshot>`.</li></ol> |
-`-rdiff <newSnapshot> <oldSnapshot>` | Use snapshot diff report between given two snapshots to identify what has been changed on the target since the snapshot `<oldSnapshot>` was created on the target, and apply the diff reversely to the target, and copy modified files from the source's `<oldSnapshot>`, to make the target the same as `<oldSnapshot>`. | This option is valid only with `-update` option and the following conditions should be satisfied. <ol><li>Both the source and the target FileSystem must be DistributedFileSystem. The source and the target can be two different clusters/paths, or they can be exactly the same cluster/path. In the latter case, modified files are copied from target's `<oldSnapshot>` to target's current state).</li>  <li> Two snapshots `<newSnapshot>` and `<oldSnapshot>` have been created on the target FS, and `<oldSnapshot>` is older than `<newSnapshot>`. No change has been made on target since `<newSnapshot>` was created on the target. </li> <li> The source has the same snapshot `<oldSnapshot>`, which has the same content as the `<oldSnapshot>` on the target. All the files/directories in the target's `<oldSnapshot>` are the same with source's `<oldSnapshot>`.</li> </ol> |
-`-numListstatusThreads` | Number of threads to use for building file listing | At most 40 threads.
-`-skipcrccheck` | Whether to skip CRC checks between source and target paths. |
-`-blocksperchunk <blocksperchunk>` | Number of blocks per chunk. When specified, split files into chunks to copy in parallel | If set to a positive value, files with more blocks than this value will be split into chunks of `<blocksperchunk>` blocks to be transferred in parallel, and reassembled on the destination. By default, `<blocksperchunk>` is 0 and the files will be transmitted in their entirety without splitting. This switch is only applicable when the source file system implements getBlockLocations method and the target file system implements concat method. |
-`-copybuffersize <copybuffersize>` | Size of the copy buffer to use. By default, `<copybuffersize>` is set to 8192B |
-`-xtrack <path>` | Save information about missing source files to the specified path. | This option is only valid with `-update` option. This is an experimental property and it cannot be used with `-atomic` option.
-`-direct` | Write directly to destination paths | Useful for avoiding potentially very expensive temporary file rename operations when the destination is an object store
