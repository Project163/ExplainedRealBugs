-     3.1. Application of License.
-     The Modifications which You create or to which You contribute are
-     governed by the terms of this License, including without limitation
-     Section 2.2. The Source Code version of Covered Code may be
-     distributed only under the terms of this License or a future version
-     of this License released under Section 6.1, and You must include a
-     copy of this License with every copy of the Source Code You
-     distribute. You may not offer or impose any terms on any Source Code
-     version that alters or restricts the applicable version of this
-     License or the recipients' rights hereunder. However, You may include
-     an additional document offering the additional rights described in
-     Section 3.5.
-
-     3.2. Availability of Source Code.
-     Any Modification which You create or to which You contribute must be
-     made available in Source Code form under the terms of this License
-     either on the same media as an Executable version or via an accepted
-     Electronic Distribution Mechanism to anyone to whom you made an
-     Executable version available; and if made available via Electronic
-     Distribution Mechanism, must remain available for at least twelve (12)
-     months after the date it initially became available, or at least six
-     (6) months after a subsequent version of that particular Modification
-     has been made available to such recipients. You are responsible for
-     ensuring that the Source Code version remains available even if the
-     Electronic Distribution Mechanism is maintained by a third party.
-
-     3.3. Description of Modifications.
-     You must cause all Covered Code to which You contribute to contain a
-     file documenting the changes You made to create that Covered Code and
-     the date of any change. You must include a prominent statement that
-     the Modification is derived, directly or indirectly, from Original
-     Code provided by the Initial Developer and including the name of the
-     Initial Developer in (a) the Source Code, and (b) in any notice in an
-     Executable version or related documentation in which You describe the
-     origin or ownership of the Covered Code.
-
-     3.4. Intellectual Property Matters
-          (a) Third Party Claims.
-          If Contributor has knowledge that a license under a third party's
-          intellectual property rights is required to exercise the rights
-          granted by such Contributor under Sections 2.1 or 2.2,
-          Contributor must include a text file with the Source Code
-          distribution titled "LEGAL" which describes the claim and the
-          party making the claim in sufficient detail that a recipient will
-          know whom to contact. If Contributor obtains such knowledge after
-          the Modification is made available as described in Section 3.2,
-          Contributor shall promptly modify the LEGAL file in all copies
-          Contributor makes available thereafter and shall take other steps
-          (such as notifying appropriate mailing lists or newsgroups)
-          reasonably calculated to inform those who received the Covered
-          Code that new knowledge has been obtained.
-
-          (b) Contributor APIs.
-          If Contributor's Modifications include an application programming
-          interface and Contributor has knowledge of patent licenses which
-          are reasonably necessary to implement that API, Contributor must
-          also include this information in the LEGAL file.
-
-               (c)    Representations.
-          Contributor represents that, except as disclosed pursuant to
-          Section 3.4(a) above, Contributor believes that Contributor's
-          Modifications are Contributor's original creation(s) and/or
-          Contributor has sufficient rights to grant the rights conveyed by
-          this License.
-
-     3.5. Required Notices.
-     You must duplicate the notice in Exhibit A in each file of the Source
-     Code.  If it is not possible to put such notice in a particular Source
-     Code file due to its structure, then You must include such notice in a
-     location (such as a relevant directory) where a user would be likely
-     to look for such a notice.  If You created one or more Modification(s)
-     You may add your name as a Contributor to the notice described in
-     Exhibit A.  You must also duplicate this License in any documentation
-     for the Source Code where You describe recipients' rights or ownership
-     rights relating to Covered Code.  You may choose to offer, and to
-     charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability
-     obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Code. However, You
-     may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial
-     Developer or any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear than
-     any such warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligation is
-     offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial
-     Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the
-     Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of warranty,
-     support, indemnity or liability terms You offer.
-
-     3.6. Distribution of Executable Versions.
-     You may distribute Covered Code in Executable form only if the
-     requirements of Section 3.1-3.5 have been met for that Covered Code,
-     and if You include a notice stating that the Source Code version of
-     the Covered Code is available under the terms of this License,
-     including a description of how and where You have fulfilled the
-     obligations of Section 3.2. The notice must be conspicuously included
-     in any notice in an Executable version, related documentation or
-     collateral in which You describe recipients' rights relating to the
-     Covered Code. You may distribute the Executable version of Covered
-     Code or ownership rights under a license of Your choice, which may
-     contain terms different from this License, provided that You are in
-     compliance with the terms of this License and that the license for the
-     Executable version does not attempt to limit or alter the recipient's
-     rights in the Source Code version from the rights set forth in this
-     License. If You distribute the Executable version under a different
-     license You must make it absolutely clear that any terms which differ
-     from this License are offered by You alone, not by the Initial
-     Developer or any Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify the
-     Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by
-     the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of any such
-     terms You offer.
-
-     3.7. Larger Works.
-     You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Code with other code
-     not governed by the terms of this License and distribute the Larger
-     Work as a single product. In such a case, You must make sure the
-     requirements of this License are fulfilled for the Covered Code.
-
-4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation.
-
-     If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this
-     License with respect to some or all of the Covered Code due to
-     statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with
-     the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b)
-     describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description
-     must be included in the LEGAL file described in Section 3.4 and must
-     be included with all distributions of the Source Code. Except to the
-     extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be
-     sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to
-     understand it.
-
-5. Application of this License.
-
-     This License applies to code to which the Initial Developer has
-     attached the notice in Exhibit A and to related Covered Code.
-
-6. Versions of the License.
-
-     6.1. New Versions.
-     Netscape Communications Corporation ("Netscape") may publish revised
-     and/or new versions of the License from time to time. Each version
-     will be given a distinguishing version number.
-
-     6.2. Effect of New Versions.
-     Once Covered Code has been published under a particular version of the
-     License, You may always continue to use it under the terms of that
-     version. You may also choose to use such Covered Code under the terms
-     of any subsequent version of the License published by Netscape. No one
-     other than Netscape has the right to modify the terms applicable to
-     Covered Code created under this License.
-
-     6.3. Derivative Works.
-     If You create or use a modified version of this License (which you may
-     only do in order to apply it to code which is not already Covered Code
-     governed by this License), You must (a) rename Your license so that
-     the phrases "Mozilla", "MOZILLAPL", "MOZPL", "Netscape",
-     "MPL", "NPL" or any confusingly similar phrase do not appear in your
-     license (except to note that your license differs from this License)
-     and (b) otherwise make it clear that Your version of the license
-     contains terms which differ from the Mozilla Public License and
-     Netscape Public License. (Filling in the name of the Initial

-
-7. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.
-
-     COVERED CODE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN "AS IS" BASIS,
-     WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING,
-     WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED CODE IS FREE OF
-     DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING.
-     THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED CODE
-     IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY COVERED CODE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT,
-     YOU (NOT THE INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE
-     COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER
-     OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF
-     ANY COVERED CODE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.
-
-8. TERMINATION.
-
-     8.1.  This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate
-     automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to cure
-     such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach. All
-     sublicenses to the Covered Code which are properly granted shall
-     survive any termination of this License. Provisions which, by their
-     nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of this License
-     shall survive.
-
-     8.2.  If You initiate litigation by asserting a patent infringement
-     claim (excluding declatory judgment actions) against Initial Developer
-     or a Contributor (the Initial Developer or Contributor against whom
-     You file such action is referred to as "Participant")  alleging that:
-
-     (a)  such Participant's Contributor Version directly or indirectly
-     infringes any patent, then any and all rights granted by such
-     Participant to You under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License
-     shall, upon 60 days notice from Participant terminate prospectively,
-     unless if within 60 days after receipt of notice You either: (i)
-     agree in writing to pay Participant a mutually agreeable reasonable
-     royalty for Your past and future use of Modifications made by such
-     Participant, or (ii) withdraw Your litigation claim with respect to
-     the Contributor Version against such Participant.  If within 60 days
-     of notice, a reasonable royalty and payment arrangement are not
-     mutually agreed upon in writing by the parties or the litigation claim
-     is not withdrawn, the rights granted by Participant to You under
-     Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 automatically terminate at the expiration of
-     the 60 day notice period specified above.
-
-     (b)  any software, hardware, or device, other than such Participant's
-     Contributor Version, directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then
-     any rights granted to You by such Participant under Sections 2.1(b)
-     and 2.2(b) are revoked effective as of the date You first made, used,
-     sold, distributed, or had made, Modifications made by that
-     Participant.
-
-     8.3.  If You assert a patent infringement claim against Participant
-     alleging that such Participant's Contributor Version directly or
-     indirectly infringes any patent where such claim is resolved (such as
-     by license or settlement) prior to the initiation of patent
-     infringement litigation, then the reasonable value of the licenses
-     granted by such Participant under Sections 2.1 or 2.2 shall be taken
-     into account in determining the amount or value of any payment or
-     license.
-
-     8.4.  In the event of termination under Sections 8.1 or 8.2 above,
-     all end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers)
-     which have been validly granted by You or any distributor hereunder
-     prior to termination shall survive termination.
-
-9. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.
-
-     UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT
-     (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE INITIAL
-     DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED CODE,
-     OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR
-     ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY
-     CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL,
-     WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER
-     COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN
-     INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF
-     LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY
-     RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW
-     PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE
-     EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO
-     THIS EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
-
-10. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.
-
-     The Covered Code is a "commercial item," as that term is defined in
-     48 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of "commercial computer
-     software" and "commercial computer software documentation," as such
-     terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995). Consistent with 48
-     C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (June 1995),
-     all U.S. Government End Users acquire Covered Code with only those
-     rights set forth herein.
-
-11. MISCELLANEOUS.
-
-     This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject
-     matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be
-     unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent
-     necessary to make it enforceable. This License shall be governed by
-     California law provisions (except to the extent applicable law, if
-     any, provides otherwise), excluding its conflict-of-law provisions.
-     With respect to disputes in which at least one party is a citizen of,
-     or an entity chartered or registered to do business in the United
-     States of America, any litigation relating to this License shall be
-     subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal Courts of the Northern
-     District of California, with venue lying in Santa Clara County,
-     California, with the losing party responsible for costs, including
-     without limitation, court costs and reasonable attorneys' fees and
-     expenses. The application of the United Nations Convention on
-     Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded.
-     Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a contract
-     shall be construed against the drafter shall not apply to this
-     License.
-
-12. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS.
-
-     As between Initial Developer and the Contributors, each party is
-     responsible for claims and damages arising, directly or indirectly,
-     out of its utilization of rights under this License and You agree to
-     work with Initial Developer and Contributors to distribute such
-     responsibility on an equitable basis. Nothing herein is intended or
-     shall be deemed to constitute any admission of liability.
-
-13. MULTIPLE-LICENSED CODE.
-
-     Initial Developer may designate portions of the Covered Code as
-     "Multiple-Licensed".  "Multiple-Licensed" means that the Initial
-     Developer permits you to utilize portions of the Covered Code under
-     Your choice of the MPL or the alternative licenses, if any, specified
-     by the Initial Developer in the file described in Exhibit A.
+1.4. “Covered Software”
+means Source Code Form to which the initial Contributor has attached the notice
+in Exhibit A, the Executable Form of such Source Code Form, and Modifications of
+such Source Code Form, in each case including portions thereof.

+license:
+
+under intellectual property rights (other than patent or trademark) Licensable
+by such Contributor to use, reproduce, make available, modify, display, perform,
+distribute, and otherwise exploit its Contributions, either on an unmodified
+basis, with Modifications, or as part of a Larger Work; and
+
+under Patent Claims of such Contributor to make, use, sell, offer for sale, have
+made, import, and otherwise transfer either its Contributions or its Contributor
+Version.
+
+2.2. Effective Date
+
+The licenses granted in Section 2.1 with respect to any Contribution become
+effective for each Contribution on the date the Contributor first distributes
+such Contribution.
+
+2.3. Limitations on Grant Scope
+
+The licenses granted in this Section 2 are the only rights granted under this
+License. No additional rights or licenses will be implied from the distribution
+or licensing of Covered Software under this License. Notwithstanding Section
+2.1(b) above, no patent license is granted by a Contributor:
+
+for any code that a Contributor has removed from Covered Software; or
+
+for infringements caused by: (i) Your and any other third party’s
+modifications of Covered Software, or (ii) the combination of its Contributions
+with other software (except as part of its Contributor Version); or
+
+under Patent Claims infringed by Covered Software in the absence of its
+Contributions.
+
+This License does not grant any rights in the trademarks, service marks, or
+logos of any Contributor (except as may be necessary to comply with the notice
+requirements in Section 3.4).
+
+2.4. Subsequent Licenses
+
+No Contributor makes additional grants as a result of Your choice to distribute
+the Covered Software under a subsequent version of this License (see Section
+10.2) or under the terms of a Secondary License (if permitted under the terms of
+Section 3.3).
+
+2.5. Representation
+
+Each Contributor represents that the Contributor believes its Contributions are
+its original creation(s) or it has sufficient rights to grant the rights to its
+Contributions conveyed by this License.
+
+2.6. Fair Use
+
+This License is not intended to limit any rights You have under applicable
+copyright doctrines of fair use, fair dealing, or other equivalents.
+
+2.7. Conditions
+
+Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, and 3.4 are conditions of the licenses granted in
+Section 2.1.
+
+3. Responsibilities
+
+3.1. Distribution of Source Form
+
+All distribution of Covered Software in Source Code Form, including any
+Modifications that You create or to which You contribute, must be under the
+terms of this License. You must inform recipients that the Source Code Form of
+the Covered Software is governed by the terms of this License, and how they can
+obtain a copy of this License. You may not attempt to alter or restrict the
+recipients’ rights in the Source Code Form.
+
+3.2. Distribution of Executable Form
+
+If You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then:
+
+such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code Form, as
+described in Section 3.1, and You must inform recipients of the Executable Form
+how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code Form by reasonable means in a
+timely manner, at a charge no more than the cost of distribution to the
+recipient; and
+
+You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this License, or
+sublicense it under different terms, provided that the license for the
+Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter the recipients’ rights in
+the Source Code Form under this License.
+
+3.3. Distribution of a Larger Work
+
+You may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice, provided
+that You also comply with the requirements of this License for the Covered
+Software. If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered Software with a work
+governed by one or more Secondary Licenses, and the Covered Software is not
+Incompatible With Secondary Licenses, this License permits You to additionally
+distribute such Covered Software under the terms of such Secondary License(s),
+so that the recipient of the Larger Work may, at their option, further
+distribute the Covered Software under the terms of either this License or such
+Secondary License(s).
+
+3.4. Notices
+
+You may not remove or alter the substance of any license notices (including
+copyright notices, patent notices, disclaimers of warranty, or limitations of
+liability) contained within the Source Code Form of the Covered Software, except
+that You may alter any license notices to the extent required to remedy known
+factual inaccuracies.
+
+3.5. Application of Additional Terms
+
+You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity
+or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Software. However,
+You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of any Contributor. You
+must make it absolutely clear that any such warranty, support, indemnity, or
+liability obligation is offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify
+every Contributor for any liability incurred by such Contributor as a result of
+warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You offer. You may include
+additional disclaimers of warranty and limitations of liability specific to any
+jurisdiction.
+
+4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation
+
+If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License with
+respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to statute, judicial order,
+or regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms of this License to the
+maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the limitations and the code they
+affect. Such description must be placed in a text file included with all
+distributions of the Covered Software under this License. Except to the extent
+prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be sufficiently
+detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.
+
+5. Termination
+
+5.1. The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically if You
+fail to comply with any of its terms. However, if You become compliant, then the
+rights granted under this License from a particular Contributor are reinstated
+(a) provisionally, unless and until such Contributor explicitly and finally
+terminates Your grants, and (b) on an ongoing basis, if such Contributor fails
+to notify You of the non-compliance by some reasonable means prior to 60 days
+after You have come back into compliance. Moreover, Your grants from a
+particular Contributor are reinstated on an ongoing basis if such Contributor
+notifies You of the non-compliance by some reasonable means, this is the first
+time You have received notice of non-compliance with this License from such
+Contributor, and You become compliant prior to 30 days after Your receipt of the
+notice.
+
+5.2. If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent
+infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions, counter-claims, and
+cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version directly or indirectly
+infringes any patent, then the rights granted to You by any and all Contributors
+for the Covered Software under Section 2.1 of this License shall terminate.
+
+5.3. In the event of termination under Sections 5.1 or 5.2 above, all end user
+license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which have been
+validly granted by You or Your distributors under this License prior to
+termination shall survive termination.
+
+6. Disclaimer of Warranty
+
+Covered Software is provided under this License on an “as is” basis, without
+warranty of any kind, either expressed, implied, or statutory, including,
+without limitation, warranties that the Covered Software is free of defects,
+merchantable, fit for a particular purpose or non-infringing. The entire risk as
+to the quality and performance of the Covered Software is with You. Should any
+Covered Software prove defective in any respect, You (not any Contributor)
+assume the cost of any necessary servicing, repair, or correction. This
+disclaimer of warranty constitutes an essential part of this License. No use of
+any Covered Software is authorized under this License except under this
+disclaimer.
+
+7. Limitation of Liability
+
+Under no circumstances and under no legal theory, whether tort (including
+negligence), contract, or otherwise, shall any Contributor, or anyone who
+distributes Covered Software as permitted above, be liable to You for any
+direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character
+including, without limitation, damages for lost profits, loss of goodwill, work
+stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial
+damages or losses, even if such party shall have been informed of the
+possibility of such damages. This limitation of liability shall not apply to
+liability for death or personal injury resulting from such party’s negligence
+to the extent applicable law prohibits such limitation. Some jurisdictions do
+not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential damages, so
+this exclusion and limitation may not apply to You.
+
+8. Litigation
+
+Any litigation relating to this License may be brought only in the courts of a
+jurisdiction where the defendant maintains its principal place of business and
+such litigation shall be governed by laws of that jurisdiction, without
+reference to its conflict-of-law provisions. Nothing in this Section shall
+prevent a party’s ability to bring cross-claims or counter-claims.
+
+9. Miscellaneous
+
+This License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject matter
+hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such
+provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it enforceable.
+Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a contract shall be
+construed against the drafter shall not be used to construe this License against
+a Contributor.
+
+10. Versions of the License
+
+10.1. New Versions
+
+Mozilla Foundation is the license steward. Except as provided in Section 10.3,
+no one other than the license steward has the right to modify or publish new
+versions of this License. Each version will be given a distinguishing version
+number.
+
+10.2. Effect of New Versions
+
+You may distribute the Covered Software under the terms of the version of the
+License under which You originally received the Covered Software, or under the
+terms of any subsequent version published by the license steward.
+
+10.3. Modified Versions
+
+If you create software not governed by this License, and you want to create a
+new license for such software, you may create and use a modified version of this
+License if you rename the license and remove any references to the name of the
+license steward (except to note that such modified license differs from this
+License).
+
+10.4. Distributing Source Code Form that is Incompatible With Secondary Licenses

+Licenses under the terms of this version of the License, the notice described in

+    THE WORK (AS DEFINED BELOW) IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS CREATIVE
+    COMMONS PUBLIC LICENSE ("CCPL" OR "LICENSE"). THE WORK IS PROTECTED BY
+    COPYRIGHT AND/OR OTHER APPLICABLE LAW. ANY USE OF THE WORK OTHER THAN AS
+    AUTHORIZED UNDER THIS LICENSE OR COPYRIGHT LAW IS PROHIBITED.
+
+    BY EXERCISING ANY RIGHTS TO THE WORK PROVIDED HERE, YOU ACCEPT AND AGREE
+    TO BE BOUND BY THE TERMS OF THIS LICENSE. TO THE EXTENT THIS LICENSE MAY
+    BE CONSIDERED TO BE A CONTRACT, THE LICENSOR GRANTS YOU THE RIGHTS
+    CONTAINED HERE IN CONSIDERATION OF YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF SUCH TERMS AND
+    CONDITIONS.
+
+    1. Definitions
+
+     a. "Adaptation" means a work based upon the Work, or upon the Work and
+        other pre-existing works, such as a translation, adaptation,
+        derivative work, arrangement of music or other alterations of a
+        literary or artistic work, or phonogram or performance and includes
+        cinematographic adaptations or any other form in which the Work may be
+        recast, transformed, or adapted including in any form recognizably
+        derived from the original, except that a work that constitutes a
+        Collection will not be considered an Adaptation for the purpose of
+        this License. For the avoidance of doubt, where the Work is a musical
+        work, performance or phonogram, the synchronization of the Work in
+        timed-relation with a moving image ("synching") will be considered an
+        Adaptation for the purpose of this License.
+     b. "Collection" means a collection of literary or artistic works, such as
+        encyclopedias and anthologies, or performances, phonograms or
+        broadcasts, or other works or subject matter other than works listed
+        in Section 1(f) below, which, by reason of the selection and
+        arrangement of their contents, constitute intellectual creations, in
+        which the Work is included in its entirety in unmodified form along
+        with one or more other contributions, each constituting separate and
+        independent works in themselves, which together are assembled into a
+        collective whole. A work that constitutes a Collection will not be
+        considered an Adaptation (as defined above) for the purposes of this
+        License.
+     c. "Distribute" means to make available to the public the original and
+        copies of the Work or Adaptation, as appropriate, through sale or
+        other transfer of ownership.
+     d. "Licensor" means the individual, individuals, entity or entities that
+        offer(s) the Work under the terms of this License.
+     e. "Original Author" means, in the case of a literary or artistic work,
+        the individual, individuals, entity or entities who created the Work
+        or if no individual or entity can be identified, the publisher; and in
+        addition (i) in the case of a performance the actors, singers,
+        musicians, dancers, and other persons who act, sing, deliver, declaim,
+        play in, interpret or otherwise perform literary or artistic works or
+        expressions of folklore; (ii) in the case of a phonogram the producer
+        being the person or legal entity who first fixes the sounds of a
+        performance or other sounds; and, (iii) in the case of broadcasts, the
+        organization that transmits the broadcast.
+     f. "Work" means the literary and/or artistic work offered under the terms
+        of this License including without limitation any production in the
+        literary, scientific and artistic domain, whatever may be the mode or
+        form of its expression including digital form, such as a book,
+        pamphlet and other writing; a lecture, address, sermon or other work
+        of the same nature; a dramatic or dramatico-musical work; a
+        choreographic work or entertainment in dumb show; a musical
+        composition with or without words; a cinematographic work to which are
+        assimilated works expressed by a process analogous to cinematography;
+        a work of drawing, painting, architecture, sculpture, engraving or
+        lithography; a photographic work to which are assimilated works
+        expressed by a process analogous to photography; a work of applied
+        art; an illustration, map, plan, sketch or three-dimensional work
+        relative to geography, topography, architecture or science; a
+        performance; a broadcast; a phonogram; a compilation of data to the
+        extent it is protected as a copyrightable work; or a work performed by
+        a variety or circus performer to the extent it is not otherwise
+        considered a literary or artistic work.
+     g. "You" means an individual or entity exercising rights under this
+        License who has not previously violated the terms of this License with
+        respect to the Work, or who has received express permission from the
+        Licensor to exercise rights under this License despite a previous
+        violation.
+     h. "Publicly Perform" means to perform public recitations of the Work and
+        to communicate to the public those public recitations, by any means or
+        process, including by wire or wireless means or public digital
+        performances; to make available to the public Works in such a way that
+        members of the public may access these Works from a place and at a
+        place individually chosen by them; to perform the Work to the public
+        by any means or process and the communication to the public of the
+        performances of the Work, including by public digital performance; to
+        broadcast and rebroadcast the Work by any means including signs,
+        sounds or images.
+     i. "Reproduce" means to make copies of the Work by any means including
+        without limitation by sound or visual recordings and the right of
+        fixation and reproducing fixations of the Work, including storage of a
+        protected performance or phonogram in digital form or other electronic
+        medium.
+
+    2. Fair Dealing Rights. Nothing in this License is intended to reduce,
+    limit, or restrict any uses free from copyright or rights arising from
+    limitations or exceptions that are provided for in connection with the
+    copyright protection under copyright law or other applicable laws.
+
+    3. License Grant. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License,
+    Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive,
+    perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright) license to
+    exercise the rights in the Work as stated below:
+
+     a. to Reproduce the Work, to incorporate the Work into one or more
+        Collections, and to Reproduce the Work as incorporated in the
+        Collections;
+     b. to create and Reproduce Adaptations provided that any such Adaptation,
+        including any translation in any medium, takes reasonable steps to
+        clearly label, demarcate or otherwise identify that changes were made
+        to the original Work. For example, a translation could be marked "The
+        original work was translated from English to Spanish," or a
+        modification could indicate "The original work has been modified.";
+     c. to Distribute and Publicly Perform the Work including as incorporated
+        in Collections; and,
+     d. to Distribute and Publicly Perform Adaptations.
+     e. For the avoidance of doubt:
+
+         i. Non-waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions in
+            which the right to collect royalties through any statutory or
+            compulsory licensing scheme cannot be waived, the Licensor
+            reserves the exclusive right to collect such royalties for any
+            exercise by You of the rights granted under this License;
+        ii. Waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions in
+            which the right to collect royalties through any statutory or
+            compulsory licensing scheme can be waived, the Licensor waives the
+            exclusive right to collect such royalties for any exercise by You
+            of the rights granted under this License; and,
+       iii. Voluntary License Schemes. The Licensor waives the right to
+            collect royalties, whether individually or, in the event that the
+            Licensor is a member of a collecting society that administers
+            voluntary licensing schemes, via that society, from any exercise
+            by You of the rights granted under this License.
+
+    The above rights may be exercised in all media and formats whether now
+    known or hereafter devised. The above rights include the right to make
+    such modifications as are technically necessary to exercise the rights in
+    other media and formats. Subject to Section 8(f), all rights not expressly
+    granted by Licensor are hereby reserved.
+
+    4. Restrictions. The license granted in Section 3 above is expressly made
+    subject to and limited by the following restrictions:
+
+     a. You may Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work only under the terms
+        of this License. You must include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource
+        Identifier (URI) for, this License with every copy of the Work You
+        Distribute or Publicly Perform. You may not offer or impose any terms
+        on the Work that restrict the terms of this License or the ability of
+        the recipient of the Work to exercise the rights granted to that
+        recipient under the terms of the License. You may not sublicense the
+        Work. You must keep intact all notices that refer to this License and
+        to the disclaimer of warranties with every copy of the Work You
+        Distribute or Publicly Perform. When You Distribute or Publicly
+        Perform the Work, You may not impose any effective technological
+        measures on the Work that restrict the ability of a recipient of the
+        Work from You to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under
+        the terms of the License. This Section 4(a) applies to the Work as
+        incorporated in a Collection, but this does not require the Collection
+        apart from the Work itself to be made subject to the terms of this
+        License. If You create a Collection, upon notice from any Licensor You
+        must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Collection any credit
+        as required by Section 4(b), as requested. If You create an
+        Adaptation, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent
+        practicable, remove from the Adaptation any credit as required by
+        Section 4(b), as requested.
+     b. If You Distribute, or Publicly Perform the Work or any Adaptations or
+        Collections, You must, unless a request has been made pursuant to
+        Section 4(a), keep intact all copyright notices for the Work and
+        provide, reasonable to the medium or means You are utilizing: (i) the
+        name of the Original Author (or pseudonym, if applicable) if supplied,
+        and/or if the Original Author and/or Licensor designate another party
+        or parties (e.g., a sponsor institute, publishing entity, journal) for
+        attribution ("Attribution Parties") in Licensor's copyright notice,
+        terms of service or by other reasonable means, the name of such party
+        or parties; (ii) the title of the Work if supplied; (iii) to the
+        extent reasonably practicable, the URI, if any, that Licensor
+        specifies to be associated with the Work, unless such URI does not
+        refer to the copyright notice or licensing information for the Work;
+        and (iv) , consistent with Section 3(b), in the case of an Adaptation,
+        a credit identifying the use of the Work in the Adaptation (e.g.,
+        "French translation of the Work by Original Author," or "Screenplay
+        based on original Work by Original Author"). The credit required by
+        this Section 4 (b) may be implemented in any reasonable manner;
+        provided, however, that in the case of a Adaptation or Collection, at
+        a minimum such credit will appear, if a credit for all contributing
+        authors of the Adaptation or Collection appears, then as part of these
+        credits and in a manner at least as prominent as the credits for the
+        other contributing authors. For the avoidance of doubt, You may only
+        use the credit required by this Section for the purpose of attribution
+        in the manner set out above and, by exercising Your rights under this
+        License, You may not implicitly or explicitly assert or imply any
+        connection with, sponsorship or endorsement by the Original Author,
+        Licensor and/or Attribution Parties, as appropriate, of You or Your
+        use of the Work, without the separate, express prior written
+        permission of the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution
+        Parties.
+     c. Except as otherwise agreed in writing by the Licensor or as may be
+        otherwise permitted by applicable law, if You Reproduce, Distribute or
+        Publicly Perform the Work either by itself or as part of any
+        Adaptations or Collections, You must not distort, mutilate, modify or
+        take other derogatory action in relation to the Work which would be
+        prejudicial to the Original Author's honor or reputation. Licensor
+        agrees that in those jurisdictions (e.g. Japan), in which any exercise
+        of the right granted in Section 3(b) of this License (the right to
+        make Adaptations) would be deemed to be a distortion, mutilation,
+        modification or other derogatory action prejudicial to the Original
+        Author's honor and reputation, the Licensor will waive or not assert,
+        as appropriate, this Section, to the fullest extent permitted by the
+        applicable national law, to enable You to reasonably exercise Your
+        right under Section 3(b) of this License (right to make Adaptations)
+        but not otherwise.
+
+    5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer
+
+    UNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING, LICENSOR
+    OFFERS THE WORK AS-IS AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY
+    KIND CONCERNING THE WORK, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE,
+    INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTIBILITY,
+    FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF
+    LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS, ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF ERRORS,
+    WHETHER OR NOT DISCOVERABLE. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION
+    OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO SUCH EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
+
+    6. Limitation on Liability. EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE
+    LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR
+    ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES
+    ARISING OUT OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS
+    BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
+
+    7. Termination
+
+     a. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate
+        automatically upon any breach by You of the terms of this License.
+        Individuals or entities who have received Adaptations or Collections
+        from You under this License, however, will not have their licenses
+        terminated provided such individuals or entities remain in full
+        compliance with those licenses. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 will
+        survive any termination of this License.
+     b. Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted here is
+        perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright in the Work).
+        Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the right to release the
+        Work under different license terms or to stop distributing the Work at
+        any time; provided, however that any such election will not serve to
+        withdraw this License (or any other license that has been, or is
+        required to be, granted under the terms of this License), and this
+        License will continue in full force and effect unless terminated as
+        stated above.
+
+    8. Miscellaneous
+
+     a. Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work or a Collection,
+        the Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the Work on the same
+        terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this License.
+     b. Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform an Adaptation, Licensor
+        offers to the recipient a license to the original Work on the same
+        terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this License.
+     c. If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under
+        applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of
+        the remainder of the terms of this License, and without further action
+        by the parties to this agreement, such provision shall be reformed to
+        the minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and
+        enforceable.
+     d. No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and no
+        breach consented to unless such waiver or consent shall be in writing
+        and signed by the party to be charged with such waiver or consent.
+     e. This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with
+        respect to the Work licensed here. There are no understandings,
+        agreements or representations with respect to the Work not specified
+        here. Licensor shall not be bound by any additional provisions that
+        may appear in any communication from You. This License may not be
+        modified without the mutual written agreement of the Licensor and You.
+     f. The rights granted under, and the subject matter referenced, in this
+        License were drafted utilizing the terminology of the Berne Convention
+        for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works (as amended on
+        September 28, 1979), the Rome Convention of 1961, the WIPO Copyright
+        Treaty of 1996, the WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty of 1996
+        and the Universal Copyright Convention (as revised on July 24, 1971).
+        These rights and subject matter take effect in the relevant
+        jurisdiction in which the License terms are sought to be enforced
+        according to the corresponding provisions of the implementation of
+        those treaty provisions in the applicable national law. If the
+        standard suite of rights granted under applicable copyright law
+        includes additional rights not granted under this License, such
+        additional rights are deemed to be included in the License; this
+        License is not intended to restrict the license of any rights under
+        applicable law.
