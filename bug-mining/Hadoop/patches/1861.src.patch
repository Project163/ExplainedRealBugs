 This document describes how to configure Hadoop HTTP web-consoles to require user authentication.
 
-By default Hadoop HTTP web-consoles (JobTracker, NameNode, TaskTrackers and DataNodes) allow access without any form of authentication.
+By default Hadoop HTTP web-consoles (ResourceManager, NameNode, NodeManagers and DataNodes) allow access without any form of authentication.
 
 Hadoop HTTP web-consoles can be configured to require Kerberos authentication using HTTP SPNEGO protocol (supported by browsers like Firefox and Internet Explorer).
 
-In addition, Hadoop HTTP web-consoles support the equivalent of Hadoop's Pseudo/Simple authentication. If this option is enabled, the user name must be specified in the first browser interaction using the user.name query string parameter. e.g. `http://localhost:50030/jobtracker.jsp?user.name=babu`.
+In addition, Hadoop HTTP web-consoles support the equivalent of Hadoop's Pseudo/Simple authentication. If this option is enabled, the user name must be specified in the first browser interaction using the user.name query string parameter. e.g. `http://localhost:8088/cluster?user.name=babu`.
 
 If a custom authentication mechanism is required for the HTTP web-consoles, it is possible to implement a plugin to support the alternate authentication mechanism (refer to Hadoop hadoop-auth for details on writing an `AuthenticatorHandler`).
