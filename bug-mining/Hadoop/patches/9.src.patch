         -archiveName is the name of the archive you would like to create. 
         An example would be foo.har. The name should have a *.har extension. 
-        The inputs are file system pathnames which work as usual with regular
-        expressions. The destination directory would contain the archive.
+       	The parent argument is to specify the relative path to which the files should be
+       	archived to. Example would be :
+        </p><p><code> -p /foo/bar a/b/c e/f/g </code></p><p>
+        Here /foo/bar is the parent path and a/b/c, e/f/g are relative paths to parent. 
         Note that this is a Map/Reduce job that creates the archives. You would
-        need a map reduce cluster to run this. The following is an example:</p>
-        <p>
-        <code>hadoop archive -archiveName foo.har /user/hadoop/dir1 /user/hadoop/dir2 /user/zoo/</code>
-        </p><p>
-        In the above example /user/hadoop/dir1 and /user/hadoop/dir2 will be
-        archived in the following file system directory -- /user/zoo/foo.har.
-        The sources are not changed or removed when an archive is created.
-        </p>
+        need a map reduce cluster to run this. For a detailed example the later sections. </p>
+        <p> If you just want to archive a single directory /foo/bar then you can just use </p>

+        <title> Looking up files and understanding the -p option </title>
+		 <p> Looking up files in hadoop archives is as easy as doing an ls on the filesystem. After you have
+		 archived the directories /user/hadoop/dir1 and /user/hadoop/dir2 as in the exmaple above, to see all
+		 the files in the archives you can just run: </p>
+		 <p><code>hadoop dfs -lsr har:///user/zoo/foo.har/</code></p>
+		 <p> To understand the significance of the -p argument, lets go through the above example again. If you just do
+		 an ls (not lsr) on the hadoop archive using </p>
+		 <p><code>hadoop dfs -ls har:///user/zoo/foo.har</code></p>
+		 <p>The output should be:</p>
+		 <source>
+har:///user/zoo/foo.har/dir1
+har:///user/zoo/foo.har/dir2
+		 </source>
+		 <p> As you can recall the archives were created with the following command </p>
+        <p><code>hadoop archive -archiveName foo.har -p /user/hadoop dir1 dir2 /user/zoo </code></p>
+        <p> If we were to change the command to: </p>
+        <p><code>hadoop archive -archiveName foo.har -p /user/  hadoop/dir1 hadoop/dir2 /user/zoo </code></p>
+        <p> then a ls on the hadoop archive using </p>
+        <p><code>hadoop dfs -ls har:///user/zoo/foo.har</code></p>
+        <p>would give you</p>
+        <source>
+har:///user/zoo/foo.har/hadoop/dir1
+har:///user/zoo/foo.har/hadoop/dir2
+		</source>
+		<p>
+		Notice that the archived files have been archived relative to /user/ rather than /user/hadoop.

+		<title> Using Hadoop Archives with Map Reduce </title> 
+		<p>Using Hadoop Archives in Map Reduce is as easy as specifying a different input filesystem than the default file system.
+		If you have a hadoop archive stored in HDFS in /user/zoo/foo.har then for using this archive for Map Reduce input, all
+		you need to specify the input directory as har:///user/zoo/foo.har. Since Hadoop Archives is exposed as a file system 
+		Map Reduce will be able to use all the logical input files in Hadoop Archives as input.</p>
