 # A note about classpaths.
 #
-# The classpath is configured such that entries are stripped prior
-# to handing to Java based either upon duplication or non-existence.
-# Wildcards and/or directories are *NOT* expanded as the
-# de-duplication is fairly simple.  So if two directories are in
-# the classpath that both contain awesome-methods-1.0.jar,
-# awesome-methods-1.0.jar will still be seen by java.  But if
-# the classpath specifically has awesome-methods-1.0.jar from the
-# same directory listed twice, the last one will be removed.

-# An additional, custom CLASSPATH.  This is really meant for
-# end users, but as an administrator, one might want to push
-# something extra in here too, such as the jar to the topology
-# method.  Just be sure to append to the existing HADOOP_USER_CLASSPATH
-# so end users have a way to add stuff.

+# By default, Apache Hadoop overrides Java's CLASSPATH
+# environment variable.  It is configured such

+# a series of checks (file/dir exists, not already listed aka
+# de-deduplication).  During de-depulication, wildcards and/or
+# directories are *NOT* expanded to keep it simple. Therefore,

 The Apache Hadoop scripts have the capability to inject more content into the classpath of the running command by setting this environment variable.  It should be a colon delimited list of directories, files, or wildcard locations.
 
 ```bash
-HADOOP_USER_CLASSPATH=${HOME}/lib/myjars/*.jar hadoop classpath

 A user can provides hints to the location of the paths via the `HADOOP_USER_CLASSPATH_FIRST` variable.  Setting this to any value will tell the system to try and push these paths near the front.
