+     Blocker sub-task reported by Karthik Kambatla and fixed by Karthik Kambatla (resourcemanager)<br>
+     <b>RMDTRenewer#getRMClient should use ClientRMProxy</b><br>
+     <blockquote>RMDTRenewer#getRMClient gets a proxy to the RM in the conf directly instead of going through ClientRMProxy. 
+

+     Major bug reported by Aditya Acharya and fixed by Aditya Acharya (client)<br>
+     <b>Introduce timeout for async polling operations in YarnClientImpl</b><br>
+     <blockquote>I ran an MR2 application that would have been long running, and killed it programmatically using a YarnClient. The app was killed, but the client hung forever. The message that I saw, which spammed the logs, was "Watiting for application application_1389036507624_0018 to be killed."
+
+The RM log indicated that the app had indeed transitioned from RUNNING to KILLED, but for some reason future responses to the RPC to kill the application did not indicate that the app had been terminated.
+
+I tracked this down to YarnClientImpl.java, and though I was unable to reproduce the bug, I wrote a patch to introduce a bound on the number of times that YarnClientImpl retries the RPC before giving up.</blockquote></li>
+<li> <a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/YARN-1629">YARN-1629</a>.

+     Major bug reported by Aditya Acharya and fixed by Aditya Acharya (scheduler)<br>
+     <b>QueuePlacementPolicy format is not easily readable via a JAXB parser</b><br>
+     <blockquote>The current format for specifying queue placement rules in the fair scheduler allocations file does not lend itself to easy parsing via a JAXB parser. In particular, relying on the tag name to encode information about which rule to use makes it very difficult for an xsd-based JAXB parser to preserve the order of the rules, which is essential.</blockquote></li>

+<li> <a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/YARN-1618">YARN-1618</a>.
+     Blocker sub-task reported by Karthik Kambatla and fixed by Karthik Kambatla (resourcemanager)<br>
+     <b>Fix invalid RMApp transition from NEW to FINAL_SAVING</b><br>
+     <blockquote>YARN-891 augments the RMStateStore to store information on completed applications. In the process, it adds transitions from NEW to FINAL_SAVING. This leads to the RM trying to update entries in the state-store that do not exist. On ZKRMStateStore, this leads to the RM crashing. 
+
+Previous description:
+ZKRMStateStore fails to handle updates to znodes that don't exist. For instance, this can happen when an app transitions from NEW to FINAL_SAVING. In these cases, the store should create the missing znode and handle the update.</blockquote></li>

+<li> <a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/YARN-1601">YARN-1601</a>.
+     Major bug reported by Alejandro Abdelnur and fixed by Alejandro Abdelnur <br>
+     <b>3rd party JARs are missing from hadoop-dist output</b><br>
+     <blockquote>With the build changes of YARN-888 we are leaving out all 3rd party JArs used directly by YARN under /share/hadoop/yarn/lib/.
+
+We did not notice this when running minicluster because they all happen to be in the classpath from hadoop-common and hadoop-yarn.
+
+As 3d party JARs are not 'public' interfaces we cannot rely on them being provided to yarn by common and hdfs. (ie if common and hdfs stop using a 3rd party dependency that yarn uses this would break yarn if yarn does not pull that dependency explicitly).
+
+Also, this will break bigtop hadoop build when they move to use branch-2 as they expect to find jars in /share/hadoop/yarn/lib/</blockquote></li>

+     <blockquote>Currently, we move rmDispatcher out of ActiveService. But we still register the Event dispatcher, such as schedulerDispatcher, RMAppEventDispatcher when we initiate the ActiveService.
+
+Almost every time when we transit RM from Active to Standby,  we need to initiate the ActiveService. That means we will register the same event Dispatcher which will cause the same event will be handled several times.</blockquote></li>

+{quote}
+We should move to creating a node hierarchy for apps such that all znodes for an app are stored under an app znode instead of the app root znode. This will help in removeApplication and also in scaling better on ZK. The earlier code was written this way to ensure create/delete happens under a root znode for fencing. But given that we have moved to multi-operations globally, this isnt required anymore.

+     Major new feature reported by Wei Yan and fixed by Wei Yan (scheduler)<br>
+     <b>Yarn Scheduler Load Simulator</b><br>
+     <blockquote>The Yarn Scheduler is a fertile area of interest with different implementations, e.g., Fifo, Capacity and Fair  schedulers. Meanwhile, several optimizations are also made to improve scheduler performance for different scenarios and workload. Each scheduler algorithm has its own set of features, and drives scheduling decisions by many factors, such as fairness, capacity guarantee, resource availability, etc. It is very important to evaluate a scheduler algorithm very well before we deploy it in a production cluster. Unfortunately, currently it is non-trivial to evaluate a scheduling algorithm. Evaluating in a real cluster is always time and cost consuming, and it is also very hard to find a large-enough cluster. Hence, a simulator which can predict how well a scheduler algorithm for some specific workload would be quite useful.
+
+We want to build a Scheduler Load Simulator to simulate large-scale Yarn clusters and application loads in a single machine. This would be invaluable in furthering Yarn by providing a tool for researchers and developers to prototype new scheduler features and predict their behavior and performance with reasonable amount of confidence, there-by aiding rapid innovation.
+
+The simulator will exercise the real Yarn ResourceManager removing the network factor by simulating NodeManagers and ApplicationMasters via handling and dispatching NM/AMs heartbeat events from within the same JVM.
+
+To keep tracking of scheduler behavior and performance, a scheduler wrapper will wrap the real scheduler.
+
+The simulator will produce real time metrics while executing, including:
+
+* Resource usages for whole cluster and each queue, which can be utilized to configure cluster and queue's capacity.
+* The detailed application execution trace (recorded in relation to simulated time), which can be analyzed to understand/validate the  scheduler behavior (individual jobs turn around time, throughput, fairness, capacity guarantee, etc).
+* Several key metrics of scheduler algorithm, such as time cost of each scheduler operation (allocate, handle, etc), which can be utilized by Hadoop developers to find the code spots and scalability limits.
+
+The simulator will provide real time charts showing the behavior of the scheduler and its performance.
+
+A short demo is available http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6thLi8q0qLE, showing how to use simulator to simulate Fair Scheduler and Capacity Scheduler.</blockquote></li>

+All schedulers maintain a mapping of queues to applications.  I think it would make more sense to ask the schedulers which applications are in a given queue. This is what was done in MR1. This would also have the advantage of allowing a parent queue to return all the applications on leaf queues under it, and allow queue name aliases, as in the way that "root.default" and "default" refer to the same queue in the fair scheduler.

+The flow to update node's resource and awareness in resource scheduling is: 
+1. Resource update is through admin API to RM and take effect on RMNodeImpl.
+2. When next NM heartbeat for updating status comes, the RMNode's resource change will be aware and the delta resource is added to schedulerNode's availableResource before actual scheduling happens.
+3. Scheduler do resource allocation according to new availableResource in SchedulerNode.

+     <blockquote>Addition of FixedLengthInputFormat and FixedLengthRecordReader in the org.apache.hadoop.mapreduce.lib.input package. These two classes can be used when you need to read data from files containing fixed length (fixed width) records. Such files have no CR/LF (or any combination thereof), no delimiters etc, but each record is a fixed length, and extra data is padded with spaces. The data is one gigantic line within a file. When creating a job that specifies this input format, the job must have the "mapreduce.input.fixedlengthinputformat.record.length" property set as follows myJobConf.setInt("mapreduce.input.fixedlengthinputformat.record.length",[myFixedRecordLength]);

+- HTTP_ONLY : Service is provided only on http
+- HTTPS_ONLY : Service is provided only on https
+- HTTP_AND_HTTPS : Service is provided both on http and https
+
+hadoop.ssl.enabled and dfs.https.enabled are deprecated. When the deprecated configuration properties are still configured, currently http policy is decided based on the following rules:
+1. If dfs.http.policy is set to HTTPS_ONLY or HTTP_AND_HTTPS. It picks the specified policy, otherwise it proceeds to 2~4.
+2. It picks HTTPS_ONLY if hadoop.ssl.enabled equals to true.
+3. It picks HTTP_AND_HTTPS if dfs.https.enable equals to true.

+     <b>Filesystem Implementation for OpenStack Swift</b><br>
+     <blockquote>Added file system implementation for OpenStack Swift.
+There are two implementation: block and native (similar to Amazon S3 integration).
+Data locality issue solved by patch in Swift, commit procedure to OpenStack is in progress.
+
+To use implementation add to core-site.xml following:
+...
+	&lt;property&gt;
+	        &lt;name&gt;fs.swift.impl&lt;/name&gt;
+	    	&lt;value&gt;com.mirantis.fs.SwiftFileSystem&lt;/value&gt;
+	&lt;/property&gt;
+	&lt;property&gt;
+	    	&lt;name&gt;fs.swift.block.impl&lt;/name&gt;
+	         &lt;value&gt;com.mirantis.fs.block.SwiftBlockFileSystem&lt;/value&gt;
+        &lt;/property&gt;
+...
+
+In MapReduce job specify following configs for OpenStack Keystone authentication:
+conf.set("swift.auth.url", "http://172.18.66.117:5000/v2.0/tokens");
+conf.set("swift.tenant", "superuser");
+conf.set("swift.username", "admin1");
+conf.set("swift.password", "password");
