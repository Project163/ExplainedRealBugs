-* Blocked Access Control ListsIn some cases, it is required to specify blocked access control list for a service. This specifies the list of users and groups who are not authorized to access the service. The format of the blocked access control list is same as that of access control list. The blocked access control list can be specified via `$HADOOP_CONF_DIR/hadoop-policy.xml`. The property name is derived by suffixing with ".blocked".

+### Access Control using Lists of IP Addresses, Host Names and IP Ranges
+
+Access to a service can be controlled based on the ip address of the client accessing the service. It is possible to restrict access to a service from a set of machines by specifying a list of ip addresses, host names and ip ranges. The property name for each service is derived from the corresponding acl's property name. If the property name of acl is security.client.protocol.acl, property name for the hosts list will be security.client.protocol.hosts.
