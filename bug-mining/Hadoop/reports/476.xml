            <title>[HADOOP-6502] DistributedFileSystem#listStatus is very slow when listing a directory with a size of 1300</title>
                <link>https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HADOOP-6502</link>
                <project id="12310240" key="HADOOP">Hadoop Common</project>
                    <description>&lt;p&gt;When listing a directory of around 1300 children, it takes hundreds of milliseconds. It turns out the slowdowness is caused by the change made by &lt;a href=&quot;https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HADOOP-4187&quot; title=&quot;Create a MapReduce-specific ReflectionUtils that handles JobConf and JobConfigurable&quot; class=&quot;issue-link&quot; data-issue-key=&quot;HADOOP-4187&quot;&gt;&lt;del&gt;HADOOP-4187&lt;/del&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The return value of listStatus is an array of FileStatus. When deserializing each element of the array, ReflectionUtils#newInstance(Class&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;, Configuration) is called and then calls setConf, which calls setJobConf. SetJobConf checks if JobConf is on the class path by calling Configuration#getClassByName. Even though Configuration#getClassByName tries to optimize the lookup using a cached map, but since JobConf is not in the class path, so it is not in the cache. Every checkup ends up calling Class.ForName which is very expensive. Deserializing an array of 1300 entries requires calling of Class#ForName 1300 times!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

                            <comment id="12803759" author="cutting" created="Fri, 22 Jan 2010 16:55:17 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;I don&apos;t think it&apos;s appropriate to cache JVM state in the configuration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think we can better fix this by changing Configuration#getClassByName() to cache failures as well as successes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; Will we ever have a case where the JobConf isn&apos;t in the classpath once, and then later shows up because the classloader changed?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The cache in Configuration is per-classloader.  So as long as we go through that we should be safe.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="12803814" author="szetszwo" created="Fri, 22 Jan 2010 18:45:35 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;DistributedFileSystem#listStatus requires checking the JobConf class.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The above statement sounds totally wrong to me.  If mapreduce needs a special ReflectionUtils, why don&apos;t we add one in mapreduce?&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="12803823" author="tlipcon" created="Fri, 22 Jan 2010 19:07:17 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;Nicholas: the problem is that ReflectionUtils.getInstance gets called by common code in Configuration. MapReduce wouldn&apos;t just need its own ReflectionUtils, it would also need its own Configuration, no?&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="12803826" author="szetszwo" created="Fri, 22 Jan 2010 19:13:18 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;Since JobConf extends Configuration, could JobConf override the common codes ?&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="12803834" author="tlipcon" created="Fri, 22 Jan 2010 19:23:46 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;Actually, after thinking some more, even that wouldn&apos;t work. There&apos;s lots of Common code that uses ReflectionUtils.newInstance, for example the serialziation stuff which instantiates writables. A user is free to make their writables JobConfigurable, etc. I don&apos;t think there&apos;s a particularly simple solution here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The cache in Configuration is per-classloader. So as long as we go through that we should be safe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we make the assumption that classloaders never pick up new classes, that&apos;s true. But I don&apos;t think the JVM has a negative class cache, does it? That is, if you try to load a class when it doesn&apos;t exist, then move the class into the classpath and try to load again, it might pick it up.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="12803852" author="cutting" created="Fri, 22 Jan 2010 20:02:16 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; If we make the assumption that classloaders never pick up new classes, that&apos;s true.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am happy to make that assumption.  I don&apos;t think dynamically adding classes to a class path as an application runs is a pattern we need to support.  Consider the case where you place a different definition earlier in the classpath.  No cache would pick that up.  Caching negatives seems like a very small step beyond that.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="12803853" author="tlipcon" created="Fri, 22 Jan 2010 20:04:17 +0000"  >&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I don&apos;t think dynamically adding classes to a class path as an application runs is a pattern we need to support.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I tend to agree. Steve Loughran - you out there? I think you probably are the one doing the wackiest stuff with classloaders and Hadoop &lt;img class=&quot;emoticon&quot; src=&quot;https://issues.apache.org/jira/images/icons/emoticons/smile.png&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; width=&quot;16&quot; align=&quot;absmiddle&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="12803862" author="steve_l" created="Fri, 22 Jan 2010 20:50:47 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Disclaimer&lt;/em&gt; I have long advocated having a ASF exam in classloaders; nobody who hasn&apos;t passed the exam would be allowed to mess with classloaders in any apache project. As there is no such exam, there is no proof that I can be considered competent enough to do this, and you should treat everything I say with caution. Test my statements, preferably in JUnit methods.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1.  Adding new classes is generally rare unless you are running something that is generating java classes on the fly; JSP compilers do this. Even then, they try not to mess around with things higher up the hierarchy (exception, JBoss default classloader, the one that&apos;s broken that everyone hates).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2. Modern, OSGi-style classloaders are fairly strict, I don&apos;t think they add stuff higher up. More of a general concern when you play with classloader trees are&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;it&apos;s easy to leak classloaders. retain one ref to a class loaded by a child classloader and the classloader never gets GC&apos;d, doesn&apos;t pick up&lt;br/&gt;
updated JARs, consumes memory, stops your build overwriting any locked&lt;br/&gt;
JARs (windows only)&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;all the rules about singletons and equality goes out the window.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;


&lt;p&gt;3. I would go for caching the failure. For those people playing games with classloaders, tough. But do note that if the JSP engine does need to&lt;br/&gt;
compile a JSP class, then Hadoop is adding classes to some classpath&lt;br/&gt;
in the Hadoop JVM. So your tools may be doing what you don&apos;t think is&lt;br/&gt;
happening, even on a &quot;normal&quot; Hadoop instance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;4. Looking at the code in more detail, the things a bit of an ugly hack, a contrived workaround to avoid a cycle. If there was an elegant solution to this that didn&apos;t evolve reflection, things would be much better. Nothing obvious springs to mind. &lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="12803983" author="tomwhite" created="Sat, 23 Jan 2010 01:17:37 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; Looking at the code in more detail, the things a bit of an ugly hack, a contrived workaround to avoid a cycle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Remember that this workaround only needs to be supported until the deprecated JobConf class is removed, since the new API uses Configuration in its place.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="12804000" author="acmurthy" created="Sat, 23 Jan 2010 02:33:34 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;I had a discussion with Hairong about this one... &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The important thing to note is that listStatus as described in this jira &lt;b&gt;iff&lt;/b&gt; we are writing a stand-alone DFSClient without map-reduce jars in the classpath of the application. It is so because if JobConf/JobConfigurable are in the classpath the look-up is done only once and is cached in Configuration.getClassByName. I believe Hairong was running a stand-alone test where she did not have MR jars on the classpath.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, we cannot remove this feature from ReflectionUtils without breaking applications. I&apos;d propose we fix it by removing the offending code at the same time we remove the deprecated org.apache.hadoop.mapred package. Until then it affects a small minority of applications... even bin/hadoop commands are &apos;ok&apos; since MR jars are on the classpath. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However bin/hdfs might have this problem... sigh.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="12804020" author="cutting" created="Sat, 23 Jan 2010 05:39:50 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;Arun, do you see a problem with caching negatives in Configuration.getClassByName()?  This seems like it should fix this and perhaps other related issues.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="12804034" author="acmurthy" created="Sat, 23 Jan 2010 07:58:16 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;I don&apos;t see much of a problem with caching negatives, but I&apos;m not sure we need to anything here at all... I can go either way. &lt;b&gt;shrug&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="12804052" author="steve_l" created="Sat, 23 Jan 2010 09:25:03 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;you could always just cache the special case of JobConf not found, a single flag rather than adding special not-found entries to the weak&amp;lt;name, class&amp;gt; hashmap.  Then it becomes something that can be pulled when jobconf goes away, rather than another feature that needs to be retained forever because of the risk of other code relying on it. &lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="12804678" author="hairong" created="Mon, 25 Jan 2010 19:55:43 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; but I&apos;m not sure we need to anything here at all... &lt;br/&gt;
From the dfs point of view, of course, this should be fixed. It seems so weird that map/reduce related stuff would effect the performance of hdfs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;+1 caching negatives. This should in general improve newInstance performance in the failure case. &lt;/p&gt;</comment>

&lt;p&gt;This is a performance fix. As indicated above, the IPC benchmark from &lt;a href=&quot;https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HADOOP-8070&quot; title=&quot;Add standalone benchmark of protobuf IPC&quot; class=&quot;issue-link&quot; data-issue-key=&quot;HADOOP-8070&quot;&gt;&lt;del&gt;HADOOP-8070&lt;/del&gt;&lt;/a&gt; went from ~2k RPC/sec to ~30k RPC/sec with this patch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, I checked the classpath of a running NN and noted that it does not have the MR jars on its classpath. So, this bug does affect actual NNs in 0.23+&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
