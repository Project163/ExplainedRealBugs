                    <description>&lt;p&gt;DiskChecker.checkDir uses File.canRead, File.canWrite, and File.canExecute to check if a directory is inaccessible.  These APIs are not reliable on Windows with NTFS ACLs due to a known JVM bug.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

                            <comment id="13483589" author="cnauroth" created="Wed, 24 Oct 2012 21:00:13 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;Here is the JVM bug report:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://bugs.sun.com/bugdatabase/view_bug.do?bug_id=6203387&quot; class=&quot;external-link&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;http://bugs.sun.com/bugdatabase/view_bug.do?bug_id=6203387&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was closed as Won&apos;t Fix with suggestions to code work-arounds that involve actually attempting file system operations or using JNI to call a Windows API.  The bug report also says that the new file APIs in JDK7 will address this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem is visible when running TestDiskChecker, which fails on Windows.  I suspect no one noticed the problem on branch-1-win, because that version of the code does not have a test suite for DiskChecker.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="13483593" author="cnauroth" created="Wed, 24 Oct 2012 21:08:31 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;I&apos;ve uploaded a tentative patch that takes the approach of actually trying to do file system operations in addition to checking File.canRead, File.canWrite, and File.canExecute.  The new checks are only executed on Windows.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&apos;ll also investigate the feasibility of a JNI call to a Windows API.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&apos;m assuming that an upgrade to Java 7 to use the new file APIs is going to take us a while, so not feasible for the short term.  (Please correct me if I&apos;m wrong about that though.)&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="13483599" author="cnauroth" created="Wed, 24 Oct 2012 21:14:43 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;One other note on that patch: I also noticed a bug in TestDiskChecker.java.  The _checkDirs helper method was not using the isDir flag.  This meant that the test case testCheckDir_notDir_local was not really testing what it intended.  I updated _checkDirs to make use of the flag.  If isDir is true, then the test runs against a directory.  If isDir is false, then the test runs against a file.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of these tests pass on Mac and Windows with this patch.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>

There are a bunch of impliesRead(), impliesWrite() functions that tell whether a given FsPermission object allows read/write etc. I am sorry I don&apos;t remember where these functions are.&lt;br/&gt;

                            <comment id="13487999" author="cnauroth" created="Wed, 31 Oct 2012 17:42:05 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;I see FsAction.implies(FsAction), which for example can be used to check that &quot;rw-&quot; implies &quot;r-&lt;del&gt;&quot; but does not imply &quot;&lt;/del&gt;-x&quot;.  Is this what you had in mind?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is this structure sufficient to cover NTFS ACLs?  It seems like this would cover checks of UNIX-style permissions + file ownership, but then an NTFS ACL could still disallow.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="13488471" author="bikassaha" created="Thu, 1 Nov 2012 05:16:20 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;On branch-1-win internally winutils would be used to infer the Windows ACL&apos;s into rwx permissions. If those changes have been ported over then it should work on Windows too. Other places use similar logic which can be checked by looking for references to the FsAction.implies() method.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>

There had been an earlier round of feedback on this patch that suggested trying a different approach.  I haven&apos;t had a chance to investigate it and try it.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="13592734" author="cnauroth" created="Mon, 4 Mar 2013 22:21:20 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;Here was the last discussion on this issue:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Can we try the following approach that has the advantage of being common across platforms.&lt;br/&gt;
Get FileStatus of the file/dir using FileSystem API&lt;br/&gt;
getPermission() from FileStatus&lt;br/&gt;
There are a bunch of impliesRead(), impliesWrite() functions that tell whether a given FsPermission object allows read/write etc. I am sorry I don&apos;t remember where these functions are.&lt;br/&gt;
Using these functions one can get the equivalent of isReadable/isWritable&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Digging into this, unfortunately no, we cannot reconstruct the logic of &lt;tt&gt;DiskChecker&lt;/tt&gt; in a cross-platform way by using &lt;tt&gt;FsPermission&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;FsAction&lt;/tt&gt; (with delegation to winutils ls when running on Windows).  The reason that methods like &lt;tt&gt;File#canRead&lt;/tt&gt; are used here is that it checks if the current process can read the file, with full consideration of the specific user that launched the process.  Our &lt;tt&gt;FsPermission&lt;/tt&gt; model considers permissions, but it does not consider how those permissions map to specific users (nor would it be trivial to expand it to include this information).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, using &lt;tt&gt;FsPermission&lt;/tt&gt; + winutils ls, we could see that a particular directory has permissions 770, so the owner and members of the primary group have full access to this directory.  If the user that launched the process is either the owner or a member of the primary group, then &lt;tt&gt;DiskChecker&lt;/tt&gt; must report that the disk is usable.  If not, then &lt;tt&gt;DiskChecker&lt;/tt&gt; must report that the disk is unusable.  However, &lt;tt&gt;DiskChecker&lt;/tt&gt; doesn&apos;t have enough information to choose the correct result.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It would be error-prone to go down the path of trying to duplicate the exact permission checking logic enforced by the OS on the local file system.  You might argue that we could solve the example above by trying to combine more calls to get the primary group and check if the current user&apos;s groups include that group.  However, that wouldn&apos;t be sufficient to cover more complex rules enforced by local file systems, such as POSIX ACLs.  It would be challenging to get this exactly right, and since the logic is different on different OSes, it wouldn&apos;t satisfy the goal of trying to keep this layer of code platform-agnostic anyway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I propose that we accept the patch I wrote earlier, still attached to the jira, so that &lt;tt&gt;DiskChecker&lt;/tt&gt; actually attempts a few file system operations for verification when running on Windows.  These work-arounds could be removed whenever Hadoop upgrades to JDK7.  Then, we can rewrite &lt;tt&gt;DiskChecker&lt;/tt&gt; to use the new Java &lt;tt&gt;FileSystem&lt;/tt&gt; API, which doesn&apos;t have these bugs.  I&apos;ve confirmed that the existing patch still applies cleanly to branch-trunk-win and fixes &lt;tt&gt;TestDiskChecker&lt;/tt&gt; so that it passes on both Mac and Windows.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="13592795" author="bikassaha" created="Mon, 4 Mar 2013 23:31:40 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;During Datanode startup it checks if the data dir permissions are 755. Using the above logic, is there a hole in that check too because it does not imply that Datanode has permission to read and write to that directory? DiskChecker is used to perform that check too using another checkDir() method.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="13592830" author="cnauroth" created="Tue, 5 Mar 2013 00:07:01 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;That&apos;s interesting.  Yes, I believe this is a bug in the existing code for the other overload of &lt;tt&gt;DiskChecker#checkDir&lt;/tt&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, suppose a dfs.datanode.data.dir on the local file system with owner &quot;foo&quot; and perms set to 700.  Now suppose we launch datanode as user &quot;bar&quot;.  &lt;tt&gt;DiskChecker#checkDir&lt;/tt&gt; will just look for 700 and not consider the running user, so it will think that the directory is usable.  Then, it would experience an I/O error later whenever the process first tries to use that directory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&apos;ll file a separate jira for this.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="13592877" author="bikassaha" created="Tue, 5 Mar 2013 00:56:32 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;Well. In that case, it would be a standard pattern everywhere because everywhere code simply checks the value of the permissions and not whether the process checking that value actually has the right membership wrt that value. Isnt it so? Irrespective of OS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, one can make a case that checkDir(File dir) should end up calling checkDir(FileSystem, FilePath, &quot;rwx&quot;) instead of duplicating the logic.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="13592904" author="arpitagarwal" created="Tue, 5 Mar 2013 01:33:04 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;+1 on the approach for its simplicity. It is sound to check for permissions in this way and we should do the same on other platforms. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few comments on the code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Are there any bugs other than the one you link below? I wonder if dir.canRead can return false when it should return true. We should skip this call on Windows if it is known to be broken. Same for dir.canWrite and dir.canExecute.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;code panel&quot; style=&quot;border-width: 1px;&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;codeContent panelContent&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;code-java&quot;&gt;    &lt;span class=&quot;code-comment&quot;&gt;// This method contains several workarounds to known JVM bugs that cause
&lt;/span&gt;    &lt;span class=&quot;code-comment&quot;&gt;// File.canRead, File.canWrite, and File.canExecute to &lt;span class=&quot;code-keyword&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; incorrect
&lt;/span&gt;    &lt;span class=&quot;code-comment&quot;&gt;// results on Windows with NTFS ACLs.
&lt;/span&gt;    &lt;span class=&quot;code-comment&quot;&gt;// http://bugs.sun.com/bugdatabase/view_bug.&lt;span class=&quot;code-keyword&quot;&gt;do&lt;/span&gt;?bug_id=6203387&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Does this change the current directory of the calling process?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;code panel&quot; style=&quot;border-width: 1px;&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;codeContent panelContent&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;code-java&quot;&gt;        &lt;span class=&quot;code-object&quot;&gt;String&lt;/span&gt;[] cdCmd = &lt;span class=&quot;code-keyword&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;code-object&quot;&gt;String&lt;/span&gt;[] { &lt;span class=&quot;code-quote&quot;&gt;&quot;cmd&quot;&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class=&quot;code-quote&quot;&gt;&quot;/C&quot;&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class=&quot;code-quote&quot;&gt;&quot;cd&quot;&lt;/span&gt;,
            dir.getAbsolutePath() };
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="13592918" author="ivanmi" created="Tue, 5 Mar 2013 01:38:40 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;Thanks Chris for the patch. I am fine with the current patch, but would still like to reiterate on Bikas&apos; question on why we cannot use impliesRead/impliesWrite etc. At this point, we already assume the POSIX like semantic in Hadoop across the board (this is why we have winutils). Leveriging winutils in CheckDisk would provide a nice symmetry in the test.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You bring up a good point about not completely covering the NTFS ACLs space. I think this is fine for now. Eventually, as we improve, we can think of good ways to abstract this out, but this goes way beyond today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me know what you think.&lt;/p&gt;

                            <comment id="13592931" author="chuanliu" created="Tue, 5 Mar 2013 01:50:46 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;I want to chime in a little on this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; The reason that methods like File#canRead are used here is that it checks if the current process can read the file, with full consideration of the specific user that launched the process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chris, I think it should be relatively easy to provide some API like this either through winutils or JNI. In Windows (and the new POSIX ACL mode), file owner and file ACL are separate concepts (comparing with traditional chmod file permission mode where the first 3 bit are tightly associated with the file owner). In &quot;winutils ls&quot;, we retrieval effective rights for the owner through the API call GetEffectiveRightsForSid() where Sid is the user sid that we want to check access permissions. Calling this API with a given user SID, we should be able to get its permission on the file.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I notice we already have the &quot;getfacl&quot; command line utility on Linux. What do you think we provide a simple one in &quot;winutils&quot;? E.g. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;code panel&quot; style=&quot;border-width: 1px;&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;codeContent panelContent&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;code-java&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;winutils getfacl -u [username] file
user:[username]:r-x
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="13592988" author="bikassaha" created="Tue, 5 Mar 2013 02:57:12 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;Thats is a good idea to do if we need to find out if the current process user has certain permissions. But I guess the point we are debating on currently is whether we can make checkDisk(File) do what checkDisk(FS, Path, Perm) does. Perhaps by simply calling the second function. If checkDisk(FS, Path, Perm) meets our other needs then it should be enough. I think currently, the code checks for expected permissions, implicitly assuming the daemon processes to be running as the users who are supposed to have those permissions.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="13593055" author="cnauroth" created="Tue, 5 Mar 2013 04:10:24 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;Thanks for the comments, everyone.  This is very helpful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Does this change the current directory of the calling process?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No, this forks a whole new process, and runs the cd within that process.  The working directory of the calling process is unchanged.  I think this is safe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leveriging winutils in CheckDisk would provide a nice symmetry in the test.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chris, I think it should be relatively easy to provide some API like this either through winutils or JNI.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On all of the other discussion points, I think the summary is that we have discovered that there are deficiencies in the current logic of &lt;tt&gt;DiskChecker&lt;/tt&gt;, and it&apos;s not a problem specific to Windows.  It&apos;s a problem on Linux too.  Considering this, I&apos;d still like to proceed with the basic approach in the current patch.  We can file a follow-up jira to fix the problem more completely, with full consideration for other permission models that include things like POSIX ACLs and NTFS ACLs.  (My opinion is that we should just wait for JDK7 instead of investing in JNI calls, but that&apos;s just my opinon.)  The scope of this follow-up jira would include both Linux and Windows.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Arpit had provided some feedback on the actual code, and I do want to provide a new patch to address that feedback.  I&apos;m planning on uploading a new patch tomorrow.  If anyone disagrees with the approach though, please let me know so that I don&apos;t waste time preparing a patch that is objectionable.  &lt;img class=&quot;emoticon&quot; src=&quot;https://issues.apache.org/jira/images/icons/emoticons/smile.png&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; width=&quot;16&quot; align=&quot;absmiddle&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well. In that case, it would be a standard pattern everywhere because everywhere code simply checks the value of the permissions and not whether the process checking that value actually has the right membership wrt that value. Isnt it so? Irrespective of OS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&apos;m reluctant to change the code so that the permission checks are less comprehensive on Linux for the sake of cross-platform consistency.  Right now, we have one overload of &lt;tt&gt;DiskChecker#checkDir&lt;/tt&gt; that is correct AFAIK, and another overload of &lt;tt&gt;DiskChecker#checkDir&lt;/tt&gt; that is incomplete when considering more sophisticated permission models on the local file system, like POSIX ACLs.  The approach in the current patch at least achieves consistent behavior between Linux and Windows, so at least we have symmetry with regards to that.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="13593691" author="cnauroth" created="Tue, 5 Mar 2013 18:08:43 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;I&apos;m attaching an updated patch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We should skip this call on Windows if it is known to be broken.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each check in the new patch now has this form: if (Windows) then do special check else do File.canRead/canWrite/canExecute, so we bypass the broken File APIs on Windows but still use them on Linux where they are known to work correctly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Does this change the current directory of the calling process?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I added a comment explaining that it launches a separate process and does not change the working directory of the current process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks!&lt;/p&gt;</comment>

&lt;p&gt;This patch works for functional parity with Linux/OSX.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&apos;t see a reason to keep the second overload of checkDir. As long as the check is performed by the DataNode process, Chris&apos;s approach is simple and portable across all permission schemes. We should file a separate Jira to address the overload.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="13593760" author="bikassaha" created="Tue, 5 Mar 2013 18:51:46 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;I dont have a preference either way on how this we perform the check. What I dont want is to see 2 code paths do different things for what should essentially be the same operation. It is confusing, inconsistent and not good to maintain. So please make both versions of checkDirs consistent, ideally without code duplication.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now the question of how the check is done. It seems to me that what checkDir(FS, Path, Perm) is doing is sufficient for our use cases. The code to check permissions via the &quot;implies&quot; functions are used in a number of places in the code. What I am trying to understand is why the check is sufficient/correct for all those cases and not here. If there is an issue in that logic then we have issues in a number of critical places in the code which should be fixed. Its more than a question of cross-platform compatibility. If there is no issue that logic then its not clear why we need to do something different for this particular case. Does this make my questions clear?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We need to be careful about the performance impact of how the check is done. I see a number of places that call checkDirs() method for a collection of directories. Do we want to write to a temp file for all those cases in order to check for writability?&lt;/p&gt;</comment>

&lt;p&gt;So please make both versions of checkDirs consistent, ideally without code duplication.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Definitely agreed.  Can we please keep the scope of this jira limited to Windows compatibility for the current logic?  Arpit has already filed &lt;a href=&quot;https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HADOOP-9367&quot; title=&quot;Consider combining the implementations of DiskChecker.checkDir for all supported platforms&quot; class=&quot;issue-link&quot; data-issue-key=&quot;HADOOP-9367&quot;&gt;HADOOP-9367&lt;/a&gt; for follow-up on the existing flaws in the code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems to me that what checkDir(FS, Path, Perm) is doing is sufficient for our use cases.  The code to check permissions via the &quot;implies&quot; functions are used in a number of places in the code. What I am trying to understand is why the check is sufficient/correct for all those cases and not here. If there is an issue in that logic then we have issues in a number of critical places in the code which should be fixed. Its more than a question of cross-platform compatibility. If there is no issue that logic then its not clear why we need to do something different for this particular case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are 2 broad categories of usage for &lt;tt&gt;FsAction#implies&lt;/tt&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Inside the implementation of the HDFS permission model.  This includes things like &lt;tt&gt;FSDirectory&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;FSPermissionChecker&lt;/tt&gt;.  In this case, the logic of &lt;tt&gt;FsAction#implies&lt;/tt&gt; is sufficient, because we know that this is the only kind of permission model supported by HDFS.  It doesn&apos;t support ACLs (at least not yet).&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;In various places that need to interact with local disk.  This includes things like &lt;tt&gt;NameNode&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;DataNode&lt;/tt&gt; initialization, &lt;tt&gt;ClientDistributedCacheManager&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;FSDownload&lt;/tt&gt;.  In these cases, the logic of &lt;tt&gt;FsAction#implies&lt;/tt&gt; is incomplete, because it doesn&apos;t cover all possible permission checks that might be enforced on the local disk by the host OS, such as ACLs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I believe this is the key distinction: HDFS (full permission model under our control) vs. local disk (permission model partially invisible to our code).  I&apos;m starting to think that instead of &lt;tt&gt;FsAction#implies&lt;/tt&gt;, we need to write a wrapper API that looks more like &lt;tt&gt;access&lt;/tt&gt; from unistd.h, and route all local disk interactions through that instead of &lt;tt&gt;FsAction#implies&lt;/tt&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://linux.die.net/man/2/access&quot; class=&quot;external-link&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;http://linux.die.net/man/2/access&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This API just says &quot;tell me if I can read/write/execute this file&quot;.  It encapsulates the caller from the implementation details of the permission model.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again though, I think this is far out of scope for the current issue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We need to be careful about the performance impact of how the check is done&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I believe the lists of directories to check are small in practice: things like dfs.namenode.name.dir, dfs.datanode.data.dir, yarn.nodemanager.local-dirs.  Also, there is no performance regression on Linux, because this logic is guarded in an if (WINDOWS) check.  After migration to Java 7, even Windows won&apos;t need to do this.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="13594927" author="bikassaha" created="Wed, 6 Mar 2013 18:20:00 +0000"  >&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Can we please keep the scope of this jira limited to Windows compatibility for the current logic?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not until we clearly understand what the flaw is that we are trying to fix. It this was branch-1 then I would agree. But on trunk we have the flexibility of not making stop-gap changes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As far as the permissions is concerned. I think Hadoop really depends on a Unix like rwx permission model on the local disk. This is in theory unrelated to the permission model HFDS itself imposes for its own filesystem and which also happens to be the rwx model. This is the main reason why we wrote the winutil layer that exposes the rwx model on top of Windows ACL&apos;s for local disk. Thats why I am trying to understand why we need different checks here because it may imply that our translation layer is not working.&lt;br/&gt;
Your analysis might be correct and I would like an HDFS expert like &lt;a href=&quot;https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/ViewProfile.jspa?name=sanjay.radia&quot; class=&quot;user-hover&quot; rel=&quot;sanjay.radia&quot;&gt;sanjay.radia&lt;/a&gt; to take a look.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This jira was opened because TestDiskChecker was failing right? Would you be kind enough to change checkDir(File) to use the same logic as checkDir(FS, Path, perm) and check if the test passes? Hopefully the change will be small and wont take much of your time. It will help ascertain if the implies function will work or not.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="13594968" author="bikassaha" created="Wed, 6 Mar 2013 18:50:50 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;I synced offline with Arpit. I now see why the implies may be incorrect for scenarios you mention. In that case, I would really like this patch to fix the other broken checkDir also because that is incorrect too and it doesnt make sense to fix the same bug in 2 patches. This would also need to be backported to branch-1.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>

Since the implementation changed, I also needed to switch some test code from using mocks to using real file system interactions.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>

Minor comment. I think we added a check for java version and have used it to enable java api&apos;s for java 7, if available. If java 7 File.canWrite etc are going to work on Windows (like mentioned in some comments above) then we could enable the API path when (!Windows or Java&amp;gt;6).&lt;br/&gt;
Please do open a jira to fix this issue in branch-1-win too.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>

&lt;p&gt;Sorry, let me clarify the Java 7 situation.  Java 7 does not fix the bugs in java.io.File canRead/canWrite/canExecute.  Instead, it adds new methods that are very similar in &lt;tt&gt;java.nio.file.Files&lt;/tt&gt;, and these new methods are the ones that correctly handle ACLs:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/nio/file/Files.html&quot; class=&quot;external-link&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/nio/file/Files.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&apos;m not sure why they didn&apos;t just fix the bugs in &lt;tt&gt;java.io.File&lt;/tt&gt;, but that&apos;s the way it is.  This means that it wouldn&apos;t be correct to do if (JDK7) then use File methods.  We have to wait for Hadoop as a whole go to JDK7 (for compile time, not just runtime) and migrate the &lt;tt&gt;DiskChecker&lt;/tt&gt; code to use the new APIs.  Unfortunately, we can&apos;t do anything right now in this patch to prepare for that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The old Sun bug report has some relevant discussion:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two comments:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;alternate&quot; type=&quot;square&quot;&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;I noticed that testCheckDir_notListable and testCheckDir_notListable_local fail on my machine (stacks are below, will take a look now) (hint: I am running as admin)&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;I would prefer that we make Shell#getSetPermissionCommand accept File instead of a string (we should do the same for other Shell methods that accept local paths, but this is orthogonal)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;+1 for this. I missed it but Ivan did not. Guess he has had to fix more cases of string-for-file issues than me &lt;img class=&quot;emoticon&quot; src=&quot;https://issues.apache.org/jira/images/icons/emoticons/tongue.png&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; width=&quot;16&quot; align=&quot;absmiddle&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</comment>

&lt;p&gt;I noticed that testCheckDir_notListable and testCheckDir_notListable_local fail on my machine (stacks are below, will take a look now) (hint: I am running as admin)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ivan, I would appreciate any help you can offer on this.  I can&apos;t repro the problem on my side, even when running as admin.  I&apos;m on Windows Server 2008 R2 64-bit (in case specific Windows version is causing a difference).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would prefer that we make Shell#getSetPermissionCommand accept File instead of a string (we should do the same for other Shell methods that accept local paths, but this is orthogonal)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please note that I am only merging an existing Shell method from trunk to branch-1-win.  If we make it accept File on branch-1-win, then we&apos;ll set ourselves up for merge conflicts later as we try to manage patches across the 2 branches.  If we change the trunk version, then it&apos;s going to break about 15 different call sites that have nothing to do with DiskChecker, so it&apos;s not appropriate to change the trunk version within the scope of this jira.  The safest option is to defer this change to a different jira for refactoring all of the Shell methods like you suggested.  Is there a jira for that yet?&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="13597704" author="arpitagarwal" created="Fri, 8 Mar 2013 23:54:21 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;I don&apos;t see any failures on Windows 2008 R2 64-bit either.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="13597799" author="ivanmi" created="Sat, 9 Mar 2013 02:02:21 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;OK, the issue we have is that winutils implicitly keeps all permissions for admins/system accounts to provide the similar semantics as root on linux (this is also needed from the scenario perspective as admins/system should be able to access all files). This means that the test now fails when executed in the admin context (since OS still allows admins to read/write/execute after &quot;chmod 000&quot;). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reason why the tests succeed on your boxes is most likely because you have User Account Control enabled on the machine (so you are not running as an effective admin).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Would be good to check if the test passes on Unix if executed in the context of the root?&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;If we go the POSIX route, we will have the expected results (&quot;chmod 000 admin&quot; will result in 000 when we &quot;ls&quot;). I attached a prototype patch just for demonstration. Let&apos;s think a bit more about what is the right longer term solution. I am actually leaning towards what you have in the patch, as that is the absolute truth about whether checkDir succeeded or failed. The downside is that the test now fails if executed with admin context. Would be good to know what is the unix behavior for root for symmetry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please note that I am only merging an existing Shell method from trunk to branch-1-win. If we make it accept File on branch-1-win, then we&apos;ll set ourselves up for merge conflicts later as we try to manage patches across the 2 branches.

&lt;p&gt;Makes sense. Feel free to file a Jira and I can pick it up. &lt;/p&gt;</comment>

I have confirmed that the existing tests fail when running as root on Linux, just like what you&apos;re experiencing when running as admin on Windows.  It&apos;s unrelated to this patch.  This might explain a few complaints I&apos;ve seen on the mailing lists from new engineers trying to contribute to Hadoop, but finding some unit tests failing immediately.  I&apos;ll try to track down those threads and help them out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I agree with sticking to the File APIs, because they give us the &quot;absolute truth&quot; as you said.  If the user is root/admin, then the disk is usable. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We&apos;re just left with a test issue.  We could change the tests to detect root/admin at runtime and then either skip the invalid tests with &lt;tt&gt;assumeTrue&lt;/tt&gt; or run different assertions.  On Linux, we could check the username against &quot;root&quot;.  On Windows, would it be sufficient to check that user is &quot;Administrator&quot;, or is it more complex than that?&lt;/p&gt;</comment>

&lt;p&gt;Thanks Chris for checking this out. Given that we have a symmetry with Unix I am +1 on the current patch. Maybe just add a comment to the test saying that it is expected to fail if run as root on Unix or in elevated context on Windows?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&apos;re just left with a test issue. We could change the tests to detect root/admin at runtime and then either skip the invalid tests with assumeTrue or run different assertions. On Linux, we could check the username against &quot;root&quot;. On Windows, would it be sufficient to check that user is &quot;Administrator&quot;, or is it more complex than that?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For Windows, it won&apos;t be as simple as string compare. Even checking whether a user is a member of the Administrators group is not the right behavior. We have to check whether the process is running elevated or not. This could be done in native code or via a cmd script as described &lt;a href=&quot;http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7985755/how-to-detect-if-cmd-is-running-as-administrator-has-elevated-privileges&quot; class=&quot;external-link&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. We could expose something like TestUtils#IsRunningElevated and disable/relax the test in that case, but this would be a separate Jira.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;What is the issue?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bikas, the issue is that the test fails when executed in the elevated context on Windows, or as root on Linux. &lt;/p&gt;</comment>

&lt;p&gt;On a side note, shouldn&apos;t we improve patch verifier to catch such issues? The reason the issue wasn&apos;t detected is that the robot doesn&apos;t run tests for modules which depend on the modified ones. Shouldn&apos;t we fix it?&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
