            <title>[HADOOP-6453] Hadoop wrapper script shouldn&apos;t ignore an existing JAVA_LIBRARY_PATH</title>
                <link>https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HADOOP-6453</link>
                <project id="12310240" key="HADOOP">Hadoop Common</project>
                    <description>&lt;p&gt;Currently the hadoop wrapper script assumes its the only place that uses JAVA_LIBRARY_PATH and initializes it to a blank line.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JAVA_LIBRARY_PATH=&apos;&apos;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This prevents anyone from setting this outside of the hadoop wrapper (say hadoop-config.sh) for their own native libraries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fix is pretty simple. Don&apos;t initialize it to &apos;&apos; and append the native libs like normal. &lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;There are no tests, its a wrapper script. Doesn&apos;t change the default behavior except for the unlikely case where people were setting JAVA_LIBRARY_PATH and it was getting stomped on and when its no longer stomped on they&apos;ll break. Very unlikely case.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>

Our deploy process currently involves updating to a new version and then manually commenting out the line that empties the JAVA_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable (i.e. an inferior version of applying Chad&apos;s patch).  We want to set JAVA_LIBRARY_PATH in hadoop-env.sh and have it used elsewhere, which this patch makes possible.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>

                            <comment id="12795044" author="steve_l" created="Tue, 29 Dec 2009 12:53:42 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;I don&apos;t use the startup scripts, so it doesn&apos;t have any effect to me, but I see the benefit for anyone who has native libs they do want in the runtime.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;There is a risk that this will break things, namely any system that has a JAVA_LIBRARY_PATH env variable set to something that is incompatible with HADOOP. This is the usual badly-configured CLASSPATH problem, the reason a lot of java launcher scripts either ignore that env variable completely, or provide some way to disable it (e.g. Ant&apos;s -noclasspath option)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;


&lt;ol&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Even if there is no automated test, someone needs to manually check that if the existing value of  JAVA_LIBRARY_PATH is set to something with spaces in, such as c:\Program Files\some application\ then everything still propagates correctly. As usual, Cygwin will be the troublespot here.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

                            <comment id="12795051" author="steve_l" created="Tue, 29 Dec 2009 13:45:50 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
I should add that it&apos;s script patches that have the greatest cost/line in Ant; we dropped support for win9x not because java didn&apos;t work on it, but the .BAT syntax was weaker and we couldn&apos;t face debugging it. Windows + Cygwin is equally trouble, so before any patch goes in we really need to think about how to test on that platform.  &lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="12795088" author="metcalfc" created="Tue, 29 Dec 2009 17:39:27 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;Added:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;code panel&quot; style=&quot;border-width: 1px;&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;codeContent panelContent&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;code-java&quot;&gt;JAVA_LIBRARY_PATH=`cygpath -p -w &lt;span class=&quot;code-quote&quot;&gt;&quot;$JAVA_LIBRARY_PATH&quot;&lt;/span&gt;`
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For trunk and 0.20 in the appropriate places. This now receives the same level of protection that &lt;tt&gt;CLASSPATH&lt;/tt&gt; does. As I acknowledged above there is indeed a possibility that a user will have a broken &lt;tt&gt;JAVA_LIBRARY_PATH&lt;/tt&gt; and this will break for them. That possibility is slim. A quick google of &lt;tt&gt;JAVA_LIBRARY_PATH&lt;/tt&gt; brings this jira up as #5 which indicates its a significantly less common env then &lt;tt&gt;CLASSPATH&lt;/tt&gt;.  Regardless the possibility exists. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the cygpath fix above this change makes every reasonable effort to protect cygwin users. Which places them in the same boat as all the other bash users (Linux, Mac, Solaris, etc). If you have a broken env there is nothing I can do. It would the same if you had a broken &lt;tt&gt;CLASSPATH&lt;/tt&gt;. As with all possibly breaking changes there is a trade off between the users that need the functionality and the users it will break.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Users that need to get native libraries in as it stands have to hack the wrapper. This is tedious and error prone over setting a env. And its not immediately obvious that its what you have to do. The wrapper script respects &lt;tt&gt;CLASSPATH&lt;/tt&gt; logically it should respect others. And its not documented that if you want to do this, oh by the way you have to hack this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&apos;m all for testing. But the risk here is broken user env&apos;s which is not something in the scope of this jira to address. We can test the patch and add a release note so that if it breaks someone they can read that this was changed. If people are really that worried about it we can add:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;code panel&quot; style=&quot;border-width: 1px;&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;codeContent panelContent&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;code-java&quot;&gt;echo &lt;span class=&quot;code-quote&quot;&gt;&quot;Existing JAVA_LIBRARY_PATH detected, &lt;span class=&quot;code-keyword&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; things are breaking please check &lt;span class=&quot;code-keyword&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt; first.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But most likely that will just send someone who breaks for a different reason off on a 5 minute wild goose chase.&lt;/p&gt;

They can break it in so many ways that it&apos;s impossible to fix; the classic enemy is the quotation marks halfway through PATH; this screws up the quote logic and your scripts don&apos;t stand a chance, not in anything vaguely cross platform. Perl or Python entry scripts, that&apos;s a different story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For bash, the cygpath patch should be enough.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&apos;ve been thinking about how to test this.  TestCLI can be used to run stuff on the command line, all we need is a hadoop diagnostics command whose output includes all the env variables. If JAVA_LIBRARY_PATH is then set to values with and without a space in in different test cases (that will be the tricky bit; may need some extensions to the cli execution), the test could look for the value in the output. I will file that as a separate feature. &lt;/p&gt;</comment>

To automate a command line check needs the cli tester to excec the shell scripts, which it doesnt (yet), or use some other testrunner &lt;del&gt;antunit is the obvious choice&lt;/del&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</comment>

However, this seems like a good change to make with essentially no risk.  This will treat JAVA_LIBRARY_PATH consistently with JAVA_HOME, and can be marked as incompatible change.  cygwin should be fine.  Chad, can you please spin up a new patch and, barring any objections, I&apos;ll review and commit it.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>

&lt;p&gt;Please review.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="13147877" author="tbroberg" created="Thu, 10 Nov 2011 18:14:31 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;  if [ -e &quot;${HADOOP_PREFIX}/lib/libhadoop.a&quot; ]; then&lt;br/&gt;
    JAVA_LIBRARY_PATH=${HADOOP_PREFIX}/lib&lt;br/&gt;
  fi&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It appears that the patched script discards all other JAVA_LIBRARY_PATH definitions if there is a libhadoop.a file.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is this by design?&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
