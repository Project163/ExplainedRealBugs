            <title>[HADOOP-7810] move hadoop archive to core from tools</title>
                <link>https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HADOOP-7810</link>
                <project id="12310240" key="HADOOP">Hadoop Common</project>
                    <description>&lt;p&gt;&quot;The HadoopArchieves classes are included in the $HADOOP_HOME/hadoop_tools.jar, but this file is not found in `hadoop classpath`.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A Pig script using HCatalog&apos;s dynamic partitioning with HAR enabled will therefore fail if a jar with HAR is not included in the pig call&apos;s &apos;-cp&apos; and &apos;-Dpig.additional.jars&apos; arguments.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am not aware of any reason to not include hadoop-tools.jar in &apos;hadoop classpath&apos;. Will attach a patch soon.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;I was looking at the hadoop script in 0.23 and saw the following and assumed that &quot;TOOL_PATH needs to be exported in 0.23 as well&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;code panel&quot; style=&quot;border-width: 1px;&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;codeContent panelContent&quot;&gt;

      CLASS=org.apache.hadoop.tools.HadoopArchives
      CLASSPATH=${CLASSPATH}:${TOOL_PATH}

                            <comment id="13147182" author="tucu00" created="Wed, 9 Nov 2011 17:46:49 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;Owen you have a point. However, this is a bit difficult for any of the tools bundled with Hadoop itself. One option would be to have a separate hadoop-tools project.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>

@Owen - Could you help me understand how it will be more difficult than it is today? Also, do you have an alternative recommendation?&lt;/p&gt;</comment>

Until we have a better story for how to get modules onto the bin/hadoop classpath, I&apos;d propose that instead of this that you move the HarFileSystem (and only the HarFileSystem) into the hadoop-core jar.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>

                            <comment id="13148068" author="johnvijoe" created="Thu, 10 Nov 2011 22:38:21 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;I am attaching a patch which moves HadoopArchives.java as part of core. I ran some basic tests, but I need to run more tests before I can &apos;Submit Patch&apos;. Also, the patch format is not &quot;apply-able&quot;. But, I am hoping that you could take a look and confirm that this is the direction you meant in your previous comment.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="13149734" author="johnvijoe" created="Mon, 14 Nov 2011 16:45:17 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;@Todd - Bringing the discussion about this JIRA from &apos;common-dev&apos; to here.&lt;br/&gt;
Quoting Todd: &quot;This seems like an incompatible change - probably a bad idea for a dot&lt;br/&gt;
release of a dot release of a maintenance series....&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Todd - Most of the HAR features never really worked in branch-0.20 before 0.20.205. Since 205 is probably the first branch-0.20 release with full fledged HAR, do you still consider it an incompatible change?&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="13149753" author="johnvijoe" created="Mon, 14 Nov 2011 17:12:44 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;Completed the testing I was planning to do:&lt;br/&gt;
1. Created HAR &lt;br/&gt;
2. listed files&lt;br/&gt;
3. sorted a HAR file&lt;br/&gt;
4. wc on a HAR file&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="13149946" author="owen.omalley" created="Mon, 14 Nov 2011 21:32:03 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;I&apos;m sorry, I&apos;m confused. I thought the point of this jira was to fix the HarFileSystem into the classpath, but I see that it already there. I don&apos;t think we should move the tool to the mapreduce jar. What is the use case that requires the har tool to be on the classpath?&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="13150163" author="esoren" created="Tue, 15 Nov 2011 01:56:38 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;@Owen - The use case is for a storing from a Pig script using HCatalog&apos;s dynamic partitioning and with HAR enabled.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Correct, the HarFileSystem is in the classpath.&lt;br/&gt;
But a call like the above fails with a ClassNotFoundException on org.apache.hadoop.tools.HadoopArchives$HArchiveInputFormat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Therefore the suggestion to move the HadoopArchieves classes from hadoop_tools jar, which is not in `hadoop classpath`, into the hadoop-core jar. (The same jar that holds the HarFileSystem class.)&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="13150259" author="owen.omalley" created="Tue, 15 Nov 2011 06:34:16 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;In that case, why doesn&apos;t HCatalog put hadoop-tools.jar on its classpath? Why should hadoop-tools be any different than any of its other dependencies?&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="13152377" author="thw" created="Thu, 17 Nov 2011 21:54:11 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;Every downstream project would need to modify its class path to make this happen (Pig, HCatalog etc.). This would be necessary for any other dependency, but here we deal with a component that is already deployed with Hadoop and we would like to be able to configure it as part of Hadoop. We would prefer a solution that involves a single stop?&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="13152482" author="thw" created="Fri, 18 Nov 2011 00:02:42 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;Looking ahead .23 already has HadoopArchives in the path. So why can we not have the same setup for .20? &lt;/p&gt;

I guess for now just add the tools jar to the end of the classpath after the user&apos;s jars. You&apos;ll need to make the change in trunk, 0.23 and 0.20.2xx.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We really should also fix the tools jar back to its old name (hadoop-tools-$version.jar), because otherwise upstream users can&apos;t find it.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>

Making the change as per Owen&apos;s suggestion - that is adding TOOLS_JAR to the end of CLASSPATH so that the current behavior is preserved and the TOOLS_JAR is in the classpath as well.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>

                            <comment id="13156388" author="johnvijoe" created="Wed, 23 Nov 2011 23:21:41 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;I did not see it defined either, but since mavenization is going on, some of the jar files might move around. As of now, har/distcp are part of hadoop-mapreduce-tools jar. I believe it will move out of there to hadoop-tools (&lt;a href=&quot;https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/MAPREDUCE-2765&quot; title=&quot;DistCp Rewrite&quot; class=&quot;issue-link&quot; data-issue-key=&quot;MAPREDUCE-2765&quot;&gt;&lt;del&gt;MAPREDUCE-2765&lt;/del&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). So, I think it might be better to wait till those changes are in before putting out a trunk patch - what do you say? &lt;/p&gt;</comment>

I&apos;ve committed the change to 205 + security. If you can make a patch for trunk (actually defining the TOOL_PATH), that would be great.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>

Are you saying that we should assume it will continue in hadoop-mapreduce-tools? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are two JIRAs where discussions are ongoing about mavenization and location (&lt;a href=&quot;https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/MAPREDUCE-2765&quot; title=&quot;DistCp Rewrite&quot; class=&quot;issue-link&quot; data-issue-key=&quot;MAPREDUCE-2765&quot;&gt;&lt;del&gt;MAPREDUCE-2765&lt;/del&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/MAPREDUCE-3467&quot; title=&quot;Mavenizing har&quot; class=&quot;issue-link&quot; data-issue-key=&quot;MAPREDUCE-3467&quot;&gt;&lt;del&gt;MAPREDUCE-3467&lt;/del&gt;&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;</comment>

&lt;p&gt;I think this was intended to be added to the &quot;Target Versions&quot; list.&lt;br/&gt;
Only adding 0.23.1 since also adding it to trunk is implicit.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>

Those users are expecting the behavior to not change in sustaining releases. While this behavior from our users will go away soon, making this change in a sustaining release seems to be too risky. Could we revert this change and move this to the 0.23/trunk? I was the one who was trying to push this change, but I did not forsee something like this happening and hence the request. &lt;/p&gt;</comment>

&lt;p&gt;Attached there is script and patch that moves HARFileSystem to hadoop-common and HadoopArchives to tools.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A small tweak in HadoopArchives and its testclass was required to run with the new MiniMR.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regarding on how this new JAR ends up in the distro, there is another JIRA for that, &lt;a href=&quot;https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HADOOP-7907&quot; title=&quot;hadoop-tools JARs are not part of the distro&quot; class=&quot;issue-link&quot; data-issue-key=&quot;HADOOP-7907&quot;&gt;&lt;del&gt;HADOOP-7907&lt;/del&gt;&lt;/a&gt; .&lt;/p&gt;

I just finished looking into the patch. This patch seems to do two things.&lt;br/&gt;
1. Move hadoop archives into hadoop-tools and harfilesystem into common. This seems fine to me. &lt;br/&gt;
2. Add TOOL_PATH to the classpath by default. I have two comments in this case. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;TOOL_PATH is not defined yet. What will this be defined to?&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Adding TOOL_PATH to the classpath by default did break 0.20 as mentioned, but that was because of a separate distcp being used by the user. While I dont anticipate that to be the case in 0.23, I just dint know if that was going to be an issue for anyone else?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks for looking at it. I&apos;m a bit confused, the trunk patch does only #1. For #2 HADOOP_7907 will take care of packaging the tools jars and making them avail to the hadoop scripts.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>

&lt;p&gt;Thanks for looking at it. I&apos;m a bit confused, the trunk patch does only #1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was looking at my own patch instead of the one you submitted! Sorry for the confusion.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>

I did a simple &apos;create har&apos; and then &apos;list har&apos; test, just to ensure that the move to separate hars did work fine for each of the functionalities in those jars. &lt;br/&gt;
The only minor issue I saw was that I had to change hadoop-tools/pom.xml to reflect that it was &apos;0.23.1-SNAPSHOT&apos; and not &apos;0.24&apos;. &lt;br/&gt;
I am +1 pending the change to get it compiled on 0.23.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Good work Alejandro! Thanks a lot for doing this.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>

&lt;p&gt;I&apos;ll commit both shortly&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
