            <title>[HADOOP-9413] Introduce common utils for File#setReadable/Writable/Executable and File#canRead/Write/Execute that work cross-platform</title>
                <link>https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HADOOP-9413</link>
                <project id="12310240" key="HADOOP">Hadoop Common</project>
                    <description>&lt;p&gt;So far, we&apos;ve seen many unittest and product bugs in Hadoop on Windows because Java&apos;s APIs that manipulate with permissions do not work as expected. We&apos;ve addressed many of these problems on one-by-one basis (by either changing code a bit or disabling the test). While debugging the remaining unittest failures we continue to run into the same patterns of problems, and instead of addressing them one-by-one, I propose that we expose a set of equivalent wrapper APIs that will work well for all platforms. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scanning thru the codebase, this will actually be a simple change as there are very few places that use File#setReadable/Writable/Executable and File#canRead/Write/Execute (5 files in Common, 9 files in HDFS). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HADOOP-8973&quot; title=&quot;DiskChecker cannot reliably detect an inaccessible disk on Windows with NTFS ACLs&quot; class=&quot;issue-link&quot; data-issue-key=&quot;HADOOP-8973&quot;&gt;&lt;del&gt;HADOOP-8973&lt;/del&gt;&lt;/a&gt; contains additional context on the problem.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

                            <comment id="13605951" author="ivanmi" created="Tue, 19 Mar 2013 02:17:16 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;Attaching early version of the patch. At this point I&apos;m looking for feedback on some points from below. I also have to do some additional testing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few points I&apos;m interesting in hearing other peoples opinion:&lt;br/&gt;
1. At the moment, I did not expose File#set* APIs that accept the &lt;tt&gt;ownerOnly&lt;/tt&gt; parameter. Adding this is strait forward, the only question is whether we need it. I didn&apos;t find use-cases in Common and HDFS projects, but I&apos;ve seen some in Yarn (only on one or two places, and those could be changed to use chmod instead).&lt;br/&gt;
2. For File#canRead/canWrite/canExecute I check whether the current user has read/write/execute permissions on the given File thru winutils. This is generally fine from the correctness perspective as winutils provide a POSIX compatible view of Windows ACLs. However, this is different than what we did in &lt;a href=&quot;https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HADOOP-8973&quot; title=&quot;DiskChecker cannot reliably detect an inaccessible disk on Windows with NTFS ACLs&quot; class=&quot;issue-link&quot; data-issue-key=&quot;HADOOP-8973&quot;&gt;&lt;del&gt;HADOOP-8973&lt;/del&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Will have to think a bit more about pros and cons but I&apos;m definitely interested in getting input from others. (btw, I&apos;m running as admin, so this makes things a bit easier for me &lt;img class=&quot;emoticon&quot; src=&quot;https://issues.apache.org/jira/images/icons/emoticons/smile.png&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; width=&quot;16&quot; align=&quot;absmiddle&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot;/&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="13609323" author="cnauroth" created="Thu, 21 Mar 2013 19:10:12 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;I&apos;ve spotted another instance of this problem, in YARN nodemanager &lt;tt&gt;NodeHealthScriptRunner#shouldRun&lt;/tt&gt;, which checks &lt;tt&gt;File#canExecute&lt;/tt&gt;, and we&apos;ve already seen that this is unreliable on Windows.  The problem manifests as a test failure in &lt;tt&gt;TestNodeHealthService&lt;/tt&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I expect I&apos;ll get a chance to review this proposal within the next few days.  Thanks for investigating this, Ivan!&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="13612362" author="ivanmi" created="Mon, 25 Mar 2013 02:52:02 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;Thanks Chris!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&apos;ve spotted another instance of this problem, in YARN nodemanager NodeHealthScriptRunner#shouldRun, which checks File#canExecute, and we&apos;ve already seen that this is unreliable on Windows. The problem manifests as a test failure in TestNodeHealthService.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I created &lt;a href=&quot;https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/YARN-506&quot; title=&quot;Move to common utils FileUtil#setReadable/Writable/Executable and FileUtil#canRead/Write/Execute&quot; class=&quot;issue-link&quot; data-issue-key=&quot;YARN-506&quot;&gt;&lt;del&gt;YARN-506&lt;/del&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and attached a patch that makes the appropriate changes in the yarn codebase.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Btw, I noticed a single place in the mapreduce project which calls File#canExecute. Will file a separate Jira for this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;1. At the moment, I did not expose File#set* APIs that accept the ownerOnly parameter. Adding this is strait forward, the only question is whether we need it. I didn&apos;t find use-cases in Common and HDFS projects, but I&apos;ve seen some in Yarn (only on one or two places, and those could be changed to use chmod instead).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To also respond to my earlier comment from above. I don&apos;t think we need to expose these APIs, at least not yet. I found only a single occurrence where these APIs are used, and using chmod as a replacement seems appropriate. &lt;/p&gt;</comment>

&lt;div class=&quot;code panel&quot; style=&quot;border-width: 1px;&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;codeContent panelContent&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;code-java&quot;&gt;+        &lt;span class=&quot;code-keyword&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; (ugi.getShortUserName().equals(status.getOwner())
+            || Arrays.asList(ugi.getGroupNames()).contains(status.getOwner())) {
+          &lt;span class=&quot;code-keyword&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; (user.implies(FsAction.READ)) {
+            &lt;span class=&quot;code-keyword&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;code-keyword&quot;&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;;
+          }
+        }
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This seems to revert the decisions made in &lt;a href=&quot;https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HADOOP-8973&quot; title=&quot;DiskChecker cannot reliably detect an inaccessible disk on Windows with NTFS ACLs&quot; class=&quot;issue-link&quot; data-issue-key=&quot;HADOOP-8973&quot;&gt;&lt;del&gt;HADOOP-8973&lt;/del&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that checking for an owner match and &lt;tt&gt;FsAction#implies&lt;/tt&gt; is insufficient in the presence of other permission mechanisms, such as ACLs.  In this case though, your patch keeps this logic guarded behind an if (Windows) check, so it wouldn&apos;t sacrifice existing functionality for any existing Linux deployments that use POSIX ACLs.  Just so I&apos;m clear, is this a proposal that we accept it as a known limitation on Windows right now, with potential follow-up work to address it later (via JDK7 or possibly JNI calls)?  That seems to be implicit in the patch, but I want to make sure I understand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, can you please clarify the second part of the if condition?  This is checking if one of the user&apos;s group memberships has the same name as the file owner.  Is it supposed to check the file group instead of the file owner?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks!&lt;/p&gt;</comment>

&lt;p&gt;I added a comment above asking for opinion on this one. This approach provides full symmetry between can* and set* functions on Windows, what I think is a good thing for now. I agree that we&apos;ll want to improve this eventually (this could be JDK7 or JNI). However, as long as the abstractions are solid, I think we are good. Let me know what you think.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks, will add a comment to clarify this part. On Windows, the owner can also be a group. One use-case is if I&apos;m running as a member of the admins group (elevated), and create a file, the file will be owned by the admins group.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="13615506" author="bikassaha" created="Wed, 27 Mar 2013 17:13:56 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;Chris already has code that does the expected thing for the scenario in which the running process is checking whether it has read/write/execute permissions on a directory. We could move them into helper functions and use them. This is important because after this check is successful the process goes ahead and performs the action that depends on the check. So my preference would be to use the code that provides the expected functionality. We can improve that code later on.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>

&lt;p&gt;However, as long as the abstractions are solid, I think we are good. Let me know what you think.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, I am definitely in favor of the structure of this patch: providing common utility wrappers for these methods.  I think the only open question is whether the implementation should revert the logic of &lt;a href=&quot;https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HADOOP-8973&quot; title=&quot;DiskChecker cannot reliably detect an inaccessible disk on Windows with NTFS ACLs&quot; class=&quot;issue-link&quot; data-issue-key=&quot;HADOOP-8973&quot;&gt;&lt;del&gt;HADOOP-8973&lt;/del&gt;&lt;/a&gt; like this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chris already has code that does the expected thing for the scenario in which the running process is checking whether it has read/write/execute permissions on a directory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A couple of caveats on this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The code I wrote for &lt;a href=&quot;https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HADOOP-8973&quot; title=&quot;DiskChecker cannot reliably detect an inaccessible disk on Windows with NTFS ACLs&quot; class=&quot;issue-link&quot; data-issue-key=&quot;HADOOP-8973&quot;&gt;&lt;del&gt;HADOOP-8973&lt;/del&gt;&lt;/a&gt; works only for directories, and we need these common APIs to handle both files and directories.  See Ivan&apos;s patches on &lt;a href=&quot;https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HDFS-4610&quot; title=&quot;Move to using common utils FileUtil#setReadable/Writable/Executable and FileUtil#canRead/Write/Execute&quot; class=&quot;issue-link&quot; data-issue-key=&quot;HDFS-4610&quot;&gt;&lt;del&gt;HDFS-4610&lt;/del&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/YARN-506&quot; title=&quot;Move to common utils FileUtil#setReadable/Writable/Executable and FileUtil#canRead/Write/Execute&quot; class=&quot;issue-link&quot; data-issue-key=&quot;YARN-506&quot;&gt;&lt;del&gt;YARN-506&lt;/del&gt;&lt;/a&gt; for some examples where the codebase needs to get/set permissions on individual files.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;There was also the question of performance, because my code actually performed file access and forked new processes to implement the access checks.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;


&lt;p&gt;These were not problems for &lt;a href=&quot;https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HADOOP-8973&quot; title=&quot;DiskChecker cannot reliably detect an inaccessible disk on Windows with NTFS ACLs&quot; class=&quot;issue-link&quot; data-issue-key=&quot;HADOOP-8973&quot;&gt;&lt;del&gt;HADOOP-8973&lt;/del&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, because &lt;tt&gt;DiskChecker&lt;/tt&gt; is used only for directories and it&apos;s used rarely enough that the performance impact would likely be unnoticeable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&apos;m wondering if it&apos;s time for us to write a JNI call to &lt;tt&gt;AccessCheck&lt;/tt&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/aa374815(v=vs.85).aspx&quot; class=&quot;external-link&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener&quot;&gt;http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/aa374815(v=vs.85).aspx&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This would only be used if (Windows &amp;amp;&amp;amp; JDKversion &amp;lt; 7).  Otherwise, we expect the JDK APIs to work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Obviously, this will take longer to implement.  A potential compromise would be to go with the patch&apos;s current implementation of the new functions, but leave &lt;tt&gt;DiskChecker&lt;/tt&gt; as is temporarily, just until we get the JNI call written.  That way, the other permission checks in the codebase get pretty close to working (not 100% correct, but certainly better than the current state), and we still maintain full correctness for the very important &lt;tt&gt;DiskChecker&lt;/tt&gt; piece.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ivan and Bikas, do you have any follow-up thoughts?&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="13618472" author="bikassaha" created="Sun, 31 Mar 2013 21:18:28 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;I am in favor of any proposal that leaves the code and expected functionality consistent. Ideally, structurally similar and functionally correct. Structurally similar but functionally broken may be acceptable for the short term as long as non-Windows continues to run correctly. What I would be wary of is leaving the code in a situation where it works in A but not in B because that is a pain to read, debug and maintain.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="13618560" author="ivanmi" created="Mon, 1 Apr 2013 02:05:19 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;Thanks Chris and Bikas for the review comments! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bikas, the current patch gets things moving forward on Windows and there are no changes to the current behavior on non-Windows platforms. The patch just builds on top of the current design where Hadoop sees Windows as a POSIX compatible OS w.r.t. local file system access. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given Chris&#8217; input from above where the previous logic from &lt;a href=&quot;https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HADOOP-8973&quot; title=&quot;DiskChecker cannot reliably detect an inaccessible disk on Windows with NTFS ACLs&quot; class=&quot;issue-link&quot; data-issue-key=&quot;HADOOP-8973&quot;&gt;&lt;del&gt;HADOOP-8973&lt;/del&gt;&lt;/a&gt; works only on folders, my take is to proceed with one of the following:&lt;br/&gt;
a. The approach from the current patch&lt;br/&gt;
b. JNI implementation which will handle access checks on the ACLs level and provide a more natural integration with Windows&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me spend a few days investigating what would it take to implement b) and understanding the implications of this approach for Hadoop on Windows. It is definitely worth spending a bit of time on this. If this turns out to be strait forward, I&#8217;ll address it as part of this patch. If not, we can start with a new Jira and iterate thru problems. Let me know if this sounds good.&lt;/p&gt;

I went in the direction of exposing a native access check API as Chris&#8217; suggested above. The problem with the previous patch that bothered me was that it used the owner information to do the access check, what is not accurate in all cases on Windows (a user can still read/write/exec files/folders even if he is not a user/group owner). The new access check API checks if a user has the appropriate read/write/execute permission by checking the file ACLs. Another good side is that API could be substituted with JDK7 Files#isReadable/isWritable/isExecutable once Hadoop moves to Java 7.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;libwinutils.c: I noticed that GetEffectiveRightsForSid() does not do proper cleanup so I fixed that with my patch as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Enums with defined value will make this unnecessary. Minor though but typesafe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;code panel&quot; style=&quot;border-width: 1px;&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;codeContent panelContent&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;code-java&quot;&gt;+      &lt;span class=&quot;code-keyword&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; (desiredAccess != ACCESS_READ &amp;amp;&amp;amp; desiredAccess != ACCESS_WRITE
+          &amp;amp;&amp;amp; desiredAccess != ACCESS_EXECUTE) {
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The previous code was returning error when this failed. Not necessary anymore?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;code panel&quot; style=&quot;border-width: 1px;&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;codeContent panelContent&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;code-java&quot;&gt;-  &lt;span class=&quot;code-keyword&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; (!AuthzFreeContext(hAuthzClientContext))
+
+GetEffectiveRightsForSidEnd:
+  &lt;span class=&quot;code-keyword&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; (hManager != NULL)
   {
-    ret = GetLastError();
-    &lt;span class=&quot;code-keyword&quot;&gt;goto&lt;/span&gt; GetEffectiveRightsForSidEnd;
+    (void)AuthzFreeResourceManager(hManager);

+  {
+    (void)AuthzFreeContext(hAuthzClientContext);
   }
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How about changing these to setWritable()? Thus testing the other new methods too. + end to end symmetry check also achieved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;code panel&quot; style=&quot;border-width: 1px;&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;codeContent panelContent&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I attached the updated patch with your feedback addressed. Some comments below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Enums with defined value will make this unnecessary. Minor though but typesafe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Makes sense, thanks, fixed in this iteration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The previous code was returning error when this failed. Not necessary anymore?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was intentional. Resources allocated by a function should always be freed, whatever the function outcome is. LocalFree/CloseHandle and similar routines generally never fail except when the passed in parameters are invalid (what will not be the case here).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;How about changing these to setWritable()? Thus testing the other new methods too. + end to end symmetry check also achieved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Agreed, since we already use FileUtil APIs, fixed in this iteration.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>

&lt;p&gt;I noticed that hadoop.dll is not added to the java library path in the downstream Hadoop projects, causing some tests to fail with UnsatisfiedLinkError. Let&apos;s hold on committing this Jira until I prepare a fix for that.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>

&lt;p&gt;In parallel, I have a few questions/comments on the latest patch:&lt;br/&gt;
1. hadoop-project/pom.xml: It seems that the currently defined value for LD_LIBRARY_PATH is invalid. I think it should have the following value:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;code panel&quot; style=&quot;border-width: 1px;&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;codeContent panelContent&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;code-java&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;LD_LIBRARY_PATH&amp;gt;${env.LD_LIBRARY_PATH}:${project.build.directory}/&lt;span class=&quot;code-keyword&quot;&gt;native&lt;/span&gt;/target/usr/local/lib:${basedir}/../../hadoop-common-project/hadoop-common/target/bin&amp;lt;/LD_LIBRARY_PATH&amp;gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2. hadoop-project/pom.xml: Assuming that we specified a valid value for LD_LIBRARY_PATH above, the following section might not be needed:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;code panel&quot; style=&quot;border-width: 1px;&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;codeContent panelContent&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;code-java&quot;&gt;                &amp;lt;!-- Specify where to look &lt;span class=&quot;code-keyword&quot;&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; the &lt;span class=&quot;code-keyword&quot;&gt;native&lt;/span&gt; DLL on Windows --&amp;gt;
                &amp;lt;PATH&amp;gt;${env.PATH};${basedir}/../../hadoop-common-project/hadoop-common/target/bin&amp;lt;/PATH&amp;gt;
                &amp;lt;PATH&amp;gt;${env.PATH};${hadoop.common.build.dir}/bin&amp;lt;/PATH&amp;gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3. Other pom.xml files: Can we just define a new value for LD_LIBRARY_PATH next to HADOOP_HOME and point it to the appropriate /target/bin folder in every subproject? This would provide a nice symmetry with how we locate winutils on Windows.&lt;br/&gt;
4. Might make sense to either remove hadoop.common.build.dir or use it for both winutils.exe and hadoop.dll&lt;/p&gt;</comment>

I&apos;ve pasted that comment below.&lt;/p&gt;
